Hahaha, I don't believe it
Da, da, ah, ah don't touch me
Hey ray, hey sugar, tell them who we are
Well, we're big rock singers
We got golden fingers
And we're loved everywhere we go (that sounds like us)
We sing about beauty and we sing about truth
At ten thousand dollars a show (right)
We take all kinds of pills that give us all kind of thrills
But the thrill we've never known
Is the thrill that'll getcha when you get your picture
On the cover of the Rollin' Stone
wanna see my picture on the cover
Stone wanna buy five copies for my mother (yes)
Stone wanna see my smilin' face
On the cover of the Rollin' Stone (that's a very, very good idea)
I got a freaky ol' lady, name of Cocaine Katy
Who embroiders on my jeans
I got my poor ol' grey-haired daddy
Drivin' my limousine
Now it's all designed to blow our minds
But our minds won't really be blown
Like the blow that'll getcha when you get your picture
On the cover of the Rollin' Stone
wanna see our pictures on the cover
Stone wanna buy five copies for our mothers (yeah)
Stone wanna see my smilin face
On the cover of the Rollin' Stone
Hey, I know how (sure enough)
Rock and roll
Ah, that's beautiful
We got a lot of little teenage blue-eyed groupies
Who do anything we say
We got a genuine Indian guru
He's teaching us a better way
We got all the friends that money can buy
So we never have to be alone
And we keep gettin' richer but we can't get our picture
On the cover of the Rollin' Stone
wanna see my picture on the cover
Stone wanna buy five copies for my mother (I want one)
Stone wanna see my smilin' face
On the cover of the Rollin' Stone
On the cover of the Rollin'
Stone gonna see my picture on the cover
"I don't know why we ain't on the cover, baby"
Stone wanna buy five copies for my mother
"We're beautiful fellas"
Stone wanna see my smilin' face
"I ain't kiddin' ya, oh, we would make a beautiful cover"
On the cover of the Rollin' Stone
"A fresh shot, right up front, man"
"I can see it now, we'll be on the front"
"Smilin', man"
"Aah, beautiful"
