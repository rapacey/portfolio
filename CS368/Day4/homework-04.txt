His
eagerness
made
her
suddenly
want
to
be
intelligent
again
Under
his
dynamic
tutelage
she
started
reading
not
the
literature
of
her
childhood
but
hard
politics
sociology
philosophy
ideas
and
experimental
fiction
To
please
him
she
learned
to
talk
about
what
she
read
and
what
she
thought
He
was
and
she
forced
herself
to
remember
this
with
gratitude
one
of
the
best
talkers
she
had
ever
met
funny
and
fast
Passionate
and
unashamed
A
man
who
could
and
would
talk
the
hind
legs
back
on
to
an
injured
donkey
provided
it
had
decent
proletarian
credentials
They
had
all
learned
from
him
she
and
Lisa
still
spoke
stylistically
as
he
had
taught
them
to
He
had
set
his
mark
on
them
Where
was
he
now
Phoebe
lying
on
her
bed
in
her
mother's
house
in
north
London
asked
herself
with
a
sudden
rush
of
nostalgia
In
what
corner
of
what
foreign
field
did
he
still
keep
the
faith
further
the
revolution
wake
up
his
current
lover
at
three
in
the
morning
to
discuss
the
delicate
interweavings
of
class
and
race
She
could
not
bear
to
think
that
he
had
taken
all
that
pure
wrathful
zeal
into
marketing
or
insurance
broking
Occasionally
she
half
hoped
to
see
him
again
she
would
find
herself
watching
faces
rising
towards
her
on
the
escalator
of
the
Tube
and
wonder
what
she
would
feel
if
one
of
those
faces
were
suddenly
to
be
his
Where
had
they
all
gone
those
extraordinary
skinny
left-wing
men
who
had
bullied
their
girl-friends
into
the
Women's
Movement
and
been
surprised
when
the
hand
with
which
they
had
so
kindly
offered
freedom
had
been
bitten
so
damn
hard
Nearly
twenty
years
later
Phoebe
still
found
it
hard
to
suppress
a
little
vindictive
chuckle
at
the
looks
of
growing
shock
on
Jim's
face
Jim
and
Lisa's
Jonathan
and
Sue's
Alan
when
they
discovered
that
their
righteousness
was
not
enough
Their
women
far
from
being
grateful
turned
on
them
snarling
in
late
night
conversations
telling
them
to
shut
up
far
from
setting
them
free
to
work
for
the
Revolution
their
women
demanded
that
they
take
emotional
responsibility
and
also
clean
the
loos
And
finally
only
a
year
or
so
later
turned
them
out
of
house
and
home
put
them
on
the
street
as
women
who
failed
to
be
properly
grateful
to
the
fathers
had
been
put
for
centuries
But
even
as
she
chuckled
Phoebe
knew
now
that
this
was
not
fair
There
had
been
a
time
a
brief
time
a
glorious
dawn
when
despite
her
growing
awareness
of
her
own
sexual
failure
despite
her
anger
and
frustration
despite
her
own
laziness
and
lack
of
commitment
there
had
been
a
time
when
she
had
been
happy
and
hopeful
and
joyous
It
had
not
as
it
turned
out
been
Jim
that
had
made
the
happiness
for
her
but
the
house
itself
However
he
with
his
determined
hands
and
determined
nose
had
been
her
way
in
She
did
not
know
where
he
was
now
and
she
did
not
really
care
but
he
had
probably
been
the
most
influential
person
in
her
life
her
handsome
prince
and
Maggie's
father
He
had
given
her
that
household
a
little
society
warming
itself
in
its
own
glow
of
virtue
insulating
itself
from
the
big
bad
world
but
within
its
own
limits
it
had
been
open
and
supportive
She
had
during
that
year
woken
some
mornings
giddy
with
courage
and
boldness
excited
and
certain
Motivated
It
had
been
however
briefly
a
time
when
her
body
and
her
mind
had
fitted
together
so
tidily
and
wholely
that
waking
up
one
morning
and
deciding
that
it
was
time
to
go
back
to
Oxford
and
visit
her
mother
was
neither
traumatic
nor
casual
but
straightforward
She
had
discussed
it
with
her
family
hugged
Lisa
and
Sue
kissed
Jim
left
home
and
taken
the
tube
to
Acton
where
she
stuck
out
her
thumb
on
the
edge
of
the
A40
on
a
smiling
spring
day
and
gone
home
Had
that
she
wondered
now
been
a
mistake
A
kindly
lorry
driver
on
his
way
to
North
Wales
chatting
of
his
own
daughter
and
his
home
had
dropped
her
at
the
roundabout
at
the
top
of
the
Banbury
Road
at
about
lunch-time
She
had
walked
down
through
suburban
Summertown
taking
her
time
but
without
reluctance
watching
the
tidiness
of
the
shoppers
and
the
smartness
of
the
shops
with
something
akin
to
smugness
how
little
energy
and
vitality
they
had
compared
to
her
own
shopping
street
with
its
untidy
market
atmosphere
permeating
even
the
Safeways
and
Boots
which
had
tried
to
raise
their
modern
never-had-it-so-good
fa
ades
in
challenge
to
the
poverty
and
squalor
and
had
failed
Two
blocks
away
from
the
house
of
her
childhood
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
her
mother
might
have
left
that
there
might
be
strangers
in
the
hallway
a
different
set
of
curtains
hanging
at
the
windows
her
father's
study
might
have
been
turned
into
a
playroom
for
a
new
generation
of
North
Oxford
children
so
different
from
herself
in
her
prim
Clark's
T-bar
sandals
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
recognise
her
own
infancy
in
theirs
It
would
be
too
humiliating
to
have
to
contact
her
mother
through
her
publishers
or
her
employers
How
could
one
ring
a
bell
on
a
house
door
in
respectable
places
like
this
and
say
Excuse
me
does
my
mother
live
here
That
was
the
stuff
of
melodrama
and
now
she
was
back
in
Oxford
she
knew
she
was
somewhere
somehow
still
too
middle-class
too
much
her
father's
daughter
to
want
that
This
was
leafy
north
Oxford
this
was
the
pace
of
security
This
was
the
corner
to
which
she
had
tottered
her
mother
holding
her
on
white
leather
reins
her
legs
encased
in
knitted
leggings
whose
scratchiness
she
could
still
remember
This
was
the
street
along
which
she
had
run
a
skinny
and
excited
ten-year-old
to
boast
to
her
father
that
she
was
the
only
girl
who
had
made
it
to
the
next
round
of
the
chess
competition
This
was
the
pavement
along
which
awkward
and
gawky
she
had
struggled
to
find
a
graceful
even
a
comfortable
way
of
carrying
her
cello
to
and
from
her
chamber
music
group
She
hesitated
at
the
corner
reluctant
almost
to
discover
that
she
was
now
as
of
this
moment
completely
lost
in
the
world
and
for
the
first
time
she
asked
herself
clearly
why
she
had
decided
to
come
here
This
was
not
home
Home
was
in
Peckham
in
the
shabby
house
whose
light
spilled
each
evening
out
onto
the
street
Family
was
Jim
and
the
others
family
was
her
women's
group
and
squabbling
at
two-thirty
in
the
morning
about
whether
women
could
be
said
to
constitute
a
separate
class
because
they
had
a
separate
relation
to
the
mode
of
production
while
still
making
each
other
coffee
and
giving
each
other
hugs
And
love
was
standing
outside
the
local
supermarket
collecting
signatures
for
the
campaign
to
keep
Family
Allowance
as
a
separate
benefit
She
had
forsaken
her
people
and
her
father's
house
and
had
like
every
other
well-brought-up
girl
established
her
own
household
and
she
should
cleave
only
unto
it
forsaking
all
others
so
long
as
she
should
live
She
did
not
know
why
she
had
come
Not
certainly
to
reassure
her
mother
but
to
boast
of
her
new
self!
To
show
off
And
then
the
moment
had
passed
and
tall
and
tanned
and
fit
in
the
sunshine
she
had
walked
down
the
green
street
with
the
gardens
either
side
of
her
and
had
known
by
an
instinctive
glance
that
her
mother
still
lived
there
that
nothing
had
changed
She
rang
the
doorbell
listened
to
the
silence
within
and
felt
a
moment
of
panic
Then
she
laughed
at
herself
with
an
edge
of
self-mocking
irony
All
her
self-righteousness
had
failed
to
inform
her
that
her
mother
a
hardy
professional
was
certainly
still
at
work
in
the
city
that
she
had
left
behind
her
They
had
probably
passed
each
other
on
the
road
She
went
back
to
the
corner
and
across
to
the
nearby
pub
where
she
sat
sipping
beer
munching
a
cheese
sandwich
and
waiting
She
had
waited
all
afternoon
later
sitting
in
the
garden
and
reading
When
the
sun
moved
round
she
too
had
moved
to
the
doorstep
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
concentrating
half
on
the
book
and
half
on
the
remembered
scene
until
her
mother
had
arrived
walking
up
the
street
where
they
had
both
walked
so
many
times
before
That
had
been
the
moment
of
her
undoing
Her
mother
had
got
older
fatter
and
sadder
Phoebe
felt
an
enormous
and
unwelcome
surge
of
pity
of
compassion
and
caring
and
with
it
guilt
In
one
swoop
the
feeling
swallowed
her
up
and
she
had
never
got
rid
of
it
since
She
saw
in
Rachel's
face
three
years
of
loss
and
loneliness
she
saw
too
the
simpler
anger
that
Rachel
would
never
dare
to
express
And
to
cover
up
the
dreadfulness
of
the
moment
the
pain
of
the
knowledge
that
Rachel
had
become
old
alone
and
friendless
she
had
giggled
and
said
something
about
having
lost
her
key
She
felt
the
deep
need
in
Rachel's
hug
and
responded
to
it
but
it
was
Rachel's
need
not
her
own
She
was
furious
Her
fury
made
her
aggressive
and
she
attacked
She
was
mean
and
horrible
to
her
mother
snide
self-righteous
and
unkind
Only
in
her
anger
could
she
drown
out
the
dark
shadow
that
pity
and
guilt
had
cast
over
her
She
hated
herself
for
it
and
went
on
and
on
convinced
that
her
only
defence
was
to
make
Rachel
throw
her
out
again
and
Rachel
refused
to
be
provoked
Finally
Rachel
responded
and
Phoebe
had
forgotten
in
her
wanderings
just
how
bloody
clever
Rachel
was
How
well
she
could
keep
control
and
use
words
and
manipulate
their
meanings
and
score
points
It
was
this
ruthless
clarity
and
brightness
that
she
had
run
away
from
She
Phoebe
told
herself
did
not
play
those
stupid
games
any
more
she
was
direct
and
straightforward
But
her
mouth
motored
on
and
what
came
out
was
simply
and
childishly
rude
Phoebe
felt
foolish
Rachel
seemed
able
to
absorb
everything
that
Phoebe
tried
She
was
calm
and
sweet
and
later
insisted
on
taking
Phoebe
out
to
dinner
at
some
fancy
little
pseudo-Bohemian
bistro
Then
to
her
final
and
total
humiliation
Phoebe
found
that
she
was
actually
having
a
good
time
she
was
enjoying
her
mother
and
her
mother's
easy
authority
and
charm
Her
mother
she
thought
with
a
most
annoying
pride
who
was
one
of
the
few
genuinely
creative
women
scientists
around
and
in
whose
success
were
it
anyone
except
her
mother's
she
would
be
rejoicing
She
went
to
bed
in
her
own
room
still
full
of
pictures
and
possessions
that
had
belonged
to
a
previous
and
vanished
Phoebe
She
curled
up
in
the
position
she
had
slept
in
as
a
child
and
realised
with
a
sinking
heart
that
it
was
not
only
the
most
comfortable
way
of
being
in
bed
but
it
was
also
one
that
you
could
not
adopt
in
company
She
thought
that
she
never
wanted
to
sleep
with
Jim
again
that
the
bonds
of
love
were
snares
and
that
she
must
at
all
costs
leave
as
early
as
possible
the
next
morning
and
never
come
back
She
had
a
clear
and
frightening
premonition
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
manage
it
Perhaps
if
she
had
not
got
pregnant
perhaps
they
could
have
pulled
it
off
Perhaps
not
Now
she
no
longer
knew
She
found
it
hard
to
remember
with
any
precision
exactly
what
had
happened
next
She
remembered
a
little
of
the
acrimony
of
the
mounting
bitterness
within
the
house
of
their
winter
of
discontent
which
was
so
much
part
of
and
not
part
of
the
winter
outside
and
the
miners
strike
But
the
light
no
longer
poured
out
of
their
house
and
onto
the
street
the
power
cuts
although
they
supported
them
passionately
cut
off
their
power
somewhere
Jim
and
Jonathan
especially
were
never
there
and
the
arguments
about
washing
up
versus
serving
the
revolution
lost
their
gaiety
and
became
mean-mouthed
Alan
and
Sue
moved
out
went
north
to
do
something
else
Phoebe
had
not
seen
Alan
since
though
Sue
had
moved
back
again
briefly
later
that
winter
saddened
and
distressed
by
Alan's
disaffection
She
had
been
part
of
a
long
stream
of
women
who
had
come
and
gone
swiftly
lives
collapsing
in
one
area
as
they
gained
power
and
certainty
in
another
Suddenly
there
were
too
many
women
realising
that
their
happiness
had
to
be
taken
at
the
expense
of
their
men's
men
who
had
promised
so
much
and
could
not
now
deliver
the
goods
just
like
her
father
five
years
before
Lisa
and
Phoebe
shared
the
painful
knowledge
that
they
had
been
conning
themselves
as
well
as
their
men
How
had
a
Conservative
Government
happened
Where
were
the
golden
days
which
Paris
and
Chicago
and
Grosvenor
Square
had
promised
them
In
the
meantime
the
miners
represented
hope
for
all
of
them
but
within
the
giddy
cycle
of
excitements
they
were
all
edgy
with
new
fears
and
old
illusions
After
Sue
and
Alan
left
Lisa
and
Phoebe
had
invited
their
neighbour
Jo
and
her
lover
Sophie
to
come
and
share
the
house
with
them
Jim
and
Jonathan
had
been
away
picketing
and
pamphleteering
in
Reading
had
simply
been
not
available
and
Jo's
squat
had
been
suddenly
repossessed
and
it
did
not
occur
to
any
of
the
women
that
the
boys
would
mind
Sophie
moreover
actually
had
a
job
had
an
income
which
was
beginning
to
be
something
of
a
pressing
issue
inflation
and
the
changing
climate
began
to
bite
into
their
indifferent
superiority
to
the
outside
world
and
they
had
given
no
thought
as
to
how
to
fight
that
Then
the
boys
as
it
turned
out
minded
bitterly
having
Jo
and
Sophie
Since
on
principle
they
could
not
say
that
lesbianism
made
them
nervous
and
that
the
complex
new
demands
made
on
them
scared
them
they
found
more
underhand
and
aggressive
ways
of
expressing
their
resentments
The
women
outnumbered
them
and
plotted
together
Having
the
other
two
women
in
the
house
taught
Lisa
something
new
about
herself
she
and
Jonathan
stopped
sleeping
together
which
left
them
all
short
of
space
Phoebe
felt
betrayed
by
Lisa's
desertion
She
and
Jim
talked
together
secretly
about
leaving
the
house
and
going
off
to
somewhere
more
committed
but
Phoebe
could
not
bring
herself
to
give
up
the
only
home
she
knew
of
could
not
bring
herself
to
choose
absolutely
Jim's
commitments
over
the
women's
commitments

had
just
turned
twenty-two
Creed
opened
the
glass
panel
one
morning
as
they
were
returning
from
the
airport
and
said
Where
do
you
live
Spaghetti
Mangrove
East
Creed
shook
his
head
I
need
you
closer
It
was
exactly
what
Jed
had
been
waiting
to
hear
but
he
kept
his
voice
level
Where've
you
got
in
mind
sir
The
Palace
Jed's
heart
lifted
in
his
ribs
The
Palace
was
where
Creed
lived
in
a
penthouse
suite
on
the
fourteenth
floor
so
the
idea
made
perfect
sense
But
the
Palace
was
also
the
most
exclusive
apartment
hotel
in
the
city
It
was
located
on
Ocean
Drive
between
C
and
D
it
took
up
the
entire
block
With
its
two
twin
towers
of
baroque
grey
stone
it
was
just
about
the
only
building
in
Moon
Beach
that
wasn't
either
white
or
pale-blue
Its
lobby
was
the
size
of
a
railway
station
all
peach
marble
and
glass
and
gilded
metal
The
central
chandelier
was
gold-plated
and
weighed
it
was
rumoured
something
in
the
region
of
half
a
ton
Everyone
had
stayed
at
the
Palace
Heads
of
state
movie-stars
tycoons
Just
to
be
able
to
give
it
as
your
address!
You'll
be
in
the
basement
Creed
said
but
it
should
be
adequate
He
allowed
himself
a
smile
It
can
hardly
fail
to
be
an
improvement
on
Mangrove
East
in
any
case
Jed
moved
that
same
week
To
reach
his
new
apartment
you
had
to
use
the
old
tradesmen's
entrance
past
the
service
elevator
down
four
flights
of
stairs
along
a
corridor
with
a
linoleum
floor
The
basement
of
the
Palace
was
a
lost
kingdom
of
storerooms
washrooms
and
boiler-rooms
Fat
grey
pipes
hugging
the
ceilings
dull
yellow
walls
The
air
smelt
of
lagging
paint
damp
And
also
ever
so
faintly
and
inexplicably
of
marzipan
In
the
end
you
came
to
a
door
that
said
and
this
was
equally
inexplicable
D
There
was
no
C
and
no
E
There
wasn't
even
a
A
D
was
unique
and
without
context
It
was
another
dimension
It
was
Jed's
new
home
There
were
two
rooms
both
painted
a
tired
pale-green
There
was
a
bed
a
TV
a
phone
There
was
air-conditioning
That
was
about
it
If
you
parted
the
net
curtains
and
peered
sideways
and
upwards
you
could
see
one
tiny
piece
of
bright
blue
sky
but
you
might
pull
a
muscle
doing
it
A
constant
clash
and
tinkle
came
from
the
kitchens
across
the
courtyard
like
the
percussion
section
of
an
orchestra
from
hell
At
night
the
boiler
took
over
roaring
and
trembling
until
dawn
During
his
first
week
in
the
Palace
he
hardly
slept
It
was
during
the
second
week
that
Carol
asked
him
to
dinner
at
her
parents
place
As
the
taxi
moved
down
off
the
harbour
bridge
and
into
the
suburb
of
Paradise
he
remembered
what
Vasco
had
said
and
turned
to
her
Your
father
he
said
is
he
really
the
chairman
Carol
looked
embarrassed
Yes
He
sat
back
Jesus
So
her
father
really
was
the
chairman
Her
father
was
Sir
Charles
Dobson
Why
Carol
said
Didn't
you
know
No
not
really
Vasco
said
something
about
it
but
I
didn't
believe
him
I
thought
everyone
knew
And
she
gave
him
a
smile
that
resembled
gratitude
It
was
as
if
in
not
knowing
he'd
paid
her
a
great
compliment
Sir
Charles
and
Lady
Dobson
lived
on
Pacific
Drive
a
road
that
wound
its
way
through
the
canyons
then
doubled
back
towards
the
ocean
to
link
eventually
with
the
South
Coast
Expressway
The
house
was
one
of
the
white
wedding-cake
mansions
in
the
block
high
wrought-iron
gates
and
video
security
and
just
the
hills
rising
in
silence
behind
Jed
paid
the
taxi
and
stood
still
You
needed
millions
to
breathe
this
air
This
air
exactly
right
here
Millions
And
suddenly
he
took
the
rumours
and
put
them
on
like
a
coat
Lifted
and
dropped
his
shoulders
a
few
times
he'd
seen
people
do
it
when
they
tried
on
clothes
in
stores
Not
a
bad
fit
Maybe
he
really
was
a
cunning
son
of
a
bitch
just
like
Vasco
said
he
was
Certainly
he
was
thinking
all
those
thoughts
Jed
Morgan
he
was
thinking
Chairman
Dinner
was
plate
after
plate
of
food
he'd
hardly
ever
set
eyes
on
let
alone
eaten
caviar
bortsch
salmon
duck
And
then
as
if
that
wasn't
indigestible
enough
the
conversation
turned
to
the
subject
of
advertising
The
new
Paradise
Corporation
commercial
had
just
aired
the
previous
night
Jed
had
seen
it
It
opened
with
a
black
screen
and
a
voice
that
said
This
is
probably
the
most
frightening
place
in
the
world
It
pulled
back
slowly
to
reveal
a
fringe
of
green
around
the
black
You
were
looking
into
an
open
grave
The
voice
went
on
to
say
that
when
you
were
faced
with
something
as
frightening
as
death
you
needed
the
right
people
around
you
and
the
right
people
were
the
Paradise
Corporation
etc
etc
One
of
the
papers
had
attacked
the
commercial
for
being
too
emotive
People
at
the
dinner
table
were
springing
to
the
commercial's
defence
using
words
like
honest
and
bold
Well
Jed
said
speaking
up
for
the
first
time
at
least
there
weren't
any
tolling
bells
in
it
All
the
talk
around
him
suddenly
subsided
he
felt
strangely
shipwrecked
in
the
silence
I
used
to
work
on
commercials
for
funeral
parlours
he
went
on
I
used
to
think
that
if
I
heard
one
more
tolling
bell
I'd
go
out
of
my
mind
After
the
laughter
had
died
away
he
told
a
story
about
one
particular
commercial
that
he'd
worked
on
It
was
a
testimonial
for
a
funeral
parlour
which
had
dealt
with
the
victims
of
a
forest
fire
He
needed
the
sound
of
a
forest
fire
running
under
the
voice-track
but
he
couldn't
find
the
effect
on
file
It
was
seven
at
night
and
the
commercial
had
to
be
presented
at
breakfast
the
next
day
In
the
end
he
had
no
choice
He
had
to
create
the
effect
himself
How
did
you
do
that
Lady
Dobson
asked
I'll
show
you
Jed
said
but
I
need
absolute
silence
Out
of
his
left
pocket
he
produced
a
handful
of
candy-wrappers
and
during
the
hush
that
followed
he
created
a
forest
fire
for
the
Dobsons
and
their
guests
in
the
Dobson's
very
own
dining-room
It
was
a
great
success
And
these
are
only
Liquorice
Whirls
he
said
In
those
days
I
was
eating
Almond
Toffee
Creams
and
they
came
in
much
cracklier
paper
Either
Sir
Charles
had
forgotten
what
Jed
did
or
else
nobody
had
bothered
to
tell
him
because
he
now
leaned
forwards
and
impressed
it
seemed
by
Jed's
ingenuity
and
verve
said
Perhaps
young
man
you
should
come
and
work
for
me
All
eyes
locked
on
Jed
He
waited
three
seconds
You
have
to
time
things
But
Sir
Charles
he
said
I
already
do
He
looked
round
People
were
weeping
with
laughter
He
caught
Carol's
eye
and
winked
His
skin
had
picked
up
a
glow
from
the
lilies
on
the
table
The
candlelight
had
taken
his
cheap
suit
and
made
it
over
in
some
priceless
fabric
The
vintage
wine
had
anointed
his
tongue
with
new
and
seductive
language
He
could
do
no
wrong
When
the
meal
was
over
Sir
Charles
escorted
him
into
the
library
He
watched
Sir
Charles
cut
the
tip
off
his
cigar
Being
old
had
done
something
to
Sir
Charles's
face
something
that
being
poor
sometimes
did
It
had
sucked
the
colour
out
Eyes
hair
skin
all
different
shades
of
grey
and
white
Distinguished
yes
But
colourless
And
cheeks
with
folds
in
them
like
old
wallets
He
wondered
how
much
Sir
Charles
was
worth
But
now
the
cigar
was
lit
and
turning
to
Jed
Sir
Charles
spoke
through
billowing
smoke
So
who
exactly
do
you
work
for
I
work
for
Mr
Creed
I'm
his
driver
Maybe
it
was
only
a
coincidence
but
as
soon
as
Jed
pronounced
the
name
of
his
employer
the
cigar
fell
from
Sir
Charles's
fingers
It
bounced
on
the
carpet
shedding
chunks
of
red-hot
ash
God-DAMN
Sir
Charles
spread
his
legs
and
stooped
He
flicked
the
ash
towards
the
fireplace
with
the
back
of
his
hand
Then
he
stuck
the
cigar
between
his
teeth
and
slowly
sucked
the
life
back
into
it
Let
me
ask
you
something
Jed
he
said
when
the
smoke
was
billowing
once
more
Have
you
ever
been
to
head
office
I
have
yes
What
did
you
think
of
it
The
head
office
of
the
Paradise
Corporation
as
Sir
Charles
knew
perfectly
well
was
just
about
the
most
famous
building
in
the
city
Built
entirely
of
black
glass
it
marked
the
beginning
of
what
was
known
as
Death
Row
a
stretch
of
downtown
First
Avenue
where
most
of
the
big
funeral
parlours
had
their
offices
All
night
long
lights
burned
in
the
central
elevator
shaft
and
in
the
windows
of
the
twenty-fifth
floor
The
result
was
a
white
cross
that
stood
out
among
the
familiar
neon
logos
of
airlines
and
oil
companies
The
cross
was
a
landmark
You
could
even
buy
postcards
of
it
Jed
had
only
been
inside
the
building
once
and
all
he
could
remember
was
the
angel
She
was
part
sculpture
part
fountain
Her
head
and
body
were
metal
and
her
wings
were
water
water
that
was
forced
through
holes
in
her
back
and
lit
from
beneath
so
it
looked
solid
like
glass
He
remembered
the
hiss
of
those
wings
the
lick
and
swish
of
revolving
doors
the
warble
of
phones
All
tricks
a
hypnotist
might
use
Forget
your
loss
Forget
your
grief
He
remembered
drifting
drifting
close
to
sleep
You
walk
into
that
building
Sir
Charles
said
and
you
know
you're
in
capable
hands
Clouds
of
smoke
trailed
over
his
shoulder
as
he
paced
You've
got
to
win
people's
trust
Trust
is
very
important
Without
trust
and
he
came
to
a
standstill
and
tipped
his
chin
into
the
air
the
thought
still
forming
Without
trust
Jed
said
we
wouldn't
be
standing
here
now
Sir
Charles
swung
round
Precisely
For
a
moment
he
was
rendered
motionless
by
surprise
a
kind
of
respect
But
only
for
a
moment
What
I'm
trying
to
say
to
you
is
this
is
a
hard
business
A
cut
throat
business
at
times
But
you
should
always
remember
one
thing
It's
people
that
you're
dealing
with
People
He
thrust
both
hands
in
his
pockets
and
rocked
back
on
his
heels
I'm
sixty-nine
and
I'm
still
working
Nobody
really
retires
from
this
business
It's
a
way
of
life
He
showed
Jed
to
the
door
of
the
library
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you
my
boy
Not
that
I
can
think
of
Then
his
face
moved
close
to
Jed's
and
he
said
Are
you
interested
in
my
daughter
I'll
let
you
into
a
secret
Sir
Charles
Jed
said
I'm
not
interested
in
your
daughter
at
all
I'm
just
pretending
to
be
It's
your
money
I'm
really
after
Sir
Charles
stared
at
Jed
and
Jed
stared
back
he
wasn't
going
to
help
Dobson
out
with
this
one
At
last
a
smile
began
to
pull
at
the
folds
in
Sir
Charles's
face
as
if
his
cheeks
really
were
wallets
and
his
smile
was
going
through
them
looking
for
cash
then
the
smile
turned
to
laughter
it
pushed
between
his
teeth
it
was
dry
and
rhythmic
it
sounded
uncannily
like
someone
counting
a
stack
of
dollar
bills
Jed
saw
Carol
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
began
to
walk
towards
her
You
remember
what
I
said
Sir
Charles
called
after
him
The
next
day
Creed
asked
Jed
to
drive
him
out
to
the
Crumbles
The
Crumbles
lay
to
the
east
of
the
city
All
the
land
out
there
had
been
under
water
once
It
was
flat
for
miles
There
were
a
few
wooden
beach
huts
down
by
the
shoreline
Some
old
mine
buildings
in
the
distance
some
gravel
pits
Otherwise
just
shingle
grey
and
orange
and
a
soft
wind
tugging
at
the
heads
of
weeds
He
followed
Creed's
directions
leaving
the
road
for
an
unpaved
track
that
seemed
to
lead
towards
the
ocean
The
track
widened
and
then
vanished
Then
they
were
driving
over
rough
ground
loose
stones
popping
under
the
tyres
He
parked
close
to
where
the
land
sloped
downwards
to
a
narrow
pebble
beach
and
switched
the
engine
off
Creed
stared
out
of
the
window
his
chin
cushioned
on
one
hand
his
eyes
doubly
concealed
first
by
the
tinted
windows
of
the
car
then
by
his
sunglasses
Jed
thought
he
understood
It
was
like
Vasco
and
the
mudbanks
of
the
river
It
was
where
Creed
came
to
do
his
thinking
Where
was
Vasco
Jed
wondered
He'd
scarcely
set
eyes
on
him
since
the
night
they'd
had
dinner
together
at
the
house
in
Westwood
Nobody
had
mentioned
him
either
and
Jed
didn't
feel
he
should
ask
He
poured
himself
a
cup
of
coffee
from
his
private
flask
and
watched
the
white
gulls
lift
and
scatter
against
the
dull
grey
sky
The
glass
panel
slid
open
behind
him
I
heard
you
were
out
at
Dobson's
place
last
night
That's
right
sir
I
was
He'd
known
Creed
would
find
out
He'd
even
wanted
him
to
He
wanted
Creed
to
be
amused
impressed
even
A
chauffeur
at
the
chairman's
dinner
table!
Any
particular
reason
Carol
asked
me
Carol
His
daughter
The
receptionist
Creed
said
nothing
The
one
with
the
limp
Jed
said
I
know
the
one
Another
silence
Wind
pushed
at
the
car
Then
Creed
said
Dobson's
on
his
way
out
The
chairman
On
his
way
out
But
Creed
didn't
give
Jed
time
to
think
When
a
ship
sinks
he
said
that's
when
you
see
who
the
rats
are
What
interests
me
is
which
rats
leave
which
ship
The
glass
panel
slid
shut
One
week
later
Sir
Charles
Dobson
resigned
as
chairman
of
the
Paradise
Corporation
The
decision
had
been
taken
the
statement
said
for
personal
reasons
The
new
chairman
elected
unanimously
by
the
members
of
the
board
was
Mr
Neville
Creed
Jed
read
the
statement
three
times
while
he
was
eating
breakfast
that
morning
It
sounded
calm
and
measured
utterly
reasonable
But
he
couldn't
make
any
sense
of
it
He
saw
Dobson
standing
in
the
library
Nobody
really
retires
from
this
business
It's
a
way
of
life
He
couldn't
make
any
sense
of
it
at
all
And
then
he
saw
Creed
sitting
in
the
back
of
a
black
car
parked
on
the
Crumbles
Dobson's
on
his
way
out

His
weapon
against
the
rusty
binding
of
the
bolt
was
a
fifty
kopeck
coin
For
more
than
an
hour
he
had
crouched
on
the
floor
bracing
himself
as
the
speed
changes
of
the
train
and
the
unevenness
of
the
track
destroyed
the
momentum
of
his
painstaking
work
With
the
milled
edge
of
the
coin
he
chipped
at
the
red-brown
crust
that
had
formed
between
the
lower
lip
of
the
cap
of
the
bolt
and
the
metal
sheet
plate
of
the
carriage
flooring
He
had
something
to
show
for
his
effort
A
tiny
pile
of
dust
debris
was
collected
beside
his
knee
and
some
had
stained
the
material
of
his
grey
trousers

him
at
the
factory
on
the
Kent
fringes
of
London
might
not
now
have
recognized
their
man
A
year
in
the
gaols
had
left
its
mark
The
full
flesh
of
his
cheeks
and
chin
had
been
scalped
back
to
the
bone
A
bright
confidence
at
his
eyes
had
been
replaced
by
something
harsher
Clothes
that
had
hung
well
now
fell
shapelessly
like
charity
hand-outs
A
ruddiness
in
his
face
had
given
way
to
a
pallor
that
was
unmistakably
the
work
of
the
cells
His
full
dark
hair
had
been
cropped
in
the
barber's
chair
of
the
holding
prison
to
a
brush
without
lustre
This
was
an
old
carriage
but
still
well
capable
of
performing
the
task
set
for
it
when
it
had
first
joined
the
rolling-stock
in
the
year
that
Holly
had
been
born
It
had
carried
many
on
this
journey
It
had
brought
them
in
their
hundreds
in
their
thousands
in
their
tens
of
thousands
along
this
track
It
was
a
carriage
of
the
prison
train
that
ran
twice
weekly
from
the
capital
city
to
the
interior
depths
of
the
Autonomous
Soviet
Socialist
Republic
of
Mordovia
On
the
floor
in
the
filth
and
the
watery
amber
half-light
he
scraped
at
the
bolt
that
had
felt
the
boots
and
slippers
and
sandals
of
the
prisoners
who
had
encompassed
his
life
time
Not
easy
to
prise
at
the
rim
of
the
bolt
because
this
was
a
purpose-built
carriage
No
ordinary
carriage
not
subject
to
any
hasty
conversion
to
ensure
its
usefulness
but
out
of
the
railway
factory
yards
of
Leningrad
and
designed
only
for
transporting
the
prisoners
A
walkway
for
the
guards
and
compartments
to
separate
the
convicts
into
manageable
groups
each
fitted
with
small
hatches
for
the
dropping
of
their
black
bread
rations
and
unmoveable
benches
and
shelves
for
a
few
to
sleep
on
The
carriages
had
their
name
The
Stolypin
carriage
carried
the
name
of
the
Tsarist
minister
struck
down
by
an
assassin
seventy
years
before
The
new
men
of
the
Kremlin
were
not
above
the
simplicity
of
taking
a
former
idea
and
adapting
it
to
their
needs
The
walls
the
bars
the
bolts
and
the
locks
remained
only
the
prisoners
of
the
regime
had
changed
They
had
brought
Holly
by
car
from
the
Lefortovo
gaol
to
the
train
while
Muscovites
still
slept
He
had
barely
slept
after
the
meeting
with
the
Consul
from
the
Embassy
and
the
escort
of
men
in
the
khaki
uniforms
of
the
Komitet
Gosudarstvennoi
Bezopasnosti
had
taken
him
still
drowsy
from
the
back
seat
to
the
train
at
a
far
platform
The
one
who
wore
on
his
blue
shoulder
flash
the
insignia
of
major's
rank
had
shaken
his
hand
and
grinned
a
supercilious
smile
Into
the
carriage
the
door
slammed
the
bolt
across
the
key
turned
Two
other
men
for
company
Perhaps
they
had
been
loaded
on
the
train
many
hours
before
Holly
because
they
seemed
to
him
to
be
sleeping
when
he
had
first
seen
them
in
the
darkened
carriage
He
had
not
spoken
then
they
had
not
spoken
since
A
barrier
existed
between
them
But
they
watched
him
All
through
the
morning
as
they
sat
on
the
makeshift
bunks
they
stared
without
comment
at
the
kneeling
figure
who
ground
away
at
the
rust
around
the
bolt
The
work
at
the
bolt
mindless
and
persistent
allowed
the
thoughts
of
Michael
Holly
to
flow
unfettered
The
week
before
had
stretched
the
distance
of
a
lifetime
And
the
lifetime
had
ended
in
a
death
and
death
was
the
carriage
that
rolled
shaking
and
relentless
towards
the
East
Where
to
go
back
to
where
to
find
the
birth
Months
weeks
days
how
far
to
go
back
The
coin
had
found
the
central
stem
of
the
bolt
the
rust
shell
was
dispersed
The
bolt
was
not
strong
arthritic
with
age
and
corrosion
How
far
to
go
back
Not
the
childhood
not
the
parentage
that
was
a
different
story
that
was
not
the
work
of
the
last
crowded
hours
Forget
the
origins
of
the
man
What
of
Millet
Complacent
plausible
Millet
But
neither
was
Millet
a
part
of
these
last
days
nor
was
the
journey
to
Moscow
nor
the
rendezvous
that
was
aborted
nor
the
arrest
and
the
trial
Millet
had
a
place
in
the
history
of
the
affair
but
that
place
was
not
in
its
present
not
in
its
future
Where
did
the
present
begin
Michael
Holly
now
on
his
knees
on
a
Stolypin
carriage
floor
and
unshaven
because
they
would
not
permit
him
a
razor
and
with
the
hunger
lapping
at
his
belly
had
been
a
model
prisoner
in
the
Vladimir
gaol/200
kilometres
east
of
the
capital
A
foreigner
and
housed
on
the
second
floor
of
the
hospital
block
in
the
cell
that
it
was
said
had
held
the
pilot
Gary
Powers
and
the
businessman
Greville
Wynne
Down
for
espionage
given
fifteen
years
by
the
courts
Everyone
from
the
governor
to
the
humblest
creeping
trustie
knew
that
Michael
Holly
would
serve
only
a
minimal
proportion
of
those
fifteen
years
There
was
a
man
in
England
there
would
be
an
exchange
So
they
gave
him
milk
they
gave
him
books
to
read
they
allowed
food
parcels
from
the
Embassy
They
waited
and
Michael
Holly
waited
for
the
arrangements
to
be
made
The
Political
Officer
at
Vladimir
said
that
it
would
not
be
too
long
and
the
interrogations
had
been
courteous
and
the
warders
had
been
correct
When
they
had
taken
him
from
the
hospital
block
with
his
possessions
and
spare
clothes
in
a
cloth
sack
he
had
smiled
and
shaken
hands
and
believed
that
the
flight
was
close
Berlin
he
had
thought
it
would
be
In
Lefortovo
holding
prison
he
had
learned
the
truth
across
a
bare
scrubbed
table
from
the
Consul
sent
by
the
Embassy
An
obsequious
little
man
the
Consul
had
been
crushed
by
the
message
that
he
brought
The
Consul
had
stumbled
through
his
speech
and
Holly
had
listened
It's
not
that
it's
anyone's
fault
Mr
Holly
you
mustn't
think
that
It's
just
terribly
bad
luck
it's
the
worst
luck
I've
heard
of
since
I've
been
here
that's
eight
years
It
was
all
set
up
well
you
know
that
People
had
worked
very
hard
on
this
matter
you
really
have
to
believe
that
Well
we
can't
deliver
That's
what
it's
all
about
now
A
swap
is
a
swap
one
man
to
be
exchanged
for
another
It
was
you
and
this
fellow
and
we
can't
deliver
I'm
dreadfully
sorry
Mr
Holly
it's
the
most
extraordinary
thing
but
the
chap's
dead
snuffed
it
He
had
the
best
medical
treatment
well
you'll
not
be
interested
in
that
The
bolt
shifted
Holly
strained
with
his
fingers
to
twist
the
coin
under
the
lip
of
the
bolt
The
bolt
had
moved
a
millimetre
perhaps
two
But
I
can
assure
you
that
people
back
in
London
were
really
most
upset
at
this
development
I'm
afraid
the
Soviets
are
going
to
take
rather
a
hard
line
with
you
now
Mr
Holly
There's
no
point
in
my
not
being
frank
The
Foreign
Ministry
informs
us
now
that
since
your
parents
were
both
born
Soviet
citizens
under
Soviet
law
you
are
a
Soviet
citizen
also
I
know
Mr
Holly
you
were
born
in
the
United
Kingdom
you
were
brought
up
there
you
were
in
possession
of
a
valid
British
passport
when
you
travelled
to
Moscow
The
Soviets
are
going
to
disregard
all
that
We've
had
a
hell
of
a
job
getting
this
degree
of
consular
access
I
want
you
to
know
that
We
said
they
couldn't
have
the
corpse
if
we
didn't
get
it
that's
by
the
by
but
it's
understood
by
both
sides
that
this
is
the
last
of
such
meetings
You're
being
transferred
to
the
Correctional
Labour
Colonies
but
you
won't
be
classified
as
a
foreigner
you
won't
be
in
the
foreigners
camp
They're
going
to
take
you
beyond
our
reach
Mr
Holly
you've
always
proclaimed
your
innocence
of
the
charges
and
accusations
made
against
you
From
our
side
the
Foreign
and
Commonwealth
Office
have
been
very
firm
too
You
are
innocent
as
far
as
Her
Majesty's
Government
is
concerned
We're
not
wavering
from
that
position
You
understand
that
Mr
Holly
We
deny
absolutely
that
you
were
involved
in
any
nonsensical
espionage
adventure
It's
very
important
that
we
continue
to
take
that
line
you
can
see
that
I'm
sure
Mr
Holly
the
British
government
knows
that
you
have
supported
your
parents
most
generously
during
their
retirement
Your
parents
will
not
be
abandoned
by
us
Mr
Holly
just
as
we
will
not
abandon
the
stance
that
you
were
completely
innocent
of
trumped-up
charges
You
do
understand
me
Mr
Holly
The
bolt
rose
a
centimetre
There
was
a
dribble
of
sweat
at
Holly's
forehead
Too
much
space
now
for
the
coin
to
be
useful
his
finger
could
slide
under
the
lip
The
rough
metal
edge
cut
into
his
finger
tip
An
eddy
of
chill
air
swirled
into
the
carriage
fastening
on
his
knuckles
He
heard
louder
than
before
the
dripping
clatter
of
the
wheels
on
the
rails
beneath
him
Look
Mr
Holly
I've
painted
the
picture
black
because
that's
the
only
honest
thing
to
do
We'll
keep
trying
of
course
that
goes
without
saying
but
in
the
present
climate
of
relations
there's
little
chance
of
your
situation
altering
dramatically
You'll
be
going
to
the
camps
and
you
have
to
come
to
terms
with
that
What
I'm
saying
is
well
you
have
to
learn
to
live
in
those
places
Mr
Holly
Try
and
survive
try
and
live
with
the
system
Don't
kick
it
don't
fight
it
You
can't
beat
them
I've
lived
here
long
enough
to
know
In
a
few
years
things
may
change
I
can't
promise
that
but
they
may
And
you
have
my
word
that
you
won't
be
forgotten
not
by
Whitehall
not
by
Foreign
and
Commonwealth
It's
going
to
boil
down
to
keeping
your
pecker
up
looking
on
the
best
side
of
things
You'll
do
that
won't
you
old
chap
There's
not
really
anything
more
for
me
to
say
Only
I
suppose
Good
Luck
That
was
what
the
present
had
on
offer
to
Michael
Holly
A
furtive
junior
diplomat
bowing
and
scraping
his
way
out
of
the
interview
section
of
the
Lefortovo
ogling
the
KGB
man
and
thanking
him
for
a
fifteen-minute
access
to
a
prisoner
for
whom
the
key
was
now
thrown
far
away
Forget
the
present
Holly
reckon
on
the
future
The
future
is
a
plate
of
steel
floor
covering
that
creaks
and
whistles
as
it
is
dragged
clear
of
the
supports
to
which
it
was
bolted
down
thirty
years
before
That's
the
future
Holly
A
steel
plate
above
the
stone
chippings
and
wood
sleepers
that
mark
the
track
from
Moscow
to
the
East
through
Kolomna
and
Ryazan
and
Spassk-Ryazanski
The
chippings
are
coated
in
fine
snow
and
the
cold
blusters
into
the
carriage
through
the
draught
gap
Behind
him
the
men
swore
softly
breaking
their
silence
The
train
was
not
running
fast
He
could
sense
the
strain
of
the
engine
far
to
the
front
There
was
a
dawdle
in
its
pace
and
there
had
been
times
when
it
had
halted
completely
other
times
when
it
had
slowed
to
a
crawl
The
daylight
was
fleeing
from
the
wilderness
that
he
could
not
see
but
whose
emptiness
beyond
the
shuttered
windows
he
understood
Barely
audible
above
the
new-found
noise
of
the
wheels
he
heard
the
sharp
step
of
feet
in
the
corridor
and
close
to
the
door
of
their
compartment
There
was
the
flap
of
the
food
hatch
swinging
on
its
hinge
one
door
away
from
his
Holly
pushed
the
steel
plate
down
eased
the
bolt
back
into
its
socket
with
his
toe
The
flap
of
the
door
flipped
jauntily
upward
A
sneering
face
gazed
at
the
caged
men
Three
brown
paper
bags
were
pushed
through
the
hatch
to
tumble
to
the
carriage
floor
The
flap
fell
back
The
two
men
moved
at
stoat's
speed
past
Holly
One
bag
into
the
hand
of
the
man
who
was
gross
and
white-skinned
a
second
for
the
man
with
the
beard
For
a
fleeting
moment
he
braced
himself
for
confrontation
suspecting
that
they
would
want
all
three
bags
but
they
left
him
his
They
darted
back
to
their
bunk
and
behind
him
was
the
sound
of
ripping
paper
Animals...poor
bastards
pitiful
creatures
But
then
at
Vladimir
Holly
had
been
segregated
from
the
mass
of
the
zeks
the
convicts
who
formed
the
greatest
part
of
the
prison
population
At
Vladimir
Holly
had
been
categorized
as
a
foreigner
he
had
been
on
the
second
floor
of
the
hospital
block
and
allowed
special
food
and
privileges
There
was
nothing
special
for
these
men
These
were
the
zeks
they
might
be
killers
or
thieves
or
rapists
or
parasites
or
hooligans
At
Vladimir
Holly
had
been
different
from
these
men
But
not
any
longer
The
stammered
words
of
the
Consul
flooded
back
to
him
He
was
to
be
classified
as
a
Soviet
citizen
he
was
being
sent
to
the
Correctional
Labour
Colonies
Try
and
live
with
the
system
don't
kick
it
and
don't
fight
it
you
can't
beat
them
You'll
hear
of
me
you
bastard
you'll
hear
of

Riborg
L
The
British
X
unknown
At
twelve
Jane
was
taken
to
England
to
be
educated
and
encountered
her
indelible
railway
wagon
The
school
was
large
and
famous
and
she
hated
the
institutionalised
life
but
what
to
do
If
she
ran
away
she
would
only
cause
worry
to
her
parents
and
anyway
where
could
she
run
to
on
this
island
She
was
brainy
except
for
maths
but
was
blessed
with
a
maths
mistress
of
infinite
patience
called
Miss
Walden
who
gave
her
extra
lessons
Jane
would
never
forget
her
unselfish
devotion
Jane
was
not
popular
in
order
to
be
popular
you
had
to
be
good
at
games
and
Jane
was
useless
at
all
of
them
and
they
played
everything
netball
rounders
tennis
lacrosse
hockey
even
cricket
every
afternoon
rain
or
shine
exams
or
no
exams
In
cricket
they
used
to
put
her
at
long
leg
where
the
ball
hardly
ever
penetrated
and
she
would
take
a
book
and
lie
down
to
read
in
the
long
grass
Then
on
the
rare
occasion
that
the
ball
did
come
of
course
she
missed
it
She
loved
the
country
surrounding
the
school
however
The
South
Downs
with
the
short
springy
turf
decorated
with
harebells
and
scabious
and
the
deceptively
gentle
slopes
the
horizon
constantly
moving
ahead
of
you
as
you
puffed
after
it
And
then
at
last
the
summit
with
the
cloud
shadows
scudding
across
the
huge
curved
expanse
and
a
band
of
sea
which
was
always
surprisingly
broad
and
above
the
sea
the
line
of
the
Downs
so
noble
and
so
bare
In
those
days
she
had
likened
the
climb
to
life
she
had
dared
to
hope
that
there
might
be
wonderful
things
over
the
horizon
Now
she
knew
that
there
was
probably
nothing
on
the
other
side
It
might
be
quite
bare
But
it
was
still
imperative
to
look
to
the
horizon
hopefully
or
quit
The
Sussex
coast
was
best
seen
at
a
distance
though
for
proximity
to
the
sea
causes
human
beings
to
create
great
ugliness
India
certainly
got
its
own
back
for
the
British
Raj
by
imposing
this
horrific
version
of
the
bungalow
upon
us
Still
as
Jane
belonged
nowhere
Sussex
became
the
nearest
thing
to
home
Then
suddenly
just
before
the
exams
she
became
popular
and
was
at
a
loss
to
know
why
A
kind
serene
girl
called
June
told
her
the
reason
June
was
one
of
those
characters
who
don't
develop
At
fourteen
or
forty
they
are
constant
dependable
consistently
dispensing
happiness
wherever
they
go
It's
because
you
and
Irene
are
the
cleverest
she
explained
And
they
want
you
to
come
top
But
why
asked
Jane
who
was
totally
non-competitive
Because
Irene's
Jewish
For
the
first
time
Jane
became
aware
of
anti-Semitism
and
it
horrified
her
She
remembered
her
father's
good-humoured
jokes
about
his
Jewish
friend
but
this
was
different
evil
It
made
her
want
to
escape
from
the
world
From
then
on
she
discovered
many
things
about
the
human
race
but
could
find
no
explanations
for
them
She
did
come
top
though
she
did
not
try
and
hoped
she
wouldn't
The
congratulations
sickened
her
The
headmistress
who
had
always
ridiculed
her
for
being
bad
at
games
now
referred
to
her
as
our
best
pupil
and
gave
her
a
set
of
Shakespeare
duly
inscribed
University
was
better
less
claustrophobic
more
cosmopolitan
There
were
undisciplined
Welsh
well-mannered
Iraquis
English
slobs
beautiful
Norwegians
One
of
the
Norwegian
girls
Riborg
was
the
daughter
of
a
ship
owner
but
had
attended
a
folk
high
school
along
with
children
whose
parents
were
cobblers
and
other
manual
labourers
How
much
more
civilised
Jane
thought
than
her
own
segregated
education
Riborg
approved
of
the
Iraquis
because
they
wore
clean
shirts
every
day
but
disapproved
of
the
Welsh
because
they
were
dirty
and
noisy
and
went
round
in
droves
They
have
no
dignity
and
no
manners
she
observed
severely
Once
at
school
the
girls
had
amused
themselves
by
putting
together
the
perfect
woman
and
Jane
had
been
surprised
when
they
chose
her
eyes
which
were
large
and
brown
She
had
always
hankered
to
be
tall
and
fair
like
Riborg
Riborg
showed
her
a
photograph
album
with
herself
by
a
fjord
in
a
miniscule
bikini
What
do
you
think
of
me
appearing
like
that
in
front
of
the
men
she
asked
in
her
slow
earnest
Germanic
accent
gazing
at
Jane
with
steady
blue
eyes
Then
answered
her
own
question
You
see
Norwegian
men
are
very
slow
They
need
to
drink
very
much
spirits
to
get
them
going!
Jane
had
a
fleeting
affair
with
a
tall
rangy
Scottish
lecturer
whose
main
pleasure
was
to
walk
for
miles
Sometimes
she
went
with
him
but
found
it
hard
to
keep
up
Later
she
met
his
wife
a
flirtatious
self-centred
Latvian
whom
she
was
sure
must
be
a
Gemini
She
told
Jane
laughing
Hamish
was
a
lecturer
at
Riga
University
and
we
were
all
determined
to
marry
him
to
get
out
of
Latvia
And
I
won!
It
was
because
I
sat
at
his
feet
with
my
blouse
undone
Jane
understood
then
why
Hamish
was
so
lonely
and
sad
Latvia's
loss
had
not
been
his
or
Britain's
gain
The
same
goes
for
certain
other
immigrants
such
as
newspaper
proprietors
Shortly
afterwards
Jane
went
to
a
friend's
house
in
Kensington
to
a
musical
party
where
a
famous
quartet
was
playing
and
sitting
on
the
stairs
talked
to
someone
whom
she
took
to
be
one
of
the
players
He
turned
out
to
be
a
friend
of
the
musicians
and
within
a
year
she
was
launched
on
her
disastrous
marriage
She
too
had
found
her
immigrant
In
the
difficult
job
of
getting
through
one's
life
happily
she
had
made
a
bad
start
Not
all
bad
though
It
brought
her
four
children
who
opened
up
the
world
for
her
and
unlocked
her
own
narrow
viewpoint
though
not
enough
as
events
were
to
show
And
it
introduced
her
to
Budapest
a
jewel
of
a
city
It
was
as
if
some
artistic
giant
at
the
making
of
the
world
had
arranged
it
with
the
perfect
placing
of
Buda
Hill
in
a
curve
of
the
Danube
on
an
otherwise
flat
landscape
The
spectacular
Danube!
Yet
Karl
Marx
probably
never
saw
it
He
had
picnics
on
Hampstead
Heath
And
despite
everything
the
citizens
of
Budapest
knew
how
to
live
Not
like
Londoners
rushing
home
to
their
dormitories
They
enjoyed
their
city
as
the
eighteenth-century
Londoners
must
have
done
before
the
delightful
town
houses
had
been
raped
and
turned
into
offices
In
Budapest
they
still
strolled
around
for
the
sheer
pleasure
of
it
They
played
chess
on
the
park
benches
and
on
Buda
Hill
there
was
a
mega-chessboard
with
the
men
almost
human
size
Their
humour
did
not
consist
of
mere
jokes
though
they
could
make
those
too
but
in
their
whole
attitude
to
life
as
the
violin
runs
through
the
Benedictus
of
the
Missa
Solemnis
like
a
golden
thread
from
which
all
else
rises
and
falls
an
unforced
humour
which
has
known
tragedy
and
learnt
to
surmount
it
Jane
saw
it
in
the
smallest
things
all
impossible
in
self-conscious
Britain
At
dinner
in
the
garden
one
evening
for
instance
two
perfectly
ordinary
businessmen
suddenly
burst
into
a
Verdi
duet
Her
host
Laszlo
an
ex-accountant
used
to
take
action
directe
by
tossing
down
the
remains
from
his
dinner
plate
of
fish
to
the
cats
waiting
beneath
the
balcony
Another
day
there
was
an
impromptu
competition
between
Laszlo
his
wife
and
mother
to
see
who
could
crack
most
eggs
between
their
knees
an
extraordinarily
difficult
feat
to
achieve
Laszlo
was
indominately
trying
to
learn
English
and
when
Jane
saw
him
again
ten
years
later
he
had
still
not
progressed
beyond
the
first
book
now
old
and
tattered
Then
there
was
Rubletsky
an
old
friend
of
the
family
a
true
Bohemian
of
the
old
school
and
still
at
eighty
with
as
sure
a
touch
in
his
sculpture
and
drawings
as
ever
Titian
had
He
was
the
complete
unashamed
opportunist
with
immense
charm
and
took
nothing
seriously
except
his
art
He
completely
changed
when
he
was
working
When
at
play
Jane
watched
him
with
delight
as
he
rolled
about
on
the
floor
with
mirth
at
the
English
W
Despite
an
indigestible
plethora
of
consonants
in
the
Hungarian
language
they
have
no
W
Zee
shop
how
you
call
eet
Woll
wort!
He
shrieked
with
uncontrollable
glee
He
was
a
spare
aquiline
man
who
had
once
been
court
sculptor
and
perhaps
unofficial
jester!
to
a
mythical-sounding
King
Zog
Nevertheless
the
Communist
government
had
awarded
him
a
life
pension
so
he
had
no
worries
In
the
summer
he
lived
in
a
little
house
surrounded
by
sunflowers
higher
than
it
was
beside
a
village
with
a
pale
blue
pump
in
the
centre
with
geese
marching
around
pigeons
gurgling
they
have
a
different
accent
on
the
Continent
and
people
sitting
on
walls
gossiping
in
the
evening
Coming
back
to
England
from
one
of
these
school-holiday
visits
to
Hungary
Jane
was
more
than
ever
struck
by
the
contrast
Was
this
the
land
of
Shakespeare
with
his
spontaneous
carnival
of
images
What
had
gone
wrong
and
when
With
all
their
virtues
and
even
perhaps
especially
when
they
were
trying
to
enjoy
themselves
they
were
stiff
awkward
and
apologetic
At
New
Year
compare
the
joyous
skating
in
Moscow
the
balletic
conducting
of
Carlos
Kleiber
in
Vienna
whose
grace
shone
through
his
shapeless
suit!
with
the
Trafalgar
Square
mob!
Britain
had
no
style
though
it
once
had
Who
had
killed
it
Had
it
been
Cromwell
Perhaps
The
Restoration
lacked
the
spontaneity
of
the
Elizabethan
age
But
no
she
was
sure
it
was
Queen
Victoria
personally
who
had
spread
this
grey
fog
over
Britain
from
which
we've
never
recovered
Great
Victorians
like
Trollope
and
the
Pre-Raphaelites
had
been
fully
aware
of
what
was
happening
Perhaps
Jane
mused
we
should
never
get
over
it
The
despair
in
the
air
was
particularly
dense
at
the
present
time
though
its
monetarist
perpetrators
were
now
fighting
a
rearguard
action
against
the
rest
of
Europe
But
hopelessness
like
the
class
system
had
now
become
so
ingrained
in
the
soul
she
feared
that
it
could
be
removed
neither
by
stimuli
nor
legislation
The
English
character
puzzled
her
so
must
totally
confuse
foreigners
You
never
know
what
the
English
are
thinking
because
they're
always
so
polite
Riborg
had
told
her
You
don't
say
no
but
I
will
if
I
can
But
tiny
Britain
uniquely
among
countries
is
many
nations
We
have
to
watch
television
to
see
how
the
others
live
And
the
weather
from
one
part
of
this
diminutive
island
to
another
is
as
varied
as
the
people
There
are
some
general
characteristics
however
We
are
docile
and
lethargic
and
much
easier
to
govern
than
the
French
We
let
off
steam
in
graffiti
vandalism
and
football
hooliganism
Again
unlike
the
French
we
are
guilt-ridden
That's
why
we
say
sorry
so
often
And
we
do
not
take
ourselves
seriously
like
the
French
we
can
demolish
everything
with
our
humour
We've
got
a
wider
lunatic
fringe
than
other
nations
We're
an
odd
mixture
of
tolerance
and
prejudice
of
the
apologetic
and
the
arrogant
Nobody
understands
us
we
don't
even
understand
ourselves
But
we
are
fascinated
by
ourselves
which
is
why
Jane's
thoughts
rabbited
on
so
long
about
her
country
After
the
glimpse
of
Scandinavia
through
Riborg
and
later
the
experience
of
Hungary
Jane
was
so
far
carried
away
by
her
enthusiasm
for
classless
freedom
the
beauty
of
northern
landscapes
plus
the
humorous
awareness
of
the
central
European
people
that
when
a
Finn
crossed
her
path
she
was
fair
game
A
Finn
represented
the
fusion
of
Scandinavia
and
Hungary
to
which
country
they
were
first
cousins
so
no
doubt
she
expected
too
much
of
Erkki
Anyway
he
looked
like
an
ageing
Nordic
god
He
invited
her
to
lunch
at
his
club
for
international
journalists
in
Carlton
House
Terrace
They
went
to
hear
the
Sibelius
Violin
Concerto
superlatively
played
by
Isaac
Stern
But
then
slowly
unwillingly
she
had
to
admit
that
he
was
cold
and
conventional
and
his
lovemaking
was
nasty
brutish
and
short
A
sheep
in
wolf's
clothing
A
timid
pathetic
creature
disguised
by
a
big
manly
body
Outers
can
be
so
misleading!
The
vistas
of
fir
forests
islands
and
lakes
disintegrated
into
an
outer
London
suburb
and
a
mundane
wife
called
Letitia
She
was
he
said
bad-tempered
a
snob
and
he
seemed
afraid
of
her
she
had
obviously
married
him!
Perhaps
because
of
fear
his
latest
book
a
life
of
Nelson
bore
the
placating
dedication
To
Letitia
in
gratitude
for
her
sweet
company
Sanctimonious
fool!
So
they
kissed
for
what
Jane
knew
would
be
the
last
time
in
Belgrave
Square
Goodbye
to
another
dream
that
had
died
She
felt
angry
with
herself
for
getting
carried
away
by
the
ideas
in
her
head
for
turning
her
back
on
reality
She
deserved
to
pay
the
price
All
the
same
she
could
not
bear
to
listen
to
the
Sibelius
concerto
for
some
time
afterwards
True
they
had
not
suited
each
other
but
supposing
the
chemistry
had
been
right
should
such
a
relationship
have
been
ruined
by
the
wretched
man-made
social
system
There
is
nothing
a
woman
wants
so
much
as
to
be
in
love
and
the
odds
are
very
much
against
two
right
people
ever
finding
each
other
The
whole
of
human
life
is
a
matter
of
chance
and
we
only
live
once!
Jane
knew
from
bitter
experience
that
love
is
a
rare
thing
so
she
felt
very
strongly
that
nothing
should
be
allowed
to
come
in
its
way
that
nobody
should
be
condemned
to
endure
the
rest
of
life
with
those
two
small
sad
words
if
only
Jane
had
played
her
cards
and
played
them
wrong
She
had
married
too
soon
and
was
married
too
long
She
was
resigned
never
to
meet
the
right
man
She
had
to
let
imagination
take
over
Her
namesake
Jane
Austen
she
supposed
had
found
the
same
so
she
invented
Darcy
and
Mr
Knightley
The
same
went
for
the
Bront
s
Charlotte's
late
marriage
being
irrelevant
so
in
a
perfect
world
we
should
certainly
have
been
deprived
of
these
characters
Five-year-old
Peach
could
remember
when
she
was
very
small
looking
up
to
Lais's
great
height
trying
to
catch
her
sister's
impatient
glance
and
sliding
her
small
hand
into
Lais's
cool
one
always
wanting
to
be
with
her
to
go
where
Lais
was
Now
that
she
was
older
she
was
allowed
to
sit
on
the
white
carpet
in
Lais's
room
waiting
while
her
sister
prepared
for
some
evening
out
She
would
hold
the
beautiful
earrings
for
her
or
slide
sparkling
rings
on
to
Lais's
white
fingers
touching
the
long
lacquered
nails
wonderingly
her
mouth
copying
Lais's
pout
as
she
applied
the
lovely
shiny
red
lipstick
Amelie
fell
and
broke
her
hip
just
two
days
before
they
were
due
to
sail
on
the
liner
for
France
Lais
was
furious
at
the
thought
of
forfeiting
the
trip
it
was
to
be
her
first
visit
to
Paris
since
she
had
been
brought
home
by
Leonie
five
years
ago
in
disgrace
Peach
had
heard
whispered
though
she
didn't
understand
why
But
it
was
not
Lais's
anger
that
caused
their
parents
to
relent
and
allow
them
to
go
alone
it
was
Leonie's
disappointment
Very
well
Gerard
said
sternly
to
Lais
while
Peach
hovered
anxiously
in
the
background
But
you
will
be
in
charge
of
your
little
sister
We
are
trusting
Peach
to
your
care
on
this
trip
Don't
worry
Gerard
Lais
called
dancing
her
way
from
the
room
Peach
will
be
just
fine
I'll
take
good
care
of
her
Peach
dashed
excitedly
along
to
the
nursery
flinging
aside
the
stuffed
animals
her
teddy
the
Raggedy
Ann
doll
and
the
friendly
little
dog
on
wheels
desperately
trying
to
find
it
At
last!
There
it
was
banished
to
the
back
of
the
toy
cupboard
by
Amelie
angry
with
Lais
for
buying
something
so
totally
unsuitable
It
was
still
in
its
elegant
burgundy
box
and
Peach
ran
an
admiring
finger
over
the
raised
gold
letters
Cartier
Lifting
the
lid
she
flung
aside
the
protective
layers
of
tissue-paper
It
was
a
beautiful
grown-up
dressing
case
fashioned
from
smooth
burgundy
leather
with
a
tiny
little
gold
lock
and
key
at
the
front
and
on
top
her
initials
M.I.L
de
C
and
then
beneath
that
in
gold
Peach
Smiling
she
turned
the
tiny
key
and
peered
inside
The
deep
claret
suede
felt
soft
to
her
small
exploring
fingers
There
were
little
compartments
meant
for
trinkets
and
jewels
crystal
jars
with
enamelled
lids
for
potions
and
powders
and
the
prettiest
gold
and
enamel
hairbrush
and
comb
It
was
Lais's
christening
gift
to
her
and
Peach
sat
back
on
her
heels
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
The
little
case
was
exactly
what
she
would
need
for
travelling
with
Lais
Papa
took
them
to
New
York
The
pier
was
abustle
with
voyagers
and
well-wishers
and
friends
A
band
played
merrily
and
to
Peach
the
waiting
liner
looked
as
big
as
their
hotel
in
Florida
Papa
carried
Peach
up
the
gangplank
and
Peach
carried
her
precious
case
Their
staterooms
were
filled
with
flowers
and
she
ran
around
excitedly
wondering
how
this
could
possibly
be
a
boat
when
it
looked
just
like
a
proper
room
while
Gerard
talked
quietly
with
Lais
looking
very
serious
And
then
there
was
a
flurry
of
kisses
and
goodbyes
and
they
were
waving
to
Papa
on
the
pier
and
throwing
coloured
streamers
while
the
band
played
far
too
loudly
and
quite
suddenly
she
wanted
to
cry
Oh
no
you
don't
Lais
said
firmly
no
crying
when
you're
with
me
So
Peach
swallowed
hard
and
licked
away
the
solitary
tear
that
had
crept
to
the
corner
of
her
mouth
The
first
night
at
sea
Lais
dressed
her
in
her
prettiest
dress
white
organdy
with
a
red
satin
sash
and
little
red
slippers
and
then
she
had
to
sit
still
so
as
not
to
get
creased
while
Lais
designed
her
face
for
the
evening
Lais's
dress
was
as
scarlet
as
Peach's
sash
a
slender
column
that
foamed
around
her
ankles
like
the
wake
left
by
the
liner
At
dinner
they
sat
at
a
table
with
other
people
and
a
big
man
with
a
lot
of
gold
braid
on
his
smart
jacket
who
smiled
at
Peach
a
lot
and
told
her
how
pretty
she
looked
Afterwards
they
went
dancing
and
Peach
sat
on
a
big
gilt
chair
clutching
Lais's
tiny
satin
purse
to
her
chest
so
that
it
wouldn't
get
lost
because
Lais
had
told
her
to
look
after
it
After
a
while
she
began
to
yawn
Her
eyelids
drooped
from
the
smoke
and
fatigue
It
was
so
noisy
and
she
couldn't
see
Lais
anywhere
Fatherly
men
patted
her
head
admiringly
and
older
ladies
frowned
at
the
sight
of
her
Surely
the
child
should
be
in
bed
they
murmured
Whoever
is
her
mother
She's
not
my
mother
Peach
replied
sleepily
she's
my
sister
Lais
Disgraceful
they
complained
keeping
a
child
up
like
that
Lais
returned
and
hauled
her
off
to
bed
angrily
Stupid
busy-bodies
she
muttered
as
she
dragged
Peach
along
endless
corridors
lurching
as
the
boat
swung
under
their
feet
you
didn't
want
to
go
to
bed
did
you
No
Oh
no
replied
Peach
trying
to
keep
up
with
Lais's
long
stride
All
she
wanted
was
to
be
with
Lais
Lais
unlocked
the
cabin
door
and
pushed
her
inside
Come
on
then
into
bed
with
you
She
pulled
off
Peach's
pretty
white
dress
hurriedly
Peach
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
sliding
off
the
little
red
slippers
What
about
my
teeth
she
asked
thinking
of
her
mother
In
the
morning
called
Lais
already
at
the
door
But
Lais
Where
are
you
going
Peach
sat
up
in
bed
anxiously
She
still
wore
her
vest
and
knickers
and
her
socks
There
was
no
sign
of
her
nightie
or
a
drink
of
milk
or
anything
And
where
was
Teddy
Lais
hesitated
then
hurried
back
across
the
room
and
hauled
the
teddy
bear
from
beneath
a
pile
of
clothes
There
she
said
Now
go
to
sleep
Peach
relaxed
under
the
covers
Yes
she
murmured
yawning
But
Lais
Where
are
you
going
Dancing
said
Lais
closing
the
door
Lais
danced
her
way
across
the
Atlantic
Ocean
sleeping
during
the
day
Peach
was
placed
in
the
nursery
with
other
children
and
had
a
lot
of
fun
there
with
the
nannies
and
the
toys
and
games
But
she
was
lonely
and
she
missed
her
mother
and
Lais
Each
night
she
sat
and
watched
Lais
prepare
for
her
evening
but
now
she
had
early
supper
with
other
children
and
was
tucked
up
in
bed
before
Lais
left
for
dinner
The
rhythm
of
the
boat
was
soothing
a
sort
of
low
wallow
and
roll
that
lulled
her
to
sleep
like
a
rocking
chair
and
only
occasionally
did
she
wake
when
Lais
came
in
sometimes
thinking
she
heard
laughter
and
voices
from
the
next
room
In
Paris
they
went
straight
to
the
de
Courmont
town
house
on
the
Ile
St
Louis
Peach
felt
a
little
awed
by
its
grand
rooms
and
suspicious
of
those
fat
babies
that
Lais
called
cherubs
peeking
down
at
her
from
the
ceilings
She
was
allowed
into
the
kitchens
to
have
milk
and
a
chunk
of
bread
with
chocolate
pain
chocolat
something
Maman
would
never
have
permitted
had
she
been
there
One
night
she
awoke
with
a
pain
in
her
stomach
She
didn't
know
how
late
it
was
but
she
climbed
out
of
bed
and
went
in
search
of
Lais
She
hurried
along
the
corridor
relieved
to
see
that
there
was
a
chink
of
light
beneath
Lais's
door
Opening
it
she
gazed
puzzled
at
the
two
people
there
She
didn't
recognize
Lais
at
first
because
she
was
sort
of
buried
beneath
the
man
They
looked
so
cosy
she
thought
enviously
with
their
arms
around
each
other
but
she
still
wondered
why
didn't
they
have
their
night
clothes
on
My
God
Peach!
Lais
leapt
from
the
bed
wrapping
the
sheet
around
her
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
here
You
shouldn't
say
that
word
said
Peach
disapprovingly
The
man
started
to
laugh
and
Lais
glared
at
him
angrily
grabbing
Peach's
hand
and
marching
her
from
the
room
She
gave
Peach
a
glass
of
water
with
a
hand
that
shook
Promise
she
said
that
you'll
never
tell
anyone
Anyone
at
all
Especially
Maman
and
Gerard
Peach
promised
though
she
did
wonder
why
it
should
be
such
a
secret
The
very
next
day
they
travelled
down
to
St
Jean
Cap
Ferrat
and
it
was
wonderful
to
see
Grand-m
re
She
looked
so
much
like
Maman
and
that
was
comforting
because
she
did
miss
Maman
so
And
there
was
Jim
who
made
her
laugh
and
played
games
of
hide-and-seek
with
her
and
helped
her
with
her
swimming
and
took
her
fishing
And
Leonore
her
other
sister
who
looked
like
Lais
but
was
different
Of
course
she
loved
Leonore
too
but
not
quite
like
Lais
After
a
while
Peach
began
to
notice
strange
things
People
would
break
off
their
conversations
when
she
came
into
the
room
they'd
put
on
that
special
sort
of
bright
face
that
grown-ups
use
when
they
want
to
amuse
the
children
but
their
eyes
weren't
smiling
the
way
they
used
to
And
when
they
thought
she
wasn't
around
their
faces
were
long
and
serious
War
they
said
it's
war
after
all
Peach
stared
at
the
disbelief
mirrored
in
their
faces
sensing
the
fear
that
lay
behind
the
unknown
word
Suddenly
there
was
a
flurry
of
activity
their
bags
were
packed
hurriedly
and
they
were
to
leave
that
very
day
Jim
had
managed
to
get
them
berths
on
a
ship
One
of
the
last
Peach
heard
him
telling
Lais
there's
no
time
left
You
must
leave
now
Peach
rubbed
her
aching
head
tiredly
Please
can't
I
stay
she
begged
clinging
to
Jim's
hand
Don't
you
and
Grand-m
re
want
me
any
more
Jim
swung
her
up
in
his
arms
We
want
you
he
smiled
but
so
do
your
maman
and
papa
We'll
see
you
again
soon
little
Peach
and
anyway
I'm
driving
you
to
Marseilles
so
it's
not
quite
goodbye
yet
On
the
journey
Peach
slept
at
first
but
they
seemed
to
be
stopping
and
starting
all
the
time
and
the
car
was
stuffy
She
peered
out
of
the
windows
and
noticed
that
everyone
else
seemed
to
be
driving
the
same
way
west
towards
Spain
Please
she
begged
can't
we
go
back
My
eyes
hurt
and
my
head
Stretch
out
on
the
seat
and
try
to
sleep
darling
commanded
Lais
sitting
in
the
front
with
Jim
this
looks
like
being
a
long
drive
But
Lais
my
head
really
hurts
Peach
leaned
forward
threading
her
arms
around
her
sister's
neck
and
resting
her
aching
head
against
Lais's
cool
cheek
Lais
took
Peach's
hand
in
hers
Jim
she
said
in
a
small
voice
I
think
we're
in
trouble
Jim
tore
his
anxious
gaze
from
the
road
and
their
glances
met
She's
burning
with
fever
Lais
said
quietly
Lais
held
her
in
her
arms
all
the
way
back
to
the
villa
Leonie
hurried
to
greet
them
surprised
and
dismayed
by
their
return
She
swept
Peach
off
and
plunged
her
into
a
bath
of
cool
water
gradually
adding
ice
until
the
coolness
penetrated
Peach's
very
bones
Then
the
doctor
arrived
and
examined
her
gravely
Lais
laughed
when
he
said
it
was
measles
a
severe
case
I
always
thought
measles
were
simple
she
said
Trust
Peach
to
exaggerate
them
We'll
get
the
next
boat
Jim
said
wearily
Peach
grew
worse
Her
head
felt
as
though
it
would
burst
and
her
legs
hurt
Then
her
chest
began
to
feel
as
though
it
were
crushing
her
Papa
she
cried
twisting
her
head
from
side
to
side
to
try
to
rid
herself
of
the
pain
searching
in
vain
for
a
cool
spot
on
the
pillows
that
were
soon
soaked
with
her
sweat
Papa
It's
not
measles
its
poliomyelitis
said
Doctor
Marnaux
at
the
hospital
in
Nice
a
rare
disease
that
affects
mainly
children
and
young
people
She
will
be
put
on
a
respirator
to
help
her
breathe
but
Madame
and
Monsieur
his
large
brown
eyes
faced
them
sadly
I'm
afraid
I
cannot
offer
much
hope
Lais
hurled
herself
at
the
doctor
What
do
you
mean
she
cried
Are
you
saying
my
sister
is
going
to
die
Gripping
the
lapels
of
his
starched
white
coat
fiercely
she
looked
ready
to
kill
him
Mademoiselle
Mademoiselle
please
he
tried
futilely
to
remove
her
I
cannot
say
It
is
a
disease
of
which
we
have
little
knowledge
We
can
only
hope
Lais's
hands
dropped
limply
to
her
sides
and
the
doctor
smoothed
his
ruffled
coat
nervously
I
will
do
my
best
for
her
of
course
We
all
will
Doctor
Marnaux
said
Leonie
in
a
high
clear
voice
My
granddaughter
will
not
die
You
understand
Monsieur
She
will
not
die
Doctor
Marnaux
eyed
the
frantic
young
woman
and
the
quietly
desperate
older
one
nervously
Of
course
not
Madame
he
replied
soothingly
of
course
not
I
will
stay
with
her
said
Leonie
walking
to
the
severe
white
door
behind
which
her
granddaughter
lay
The
doctor
glanced
at
Jim
and
shrugged
helplessly
As
she
wishes
Monsieur
he
murmured
We
have
done
all
we
can
All
transatlantic
telephone
lines
were
occupied
and
calls
were
already
being
censored
or
curtailed
It
took
Jim
two
days
and
considerable
influence
to
reach
Gerard
in
Miami
I'm
leaving
right
away
said
Gerard
his
voice
tense
across
the
crackle
and
woosh
of
the
line
Things
are
already
difficult
here
warned
Jim
Remember
once
you
are
here
as
a
French
citizen
you
may
find
it
impossible
to
leave
Even
if
Peach
were
not
so
ill
replied
Gerard
I
would
return
to
do
what
I
can
for
my
country
Gerard
had
only
ever
taken
a
nominal
interest
in
the
de
Courmont
business
empire
built
by
his
father
preferring
to
leave
the
running
of
Monsieur's
vast
automobile
plants
and
their
peripheral
companies
the
monumental
iron
and
steel
works
the
rolling
mills
and
the
factories
at
Valenciennes
that
had
produced
guns
and
weapons
for
other
wars
to
the
capable
management
of
governing
boards
And
even
the
fact
that
the
empire
was
now
in
jeopardy
with
the
country
at
war
came
a
far
second
in
his
priorities
to
the
fact
that
his
beloved
little
Peach
was
desperately
ill

Mr

of
letter
O
the
doctor
Z
Hubert
Molland
She
knew
what
she
wanted
to
do
was
wrong
Not
really
wrong
Not
a
sin
Not
the
sort
of
thing
she
would
have
to
confess
to
Father
Molland
at
St
Clement's
on
Wednesday
afternoon
After
Mr
Coleby's
visit
she
needed
the
relief
it
would
give
her
John
had
asked
her
not
to
go
up
to
the
loft
But
he
hadn't
forbidden
her
Please
Lucasta
he'd
said
Just
for
me
I'm
not
an
invalid
Yes
I
know
dearest
But
it's
a
heavy
ladder
and
you'd
have
to
lug
it
all
the
way
upstairs
I'd
be
very
careful
You
might
slip
off
the
stepladder
Lifting
the
hatch
is
rather
tricky
even
for
me
He
ran
his
finger
down
the
nape
of
her
neck
And
then
you'd
have
to
haul
yourself
into
the
loft
Once
you
get
there
it's
a
minefield
It
hasn't
even
got
a
proper
floor
You
could
trap
a
foot
between
the
joists
or
something
But
it's
such
a
mess
she
said
I'd
like
to
sort
things
out
before
baby
arrives
He
knelt
down
beside
her
chair
His
face
was
only
inches
away
from
hers
His
concern
warmed
her
The
nesting
instinct
he
said
But
seriously
if
you
had
an
accident
when
I
was
at
school
you
might
lie
there
for
hours
It's
not
as
if
people
are
popping
in
and
out
of
the
house
all
day
No
this
was
their
home
they
didn't
want
strangers
to
disturb
them
at/29
Champney
Road
That
was
the
way
it
would
always
be
For
ever
and
ever
Amen
All
right
dear
John
didn't
like
her
going
up
to
the
loft
especially
when
he
was
out
of
the
house
She
would
never
disobey
him
she
had
promised
But
he
hadn't
actually
made
it
an
order
In
any
case
when
they
had
talked
about
it
the
circumstances
had
been
different
At
the
time
she
had
had
Peter
in
her
tummy
and
a
fall
could
have
had
serious
consequences
for
both
herself
and
the
unborn
baby
John
was
very
late
this
evening
It
had
been
dark
for
hours
In
termtime
he
worked
all
the
hours
God
gave
The
school
didn't
appreciate
his
dedication
She
wished
he
would
come
home
She
wished
he
had
been
here
when
that
unpleasant
Mr
Coleby
had
called
Dealing
with
people
like
Mr
Coleby
was
a
man's
job
John
would
have
known
exactly
what
to
say
to
him
Mr
Coleby
was
clever
He
always
came
when
John
was
at
school
She
had
been
expecting
Hubert
Molland
with
the
parish
magazine
which
was
why
she
had
answered
the
door
Mr
Coleby
was
standing
right
on
the
step
His
big
brown
car
was
parked
beneath
the
streetlamp
on
the
road
As
she
opened
the
door
he
leaned
forwards
She
stepped
back
Too
late
she
realized
her
mistake
He
was
in
the
house
Flecks
of
rain
sparkled
on
the
shoulders
of
his
navy-blue
overcoat
Mr
Coleby
had
a
loud
Fen
voice
with
broad
vowels
that
grated
on
her
ears
She
was
afraid
that
he
would
wake
Peter
if
she
talked
to
him
in
the
hall
She
retreated
to
the
sitting
room
He
followed
He
was
a
big
man
with
a
square
red
face
The
room
was
small
and
so
was
she
Mr
Coleby
was
out
of
scale
He
took
up
too
much
space
like
a
baby
cuckoo
in
someone
else's
nest
Well
Mrs
Redburn
he
said
I
wondered
if
you'd
reconsidered
your
position
She
shook
her
head
She
sat
down
to
conceal
the
fact
that
she
was
trembling
Mr
Coleby
sighed
It
would
be
nice
to
get
something
settled
by
Christmas
Lucasta
stared
at
the
pile
of
library
books
on
the
table
There's
nothing
to
settle
Now
be
reasonable
Your
reasons
she
said
Not
mine
You
won't
get
a
better
offer
Sorry
Not
interested
He
moved
to
the
bay
window
parted
the
curtains
and
looked
out
on
Champney
Road
It's
a
funny
area
isn't
it
he
said
I
reckon
you'd
be
happier
somewhere
like
Locksley
Gardens
or
Ivanhoe
Drive
I'm
quite
happy
here
thank
you
Lucasta
said
However
she
understood
what
he
meant
Hubert
Molland
had
said
as
much
the
other
day
Champney
Road
was
on
the
east
side
of
Plumford
Here
were
the
factories
the
council
estates
and
just
a
few
yards
beyond
the
Redburns
back
garden
the
railway
Most
of
John's
colleagues
lived
to
the
west
of
the
town
centre
in
a
suburb
where
the
professional
classes
clustered
in
a
grid
of
tree-lined
streets
with
names
taken
from
the
works
of
Sir
Walter
Scott
Not
much
of
a
house
either
Don't
you
find
it
dark
A
bit
depressing
Needs
a
lot
of
work
done
to
it
Anyone
can
see
that
She
shrugged
Money
was
tight
especially
since
Peter's
arrival
She
didn't
think
the
house
was
dark
True
it
faced
north
but
you
got
used
to
that
Number
was
their
home
You're
quite
isolated
too
Not
even
a
telephone
Mr
Coleby
peered
into
the
darkness
on
either
side
of
the
streetlamp
Big
hedge
in
front
needs
a
trim
that
does
A
blank
wall
the
height
of
a
house
on
your
right
Can't
say
I'd
like
to
live
next
to
a
bakery
And
on
the
other
side
you've
got
all
those
trees
on
the
strip
of
wasteland
My
wasteland
now
You
must
find
it
quite
worrying
He
turned
slowly
and
stared
at
her
Seeing
as
you're
on
your
own
for
so
much
of
the
time
The
little
room
filled
with
menace
It
hung
like
a
haze
and
obscured
the
outlines
of
the
furniture
Mr
Coleby
was
a
huge
shadow
His
face
dissolved
Only
his
eyes
were
as
crisply
defined
as
before
cold
clear
and
blue
If
only
John
were
here
Lucasta
touched
her
breast
It
was
full
of
milk
The
knowledge
steadied
her
Peter
was
still
feeding
from
her
and
would
continue
to
do
so
for
months
She
had
to
be
strong
The
haze
cleared
I'm
afraid
you're
wasting
your
time
Mr
Coleby
Am
I
He
raised
his
eyebrows
Why
don't
you
have
another
little
think
about
it
It's
a
big
decision
I
know
that
You've
got
to
look
at
all
the
angles
The
decision's
already
Like
for
example
what
happens
if
you
have
an
accident
when
you're
alone
in
the
house
Or
if
there's
a
fire
in
the
night
Or
if
some
of
the
local
yobbos
come
round
in
search
of
beer
money
or
a
bit
of
fun
Deliver
me
from
evil
she
thought
For
Thine
is
the
kingdom
the
power
and
the
glory
You're
threatening
me
Me
He
chuckled
That's
a
good
one
Just
trying
to
help
Mrs
Redburn
that's
all
You
know
me
Anyway
I
mustn't
keep
you
Don't
bother
I
can
find
my
own
way
out
I'll
be
in
touch
Mr
Coleby's
footsteps
echoed
in
the
uncarpeted
hall
She
hoped
that
they
wouldn't
wake
Peter
She
heard
him
open
and
close
the
front
door
The
latch
on
the
front
gate
clicked
She
went
to
the
window
A
moment
later
the
big
brown
car
pulled
away
from
the
kerb
Lucasta
went
into
the
hall
She
was
tempted
to
bolt
the
door
But
if
she
did
that
John
wouldn't
be
able
to
let
himself
in
with
his
key
She
never
used
the
bolts
when
John
was
out
Hurry
home
John
She
listened
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
All
was
quiet
which
was
a
blessing
Peter
had
only
just
begun
to
go
through
the
night
without
demanding
a
feed
Unbroken
nights
were
such
a
luxury
In
the
evenings
she
and
John
had
time
to
be
together
Gradually
the
trembling
stopped
She
tiptoed
upstairs
and
listened
outside
the
door
of
Peter's
room
She
didn't
dare
go
in
he
was
such
a
light
sleeper
and
he
seemed
to
know
by
instinct
when
his
mother
was
in
the
same
room
She
glanced
upwards
at
the
hatch
that
led
to
the
loft
The
temptation
was
so
strong
it
made
her
feel
breathless
John
wouldn't
mind
if
she
went
into
the
loft
He
would
understand
She
would
tell
him
about
Mr
Coleby's
visit
and
her
going
to
the
loft
as
soon
as
he
came
in
She
crept
downstairs
through
the
kitchen
and
out
into
the
little
back
garden
It
was
much
darker
on
this
side
of
the
house
Behind
the
garden
were
several
acres
of
rough
pasture
which
Mr
Coleby
had
bought
at
the
same
time
as
he
bought
the
strip
of
wasteland
that
linked
the
pasture
to
Champney
Road
The
railway
ran
in
a
cutting
along
the
far
boundary
of
the
fields
You
couldn't
see
the
trains
but
you
could
hear
them
The
stepladder
was
strapped
to
the
outside
wall
beneath
the
kitchen
window
John
had
built
a
little
shelter
for
it
he
was
so
clever
with
his
hands
She
undid
the
straps
and
carried
the
ladder
into
the
house
Mindful
of
what
John
had
said
she
stopped
to
rest
once
in
the
hall
twice
on
the
stairs
and
once
on
the
landing
She
set
up
the
ladder
beneath
the
hatch
Practice
had
made
perfect
she
hardly
made
a
sound
Peter
slept
on
Rung
by
rung
she
crept
up
the
ladder
Two-thirds
of
the
way
up
she
paused
to
get
her
breath
back
before
lifting
the
heavy
hatch
and
sliding
it
away
from
the
opening
A
shower
of
gritty
dust
pattered
on
her
face
Try
as
she
might
it
was
impossible
to
keep
the
loft
as
clean
as
she
would
have
liked
She
climbed
higher
and
at
last
managed
the
difficult
transition
from
the
top
of
the
ladder
to
the
edge
of
the
hatch
frame
She
glanced
down
at
the
landing
and
the
dizziness
swept
up
to
meet
her
Serves
you
right
my
girl
she
whispered
You
know
you've
got
no
head
for
heights
Lucasta
reached
through
the
darkness
for
the
light
switch
The
loft
sprang
to
life
She
sighed
with
relief
The
loft
ran
the
length
of
the
house
from
front
to
back
and
it
was
lit
by
two
unshaded
forty-watt
bulbs
Down
the
centre
was
a
narrow
gangway
she
had
placed
boards
across
the
joists
to
make
movement
easier
On
either
side
of
the
gangway
were
neat
piles
of
trunks
cases
cardboard
boxes
and
tea
chests
even
a
bed
propped
on
its
side
and
wrapped
in
polythene
Everything
was
as
she
had
left
it
Everything
was
in
apple-pie
order
For
a
moment
she
stood
listening
Peter
was
still
asleep
She
walked
slowly
down
the
gangway
her
eyes
lingering
on
the
treasures
she
passed
She
paused
twice
First
she
lifted
the
lid
of
a
trunk
plastered
with
the
labels
of
railway
companies
The
smell
of
mothballs
rose
to
greet
her
She
stroked
the
lapel
of
one
of
John's
old
suits
a
Prince
of
Wales
check
that
he
had
bought
before
they
even
met
She
shut
the
trunk
and
moved
on
to
a
large
cardboard
box
She
eased
off
the
lid
Inside
buried
in
acid-free
tissue
paper
was
her
wedding
dress
She
closed
her
eyes
and
let
her
fingers
burrow
through
the
tissue
paper
until
she
felt
the
lace
of
the
collar
One
day
God
willing
she
and
John
might
have
a
daughter
one
day
their
daughter
would
want
to
get
married
Carefully
she
replaced
the
tissue
paper
and
the
lid
of
the
box
Her
excitement
grew
steadily
higher
On
the
left
near
the
end
of
the
gangway
was
a
blue
suitcase
resting
on
top
of
a
tea
chest
John
kept
the
photographs
here
Before
their
marriage
he
had
made
quite
a
hobby
of
photography
Some
photographs
were
in
albums
others
in
envelopes
and
folders
and
everything
was
neatly
labelled
John
was
a
scientist
by
training
and
inclination
he
had
a
passion
for
order
It
was
one
of
the
many
characteristics
they
shared
She
stared
at
the
contents
Spoiled
for
choice
she
thought
like
a
kid
in
a
sweetshop
She
glanced
at
the
framed
print
of
John
at
the
Salpertons
wedding
which
was
lying
on
top
John
had
been
best
man
he
looked
so
beautiful
in
morning
dress
far
more
handsome
than
the
groom
Tonight
because
of
Mr
Coleby's
visit
and
because
John
was
so
late
she
deserved
a
treat
She
would
compare
the
snaps
they'd
taken
of
Peter
on
the
lawn
in
the
summer
with
the
photographs
of
John
as
a
baby
She
delighted
in
finding
resemblances
between
father
and
son
My
two
men
she
crooned
She
lifted
out
the
Salperton
photograph
Underneath
was
a
team
photograph
a
schoolboy
cricket
eleven
with
John
the
second
from
the
right
in
the
back
row
As
she
lifted
it
out
she
realized
that
the
backing
was
beginning
to
come
away
from
the
heavy
cream
cardboard
of
the
mount
Perhaps
the
loft
was
too
damp
to
store
photographs
She
would
have
to
mention
it
to
John
She
examined
the
edge
of
the
mount
All
it
needed
was
a
little
glue
She
would
do
it
this
evening
John
would
be
pleased
The
edge
of
a
sheet
of
paper
between
the
mount
and
the
backing
caught
her
eye
She
widened
the
gap
and
tried
to
see
what
it
was
Not
the
print
itself
that
was
further
inside
the
mount
She
gripped
the
edge
of
the
paper
between
thumb
and
forefinger
and
gently
pulled
it
out
It
was
a
letter
written
in
blue
ink
The
handwriting
was
small
and
upright
Lucasta
knew
instinctively
that
it
belonged
to
a
woman
There
was
neither
date
nor
address
Johnny
The
doctor
agrees
so
there's
no
doubt
any
longer
She
read
to
the
end
A
mistake
it
must
be
a
mistake
or
a
forgery
Pain
stabbed
at
her
chest
twisting
like
a
barbed
snake
Lucasta
screamed
The
pain
retreated
The
snake
was
biding
its
time
She
stumbled
down
the
gangway
to
the
hatch
Sobbing
for
breath
she
lowered
herself
on
to
the
ladder
For
once
in
her
life
she
left
the
loft
with
the
lights
on
and
the
hatch
open
The
letter
slipped
from
her
hand
and
fluttered
to
the
landing
floor
John
how
could
you
Lucasta
pushed
open
the
door
of
Peter's
room
and
went
in
She
wanted
more
than
anything
she
had
ever
wanted
in
her
life
to
pick
up
her
baby
and
cuddle
him
to
feel
his
warmth
to
feel
his
need
for
her
Peter
wake
up
It's
Mummy
But
the
cot
had
gone
In
its
place
was
a
narrow
bed
stripped
to
its
horsehair
mattress

O'Rourke's

came
through
calm

precise
and
unmistakably
Irish
O'Rourke
was
commonly
referred
to
as
the

which
he

Just
picked
up
an
odd-looking

Forty

Talbot
pressed
the
reply
button
The
skies
above
us
Chief
are
hotching
with
odd-looking
customers
At
least
six
airlines
criss-cross
this
patch
of
the
Aegean
NATO
planes
as
you
know
better
than
all
of

are

And
those

from

listeth
Me
I
think
they're
lost
half

Ah!
But
this
is
a
very
odd
odd-looking
lad
O'Rourke's
voice
was
unruffled
as
ever
unmoved
by
the
less
than
flattering
reference
to
the
Sixth
Fleet
from
which
he
was
on
temporary
loan
No

There
are
no
NATO

in

And
the

would
have

A

courteous

Captain

I

True

Talbot
was
aware
would
have
informed
him
of
the
presence
of
any
of
their
aircraft
in
his
vicinity
not
from
courtesy
but
because
regulations
demanded
it
a
fact
of
which
O'Rourke
was
as
well
aware
as
he
was
O'Rourke
was
a
doughty
defender
of
his
home
fleet
That
all
you
have
on

This

due
south-west
to

course
I
have
no
record
no

of
any
plane
that
could
be
following

Secondly
I'm
pretty
sure
it's
a
big

We
should
see
in
about
four
minutes
his

is
on
a

The

Keep
an
eye
on
him
Talbot
looked
around
and
caught
the
eye
of
his
second-in-command
Lieutenant-Commander
Van
Gelder
Van
Gelder
was
short
very
broad
deeply
tanned
flaxen-haired
and
seemed
to
find
life
a
source
of
constant
amusement
He
was
smiling
now
as
he
approached
the
captain
Consider
it
done
sir
The
spy-glass
and
a
photo
for
your
family
album
That's
it
Thank
you
The
Ariadne
carried
an
immense
and
to
the
uninitiated
quite
bewildering
variety
of
looking
and
listening
instruments
that
may
well
have
been
unmatched
by
any
naval
ship
afloat
Among
those
instruments
were
what
Van
Gelder
had
referred
to
as
the
spy-glass
This
was
a
combined
telescope
and
camera
invented
and
built
by
the
French
of
the
type
used
by
spy
satellites
in
orbit
and
which
was
capable
under
ideal
atmospheric
circumstances
of
locating
and
photographing
a
white
plate
from
an
altitude
of
miles
The
focal
length
of
the
telescope
was
almost
infinitely
adjustable
in
this
case
Van
Gelder
would
probably
use
a
one
in
a
hundred
resolution
which
would
have
the
optical
effect
of
bringing
the
intruder
if
intruder
it
was
to
an
apparent
altitude
of
four
hundred
feet
In
the
cloudless
July
skies
of
the
Cyclades
this
presented
no
problem
at
all
Van
Gelder
had
just
left
the
bridge
when
another
loudspeaker
came
to
life
the
repeated
double
buzzer
identifying
it
as
the
radio-room
The
helmsman
Leading
Seaman
Harrison
leaned
forward
and
made
the
appropriate

Myers
the
radio
operator
on

sounded
annoyed
every
radio
operator
the
tone
of
his
voice
said
should
be
as
expert
and
efficient
as
he
was
Wait
a
minute
though
There
was
a
pause
then
Myers
came
on
again
Sinking
he
says
Four
times
he
said
he
was
sinking
Talbot
said
That
all
That's
all
sir
He's
gone
off
the
air
Well
just
keep
listening
on
the
distress
frequency
Harrison
or
near
enough
Can't
be
more
than
ten
twelve
miles
away
He
reached
for
the
engine
control
and
turned
it
up
to
full
power.The
Ariadne
in
the
modern
fashion
had
dual
engine-room
and
bridge
controls
The
engine-room
had
customarily
only
one
rating
a
leading
stoker
on
watch
and
this
only
because
custom
dictated
it
not
because
necessity
demanded
it
The
lone
watchman
might
just
possibly
be
wandering
around
with
an
oil-can
in
hand
but
more
probably
was
immersed
in
one
of
the
lurid
magazines
with
which
what
was
called
the
engine-room
library
was
so
liberally
stocked
The
Ariadne's
chief
engineer
Lieutenant
McCafferty
rarely
ventured
near
his
own
domain
A
first-class
engineer
McCafferty
claimed
he
was
allergic
to
diesel
fumes
and
treated
with
a
knowing
disdain
the
frequently
repeated
observation
that
because
of
the
engine-room's
highly
efficient
extractor
fans
it
was
virtually
impossible
for
anyone
to
detect
the
smell
of
diesel
He
was
to
be
found
that
afternoon
as
he
was
most
afternoons
seated
in
a
deckchair
aft
and
immersed
in
his
favourite
form
of
relaxation
the
reading
of
detective
novels
heavily
laced
with
romance
of
the
more
dubious
kind
The
distant
sound
of
the
diesels
deepened
the
Ariadne
was
capable
of
a
very
respectable
knots
and
the
bridge
began
to
vibrate
quite
noticeably
Talbot
reached
for
a
phone
and
got
through
to
Van
Gelder
We've
picked
up
a
distress
signal
Ten
twelve
miles
away
Let
me
know
when
you
locate
this
bandit
and
I'll
cut
the
engines
The
spy-glass
though
splendidly
gimballed
to
deal
with
the
worst
vagaries
of
pitching
and
rolling
was
quite
incapable
of
coping
with
even
the
mildest
vibration
which
more
often
than
not
produced
a
very
fuzzy
photograph
indeed
Talbot
moved
out
on
to
the
port
wing
to
join
the
lieutenant
who
stood
there
a
tall
thin
young
man
with
fair
hair
thick
pebbled
glasses
and
a
permanently
lugubrious
expression
Well
Jimmy
how
do
you
fancy
this
A
maybe
bandit
and
a
sinking
vessel
at
the
same
time
Should
relieve
the
tedium
of
a
long
hot
summer's
afternoon
don't
you
think
The
lieutenant
looked
at
him
without
enthusiasm
Lieutenant
the
Lord
James
Denholm
Talbot
called
him
Jimmy
for
brevity's
sake
seldom
waxed
enthusiastic
about
anything
I
don't
fancy
it
at
all
Captain
Denholm
waved
a
languid
hand
Disturbs
the
even
tenor
of
my
ways
Talbot
smiled
Denholm
was
surrounded
by
an
almost
palpable
aura
of
aristocratic
exhaustion
that
had
disturbed
and
irritated
Talbot
in
the
early
stage
of
their
acquaintanceship
a
feeling
that
had
lasted
for
no
more
than
half
an
hour
Denholm
was
totally
unfitted
to
be
a
naval
officer
of
any
kind
and
his
highly
defective
eyesight
should
have
led
to
his
automatic
disbarment
from
any
navy
in
the
world
But
Denholm
was
aboard
the
Ariadne
not
because
of
his
many
connections
with
the
highest
echelons
of
society
heir
to
an
earldom
his
blood
was
indisputably
the
bluest
of
the
blue
but
because
without
question
he
was
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
The
holder
of
three
scientific
degrees
from
Oxford
UCLA
and
MIT
all
summa
cum
laude
in
electrical
engineering
and
electronics
Denholm
was
as
close
to
being
an
electronics
wizard
as
any
man
could
ever
hope
to
be
Not
that
Denholm
would
have
claimed
to
be
anything
of
what
he
would
have
said
to
be
the
ridiculous
kind
Despite
his
lineage
and
academic
qualifications
Denholm
was
modest
and
retiring
to
a
fault
This
reticence
extended
even
to
the
making
of
protests
which
was
why
despite
his
feeble
objections
he
had
been
under
no
compulsion
to
go
he
had
been
dragooned
into
the
Navy
in
the
first
place
He
said
to
Talbot
This
bandit
Captain
if
it
is
a
bandit
what
do
you
intend
to
do
about
it
I
don't
intend
to
do
anything
about
it
But
if
he
is
a
bandit
well
then
he's
spying
isn't
he
Of
course
Well
then
What
do
you
expect
me
to
do
Jimmy
Bring
him
down
Or
are
you
itching
to
try
out
this
experimental
laser
gun
you
have
with
you
Heaven
forfend
Denholm
was
genuinely
horrified
I've
never
fired
a
gun
in
anger
in
my
life
Correction
I've
never
even
fired
a
gun
If
I
wanted
to
bring
him
down
a
teeny-weeny
heat-seeking
missile
would
do
the
job
very
effectively
But
we
don't
do
things
like
that
We're
civilized
Besides
we
don't
provoke
international
incidents
An
unwritten
law
Sounds
a
very
funny
law
to
me
Not
at
all
When
the
United
States
or
NATO
play
war
games
as
we
are
doing
now
the
Soviets
track
us
very
closely
indeed
whether
on
land
sea
or
air
We
don't
complain
We
can't
When
they're
playing
their
game
we
do
exactly
the
same
to
them
Can
admittedly
have
its
awkward
moments
Not
so
long
ago
when
the
US
Navy
were
carrying
out
exercises
in
the
Sea
of
Japan
an
American
destroyer
banged
into
and
quite
severely
damaged
a
Russian
submarine
which
was
monitoring
things
a
little
too
closely
And
that
didn't
cause
what
you've
just
called
an
international
incident
Certainly
not
Nobody's
fault
Mutual
apologies
between
the
two
captains
and
the
Russian
was
towed
to
a
safe
port
by
another
Russian
warship
Vladivostok
I
believe
it
was
Talbot
turned
his
head
Excuse
me
That's
the
radio-room
call-up
Myers
again
the
speaker
said
Delos
Name
of
the
sinking
vessel
Very
brief
message
explosion
on
fire
sinking
fast
Keep
listening
Talbot
said
He
looked
at
the
helmsman
who
already
had
a
pair
of
binoculars
to
his
eyes
You
have
it
Harrison
Yes
sir
Harrison
handed
over
the
binoculars
and
twitched
the
wheel
to
port
Fire
off
the
port
bow
Talbot
picked
it
up
immediately
a
thin
black
column
of
smoke
rising
vertically
unwaveringly
into
the
blue
and
windless
sky
He
was
just
lowering
his
glasses
when
the
bell
rang
twice
again
It
was
O'Rourke
the
weatherman
or
more
officially
the
senior
long-range
radar
operator
Lost
him
I'm
afraid
The
bandit
I
mean
I
was
looking
at
the
vectors
on
either
side
of
him
to
see
if
he
had
any
friends
and
when
I
came
back
he
was
gone
Any
ideas
Chief
Well
O'Rourke
sounded
doubtful
He
could
have
exploded
but
I
doubt
it
So
do
I
We've
had
the
spy-glass
trained
on
his
approach
bearing
and
they'd
have
picked
up
an
explosion
for
sure
Then
he
must
have
gone
into
a
steep
dive
A
very
steep
dive
God
knows
why
I'll
find
him
The
speaker
clicked
off
Almost
at
once
a
telephone
rang
again
It
was
Van
Gelder
sir
Smoke
Plane
Could
be
the
bandit
Almost
certainly
is
The
weatherman's
just
lost
it
off
the
long-range
radar
screen
Probably
a
waste
of
time
but
try
to
get
that
photograph
anyway
He
moved
out
on
to
the
starboard
wing
and
trained
his
glasses
over
the
starboard
quarter
He
picked
it
up
immediately
a
heavy
dark
plume
of
smoke
with
he
thought
a
glow
of
red
at
its
centre
It
was
still
quite
high
at
an
altitude
of
four
or
five
thousand
feet
He
didn't
pause
to
check
how
deeply
the
plane
was
diving
or
whether
or
not
it
actually
was
on
fire
He
moved
quickly
back
into
the
bridge
and
picked
up
a
phone
Sub-Lieutenant
Cousteau
Quickly
A
brief
pause
Henri
Captain
Emergency
Have
the
launch
and
the
lifeboat
slung
outboard
Crews
to
stand
by
to
lower
Then
report
to
the
bridge
He
rang
down
to
the
engine-room
for
Slow
Ahead
then
said
to
Harrison
Hard
a-port
Steer
north
Denholm
who
had
moved
out
on
to
the
starboard
wing
returned
lowering
his
binoculars
Well
even
I
can
see
that
plane
Not
a
plane
rather
a
huge
streamer
of
smoke
Could
that
have
been
the
bandit
sir
if
it
was
a
bandit
Must
have
been
Denholm
said
tentatively
I
don't
care
much
for
his
line
of
approach
sir
I
don't
care
much
for
it
myself
Lieutenant
especially
if
it's
a
military
plane
and
even
more
especially
if
it's
carrying
bombs
of
any
sort
If
you
look
you'll
see
that
we're
getting
out
of
its
way
Ah
Evasive
action
Denholm
hesitated
then
said
doubtfully
Well
as
long
as
he
doesn't
alter
course
Dead
men
don't
alter
courses
That
they
don't
Van
Gelder
had
just
returned
to
the
bridge
And
the
man
or
the
men
behind
the
controls
of
that
plane
are
surely
dead
No
point
in
my
staying
there
sir
Gibson's
better
with
the
spy-glass
camera
than
I
am
and
he's
very
busy
with
it
We'll
have
plenty
of
photographs
to
show
you
but
I
doubt
whether
we'll
be
able
to
learn
very
much
from
them
As
bad
as
that
You
weren't
able
to
establish
anything
Very
little
I'm
afraid
I
did
see
the
outer
engine
on
the
port
wing
So
it's
a
four-engined
jet
Civil
or
military
I've
no
idea
A
moment
please
Talbot
moved
out
on
the
port
wing
looked
aft
saw
that
the
blazing
plane
there
was
no
mistaking
the
flames
now
was
due
astern
at
less
than
half
the
height
and
distance
than
when
he
had
first
seen
it
returned
to
the
bridge
told
Harrison
to
steer
due
north
then
turned
again
to
Van
Gelder
That
was
all
you
could
establish
About
Except
that
the
fire
is
definitely
located
in
the
nose
cone
which
would
rule
out
any
engine
explosion
It
couldn't
have
been
hit
by
a
missile
because
we
know
there
are
no
missile-carrying
planes
around
even
if
there
were
a
heat-seeking
missile
the
only
type
that
could
nail
it
at
that
altitude
would
have
gone
for
the
engines
not
the
nose
cone
It
could
only
have
been
an
up-front
internal
explosion
Talbot
nodded
reached
for
a
phone
asked
the
exchange
for
the
sick
bay
and
was
through
immediately
Doctor
Would
you
detail
an
SBA
with
first-aid
kit
to
stand
by
the
lifeboat
He
paused
for
a
moment
Sorry
no
time
to
explain
Come
on
up
to
the
bridge
He
looked
aft
through
the
starboard
wing
doorway
turned
and
took
the
wheel
from
the
helmsman
Take
a
look
Harrison
A
good
look
Harrison
moved
out
on
the
starboard
wing
had
his
good
look
it
took
him
only
a
few
seconds
returned
and
took
the
wheel
again
Awful
He
shook
his
head
They're
finished
sir
aren't
they
So
I
would
have
thought
They're
going
to
miss
us
by
at
least
a
quarter
mile
Maybe
a
half
Harrison
took
another
quick
look
through
the
doorway

Simpson
Are
bitches
born
or
bred
Constance
asked
on
the
night
of
her
mother's
funeral
She
and
her
Aunt
Louise
were
sitting
in
her
mother's
living
room
drinking
sherry
and
feeling
close
as
old
friends
and
allies
do
Listening
to
the
autumn
wind
moaning
across
this
corner
of
the
sparse
Northumberland
coastline
a
few
miles
south
of
Berwick-upon-Tweed
where
Nora
Simpson
had
lived
for
all
of
her
married
life
their
memories
of
her
were
vivid
Constance
wasn't
thinking
only
of
her
mother
She
was
looking
back
over
her
own
life
Bathed
in
the
bright
sun
of
Italy
and
glittering
with
social
and
commercial
success
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
had
always
been
menaced
by
dark
shadows
many
of
which
Constance
sometimes
thought
had
sprung
up
almost
to
punish
her
for
leaving
this
remote
area
so
early
in
her
adult
life
They
were
shadows
that
she
could
never
have
imagined
when
as
a
young
girl
she
had
run
along
the
cold
sands
of
Northumberland
and
watched
the
east
wind
flatten
and
fold
the
dunes
as
she
dreamed
of
a
bigger
more
exciting
world
beyond
and
away
from
her
mother's
influence
She
was
brought
back
to
the
moment
by
Louise
Oh
darling
I
think
that's
a
little
harsh
Her
aunt
frowned
slightly
Nora
was
very
strong-willed
I
know
but
I
don't
think
she
was
a
bitch
She
had
a
lot
to
contend
with
No
don't
misunderstand
me
Constance
went
on
I
was
thinking
more
of
myself
than
her
I
know
I'm
a
bitch
and
I
do
think
Nora
had
a
lot
to
do
with
it
but
I've
often
thought
that
it
was
you
know
in
the
genes
Well
Louise
laughed
you
certainly
couldn't
be
mistaken
for
anything
other
than
Nora
Simpson's
daughter
there's
no
doubt
about
that
but
to
be
fair
my
sweet
you've
both
had
a
lot
to
contend
with
You've
not
had
it
easy
but
bitch
is
far
too
unkind
You've
had
to
be
strong
to
survive
just
as
poor
Nora
had
to
be
when
your
father
died
and
she
was
left
on
her
own
Constance
looked
at
her
aunt
was
she
blaming
her
for
Nora's
lonely
last
years
Louise
Carter
was
a
woman
in
her
early
eighties
White-haired
and
with
make-up
applied
in
the
haphazard
way
that
suggests
no
great
interest
in
the
face
rather
than
a
weakening
of
the
critical
faculties
Louise
was
still
very
much
in
charge
of
herself
her
appearance
thought
and
manner
Constance
looked
at
her
fondly
Louise
who
had
been
her
comfort
buffer
and
rescuer
so
many
times
in
the
past
Louise
who
had
in
so
many
ways
been
more
of
a
mother
to
her
than
Nora
Louise
who
even
now
had
lost
none
of
her
vigour
and
strength
of
personality
You'd
think
that
she
was
still
in
her
sixties
Constance
thought
approvingly
as
Louise
took
out
a
cigarette
and
crossing
her
legs
decisively
made
herself
comfortable
on
the
sofa
You
were
closer
to
her
than
anyone
Constance
continued
Even
before
I
went
to
Italy
and
married
Ludo
I
never
really
knew
her
Actually
she
influenced
every
decision
I
ever
made
but
I
always
felt
she
put
a
barrier
between
us
But
I
honestly
don't
know
if
it
was
deliberate
or
just
our
chemistry
I've
never
understood
it
probably
because
I've
never
really
understood
her
Constance
slipped
off
her
shoes
and
curled
her
feet
under
her
She
was
sitting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
grate
and
Louise
Carter
thought
fleetingly
how
proud
Nora
had
always
been
of
her
daughter
even
when
they
had
been
dramatically
at
loggerheads
and
how
pleased
she
would
be
if
she
could
see
her
now
in
her
elegant
black
dress
and
silver
jewellery
Yes
my
dear
she
mused
affectionately
Signora
Villanuova
you
may
well
now
be
and
head
of
a
fashion
empire
but
every
attitude
you've
ever
had
came
from
Nora
She
made
you
strong
and
she
was
no
more
a
bitch
than
you
are
Sensing
that
her
aunt
needed
to
talk
Constance
poured
more
sherry
I
understood
her
perfectly
Louise
said
as
she
searched
in
her
bag
for
her
lighter
We
were
very
close
you
know
Much
more
than
just
cousins
I
remember
when
she
came
from
India
after
your
grandmother
died
She
looked
so
strange
Tall
dark
and
gawky
She
was
very
strong-willed
Couldn't
be
told
anything
My
father
used
to
get
so
angry
at
her
stubbornness
not
at
all
like
me
used
to
doing
what
I
was
told
There
was
a
pause
as
she
lit
her
cigarette
I
got
a
shock
yesterday
when
I
went
to
the
mortuary
Constance
said
I
didn't
realise
that
she'd
let
her
hair
grow
out
She
was
quite
white
I
couldn't
believe
my
eyes
And
the
nails
on
her
right
hand
were
filthy
I
had
to
clean
them
Darling
how
ghastly
for
you
Louise
commiserated
remembering
how
punctilious
over
her
appearance
her
cousin
Nora
had
always
been
Her
sophisticated
turnout
and
stylish
overdressing
had
made
her
a
minor
legend
in
this
remote
northern
district
It
was
horrible
Constance
said
I
had
to
lift
her
hand
It
was
so
hard
and
stiff
that
I
was
frightened
I
would
break
the
wrist
I
don't
know
how
I
managed
it
I
had
to
bend
over
parallel
to
the
body
to
get
the
nail
file
under
the
nails
I
was
frightened
in
case
anyone
came
in
It
would
have
looked
so
odd
But
I
had
to
do
it
She
was
always
so
obsessed
with
her
appearance
I
couldn't
let
her
go
to
her
grave
in
that
state
Her
hand
was
so
cold
She
shuddered
at
the
recollection
and
continued
Then
I
combed
her
hair
back
How
wispy
and
thin
it
was
Louise
was
silent
then
said
Poor
Nora
That's
why
I
was
the
only
one
she
would
allow
to
see
her
in
hospital
You
know
how
particular
she
was
about
dyeing
her
hair
She
wouldn't
allow
anyone
else
to
do
it
and
of
course
with
her
broken
arm
after
the
fall
she
couldn't
She
kept
saying
Oh
the
nurses
don't
matter
and
the
doctors
are
afraid
of
me
I'll
do
it
before
I
come
out
Actually
I
preferred
her
with
white
hair
Oh
I
agree
After
all
she
was
seventy-five
It
was
about
time
But
it
was
still
a
shock
to
see
her
like
that
looking
so
old
and
spent
Constance
hadn't
seen
her
mother
since
her
last
visit
to
England
over
a
year
ago
She
had
been
so
busy
with
her
dress
house
in
Rome
coping
with
her
designer
planning
for
the
future
and
ensuring
that
everyone
in
the
business
was
kept
happy
each
of
which
seemed
a
full-time
job
in
itself
that
she
had
hardly
had
time
to
spare
for
her
three
children
let
alone
her
mother
Thinking
now
of
the
battles
she
had
fought
with
her
own
children
especially
her
daughter
Margharita
she
felt
a
pang
of
remorse
over
the
woman
she
had
buried
a
few
hours
earlier
Constance
had
also
fought
her
mother
all
the
way
when
she
was
young
and
her
personality
was
still
forming
and
then
had
somehow
abandoned
her
in
later
life
when
the
need
to
fight
had
gone
She
felt
guilty
but
she
could
say
with
a
clear
conscience
that
her
business
was
so
demanding
that
she
hardly
had
time
to
think
of
Northumberland
although
in
truth
as
her
successes
and
problems
in
Italy
had
increased
there
seemed
less
and
less
reason
to
return
to
Nora
Her
trips
to
see
her
mother
had
of
necessity
been
brief
After
two
days
even
the
smallest
decision
could
become
an
exhausting
battle
of
wills
The
less
they
saw
of
each
other
Constance
had
reluctantly
accepted
over
the
years
the
better
friends
she
and
her
mother
were
She
wasn't
an
easy
character
to
love
you
know
she
went
on
Nora
was
admirable
in
many
ways
but
no
one
could
call
her
lovable
Louise
frowned
impatiently
as
Constance
said
I
suppose
she
lacked
the
maternal
instinct
Rather
like
me
really
She
paused
In
fact
she
murmured
she
wasn't
easy
at
all
any
more
than
I
am
You
never
really
knew
her
Louise
replied
You're
right
Constance
agreed
It's
terribly
sad
but
I
don't
think
I
ever
really
loved
her
either
She
wouldn't
let
me
somehow
I
needed
to
when
I
was
a
teenager
I
had
to
face
all
my
problems
alone
She'd
let
me
get
half-way
close
and
then
she
would
push
me
away
I
always
felt
that
she
cut
me
off
just
as
we
were
becoming
closer
and
always
when
I
most
needed
her
Louise
smiled
That's
exactly
what
she
used
to
say
about
you
She
always
felt
that
Miss
Hatherby
meant
more
to
you
than
she
did
Miss
Hatherby
certainly
influenced
me
but
not
as
a
mother
would
She
was
all
intellect
I
needed
emotional
support
No
Louise
no
matter
what
you
say
Nora
kept
me
at
arm's
length
As
Constance
poured
another
glass
of
sherry
for
her
aunt
Louise
continued
in
a
softer
voice
I
was
the
only
one
who
really
knew
Nora
I
could
always
tell
what
she
was
thinking
When
she
was
first
married
I
was
the
only
person
she
could
turn
to
Your
father
was
such
a
disappointment
to
her
in
so
many
ways
He
had
no
imagination
Poor
Will
he
was
the
archetypal
country
doctor
So
dull
Dull
as
his
name
He
never
had
an
original
idea
in
his
life
You
can't
blame
him
that's
why
he
was
a
country
doctor
They're
meant
to
be
dull
It
isn't
in
the
nature
of
doctors
to
be
original
or
witty
or
anything
They
have
to
be
reliable
reliably
boring
He
was
certainly
that
Why
they
ever
married
I
shall
never
know
I
suppose
she
saw
him
as
an
escape
Louise
lit
another
cigarette
Nora
hated
work
She
had
no
money
when
she
came
from
India
except
for
a
little
in
bonds
or
something
but
not
enough
to
live
on
My
father
had
managed
to
get
her
a
job
in
a
friend's
office
just
off
Hatton
Garden
Not
much
money
but
things
were
different
in
the
twenties
We
didn't
seem
to
need
so
much
in
those
days
Of
course
Nora
felt
being
a
typist
was
below
her
and
she
couldn't
bear
the
people
she
worked
with
She
was
determined
to
get
married
and
get
out
In
those
days
married
women
didn't
work
so
for
her
it
was
the
ideal
solution
She
wouldn't
have
to
be
dependent
on
my
father
any
more
and
she
would
be
free
to
live
her
own
life
Work
bored
her
it
was
too
predictable
Your
mother
had
an
amazing
imagination
that's
where
yours
comes
from
she
could
have
done
so
much
better
with
her
life
Anyhow
the
problem
was
that
we
hardly
ever
saw
any
young
men
so
how
on
earth
could
she
start
courting
Of
course
being
the
determined
woman
she
was
Nora
decided
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
organise
things
for
herself
We
used
to
sit
in
the
garden
for
hours
going
over
her
various
plans
to
get
married
She
had
a
new
one
virtually
every
day
I
just
listened
there
was
absolutely
no
possibility
of
influencing
her
I
remember
thinking
how
typical
it
was
of
her
that
she
never
thought
of
being
wooed
She
was
like
a
huntress
in
pursuit
in
charge
She
always
was
Constance
murmured
to
herself
She
got
the
idea
from
a
magazine
story
of
all
things
Louise
continued
warming
to
the
tale
She
decided
to
go
to
a
hotel
a
grand
one
and
meet
a
man
You
can't
imagine
how
bold
that
was
in
those
days
She
decided
against
seaside
hotels
like
the
Metropole
at
Folkestone
or
the
Imperial
at
Torquay
She
was
shrewd
and
quite
calculating
even
then
She
felt
there
would
be
too
many
families
at
the
seaside
and
not
enough
single
men
She
wanted
a
masculine
sort
of
hotel
So
she
chose
Gleneagles
in
Scotland
which
was
very
new
then
but
already
famous
for
golf
Nora
calculated
that
there
must
be
lots
of
single
men
up
there
so
she
decided
it
was
ideal
for
the
manhunt
as
we
called
it
even
though
the
train
fare
was
a
serious
consideration
I
remember
we
went
up
to
Euston
together
one
Saturday
morning
very
excited
to
buy
the
ticket
in
advance
It
was
a
secret
if
my
parents
had
known
she
was
going
away
alone
they
would
have
soon
put
the
kybosh
on
it
No
she
was
supposed
to
be
going
to
stay
with
a
girlfriend
from
the
India
days
who
lived
in
Perthshire
Your
mother
was
always
good
with
money
that's
who
you
get
it
from
Will
hadn't
a
clue
he
couldn't
have
cared
less!
She
worked
the
whole
trip
out
to
the
last
farthing
I
remember
it
vividly
A
room
without
a
bath
was
forty
shillings
a
night
Gleneagles
was
ridiculously
expensive
in
those
days
still
is
probably
I
remember
Nora's
first
postcard
which
she
sent
in
an
envelope
secretly
to
my
office
She
was
so
indignant
Breakfast
cost
five
shillings
and
dinner
I
think
about
nine
but
she
knew
that
before
she
went
What
infuriated
her
was
that
they
charged
three
shillings
for
afternoon
tea
so
she
decided
to
forgo
it
because
she
knew
the
men
would
still
be
out
on
the
links
Louise
chuckled
at
the
recollection
We
had
a
terrible
check
at
Euston
We
had
to
decide
on
travelling
third
or
first
class
I'd
have
just
gone
third
but
Nora
looked
ahead
She
was
worried
about
coming
back
Going
up
to
Scotland
no
one
would
know
her
so
she
could
travel
third
but
coming
back
if
the
young
man
travelled
with
her
it
never
even
entered
her
head
that
she
wouldn't
meet
one
it
could
be
embarrassing
It
took
us
two
turns
through
the
arch
before
she
decided
First-class
return
it
would
be
I
remember
her
saying
slightly
on
the
defensive
It's
an
investment
and
I
thought
It's
made
her
even
more
determined
to
succeed
Money
always
did
that
with
your
mother
Your
father
had
only
qualified
from
Edinburgh
a
couple
of
years
before
He
was
the
assistant
doctor
for
the
hotel
although
a
lot
of
guests
brought
their
own
in
those
days
Well
you've
heard
the
story
of
how
your
mother
got
soaked
on
the
third
tee
in
a
downpour
Of
course
she
wouldn't
abandon
the
round
You
know
why
It
was
Saturday
so
they
had
put
up
the
green
fee
from
four
and
sixpence
to
seven
and
six
and
she
couldn't
bear
to
waste
the
money
She'd
rather
have
caught
pneumonia
and
died
As
it
was
she
went
down
so
badly
with
flu
that
she
had
to
be
confined
to
her
room
for
the
duration
She
was
furious
No
wonder
she
was
running
a
temperature!
I'm
sure
most
of
it
was
caused
by
temper
That's
when
your
father
came
in
Louise
chuckled
I
remember
her
card
I
am
being
very
attentively
cared
for
by
the
hotel
doctor
William
Simpson
When
he
proposed
to
her
on
the
last
night
I
think
she
took
him
because
having
been
in
her
room
for
seven
days
she'd
met
nobody
else
and
couldn't
bear
to
see
her
investment
wasted

unknown
Aw
lass
What
have
y'been
and
gone
and
done
Promised
to
marry
that
fellow!
The
look
on
her
face
made
me
squirm
and
I
turned
my
head
away
and
walked
to
the
fire
and
held
out
my
hands
towards
it
And
then
she
said
not
intending
to
cause
me
any
pain
but
nevertheless
doing
so
Lass
if
he's
proposed
to
you
he's
after
something
and
it
isn't
far
to
look
It's
your
house
and
all
the
fine
bits
that's
in
it
and
your
nest-egg
I'm
sorry
to
say
this
but
he's
the
type
that
man
and
his
sister
an
all
who
don't
do
things
without
a
motive
like
Aw
don't
be
upset
lass
I
mean
it
kindly
I
I
think
too
much
of
you
You're
like
me
own
and
I
don't
want
to
see
you
makin
a
mistake
I
turned
to
her
blinking
the
tears
from
my
eyes
as
I
said
I
won't
get
the
chance
to
make
many
mistakes
Gran
not
me
All
right
it
might
be
a
mistake
but
I've
got
to
take
it
I
watched
her
sit
down
on
the
couch
with
a
plop
then
bend
forward
and
start
picking
at
it
as
if
she
were
pulling
at
the
threads
and
as
she
did
so
she
muttered
Eeh!
I
wish
our
Georgie
was
here
He'd
know
what
to
do
Gran
I
sat
down
beside
her
and
took
her
hand
I'm
going
to
marry
Howard
I
know
you
won't
be
the
only
one
who'll
think
he
had
ulterior
motives
in
asking
me
but
over
the
past
months
I've
got
to
know
him
and
I
think
he'll
make
a
good
companion
Oh
to
hell
with
that
lass!
She
threw
my
hands
off
her
Bugger
companions!
That's
not
what
you
want
out
of
marriage
at
your
time
of
life
That's
all
right
for
the
old
uns
Even
me
you
wouldn't
get
me
at
this
stage
taking
anybody
just
for
a
companion
Don't
you
know
what
it's
all
about
Yes
I
said
I
know
what
it's
all
about
Well
then
all
I
can
say
is
if
you
do
you're
a
bloody
fool
to
go
on
with
it
Companionship!
she
snorted
then
rose
from
the
couch
and
went
into
the
kitchen
I'd
said
I
knew
what
it
was
all
about
But
what
did
I
know
all
about
Quite
candidly
I
knew
nothing
about
marriage
except
what
I'd
read
in
the
romantic
books
There
had
been
no
whispered
conversations
in
corners
with
other
girls
for
me
there
had
been
no
innuendoes
no
hints
that
I
could
pick
up
and
dissect
Katie
hadn't
been
like
that
And
she
was
married
and
she
would
know
all
about
it
now
But
she
must
have
been
unhappy
for
she
had
left
her
husband
If
we
had
still
been
friends
we
might
have
talked
I
hadn't
understood
Katie's
changed
attitude
towards
me
nor
her
mother's
not
at
that
time
anyway
It
was
her
father
who
explained
it
to
me
I
met
him
in
the
street
one
day
when
he
was
very
drunk
He
had
doted
on
Katie
and
so
he
was
very
bitter
about
this
and
he
said
to
me
Life's
funny
Maisie
Aye
it's
funny
The
wife
was
against
you
and
my
lass
being
pally
because
she
thought
it
would
spoil
Katie's
chances
you
being
as
you
were
then
She
thought
Katie
wouldn't
be
able
to
meet
any
suitable
fellow
if
you
were
along
and
who
did
she
meet
That
rotter
I
never
liked
him
not
from
the
word
go
But
here's
you
now
comfortably
settled
in
your
own
house
And
you've
filled
out
a
lot
you've
changed
And
what
is
our
Katie's
life
Two
bairns
and
separated
from
her
husband
Life's
a
puzzle
Maisie
life's
a
puzzle
I
remember
at
that
time
I
too
thought
it
was
a
puzzle
and
how
wrong
he
had
been
in
thinking
I
was
changed
But
here
I
was
at
Gran's
and
she
was
dead
set
against
my
marrying
Howard
Yet
I
knew
firmly
in
my
own
mind
that
I
would
go
through
with
it
Katie
and
her
unsuccessful
marriage
were
far
removed
from
my
mind
Perhaps
it
was
she
who
sent
Father
Mackin
to
the
house
thinking
that
if
I
was
set
on
going
through
with
it
then
it
should
be
done
properly
Anyway
there
he
was
one
day
when
I
answered
the
door
bell
cheery
and
chatty
but
both
these
facets
of
his
character
hiding
a
deep
purpose
As
he
once
said
to
me
there
were
different
ways
of
driving
a
cuddy
into
the
Catholic
Church
And
he
might
have
succeeded
if
it
hadn't
been
for
Howard
Now
this
is
a
nice
house
Father
Mackin
said
Oh
dear
me
what
a
surprise
And
he
looked
around
the
hall
and
through
the
open
door
into
the
kitchen
The
ceiling
had
imitation
rafters
and
the
units
were
all
scrubbed
oak
My
mother
had
had
them
specially
fitted
Then
laying
his
hat
down
on
the
hallstand
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
he
said
Tis
nippy
outside
It
is
that
very
nippy
Would
you
like
a
cup
of
tea
Father
Now
whoever
said
no
to
a
question
like
that
Yes
I
would
indeed
I
would
love
a
cup
of
tea
What
is
your
first
name
again
Maisie
Oh...Maisie
It's
a
very
friendly
name
that
Maisie
Yes
Maisie
I
would
love
a
cup
of
tea
May
I
go
and
sit
down
he
said
already
walking
towards
the
sitting-room
door
This
was
half
open
and
I
pushed
it
wide
and
he
entered
exclaiming
loudly
Well
whoever
did
this
had
taste
grey
walls
and
a
blue
carpet
and
those
dull
pink
curtains
Now
who
would
ever
think
about
those
colours
combining
into
such
harmony
Tis
a
lovely
house
Have
you
been
here
long
I
was
born
here
and
my
mother
too
My
grandparents
came
into
it
when
it
was
first
built
but
since
then
there's
been
a
lot
of
alteration
done
Well
now
he
sank
on
to
the
couch
if
I
lived
in
a
place
like
this
the
church
would
get
the
go-by
I'd
promise
you
that
I
went
out
laughing
and
hurriedly
made
a
tray
of
tea
And
when
I
returned
to
the
room
he
was
examining
some
pieces
of
china
in
the
cabinet
that
stood
between
the
windows
You
don't
mind
me
being
nosey
do
you
No
Father
not
at
all
These
are
nice
pieces
I
know
something
about
porcelain
and
I
can
say
these
are
nice
pieces
I
understand
my
grandfather
brought
them
from
abroad
Yes
he
would
do
he
would
do
He
sat
down
on
the
couch
once
more
and
I
poured
out
the
tea
and
handed
him
a
plate
on
which
there
were
some
scones
and
after
biting
into
one
he
exclaimed
loudly
on
its
merits
But
I
had
to
tell
him
that
I
hadn't
baked
them
that
a
friend
of
mine
along
the
terrace
was
a
very
good
cook
she
had
done
them
Now
then
if
she
can
bake
scones
like
this
I
bet
she's
not
single
There
you're
wrong
Father
she
is
And
she
is
soon
to
be
my
sister-in-law
Oh
yes
Yes--
he
put
his
cup
down
on
the
side
table
wiped
his
mouth
with
a
coloured
handkerchief
then
said
I
heard
that
you're
to
be
married
And
really
to
tell
the
truth
because
I
must
do
that
sometime
mustn't
I
he
grinned
at
me
that's
partly
why
I've
come
to
see
what
arrangements
you
are
going
to
make
for
the
wedding
Oh
Father
I
made
to
rise
from
the
couch
but
his
hand
stopped
me
and
he
said
Now
it's
all
right
It's
all
right
Don't
take
off
in
a
balloon
I
know
that
you're
not
in
the
church
yet
but
I've
got
a
strong
feeling
that
you
would
like
to
be
I
understand
you
used
to
come
to
mass
with
your
stepfather
at
one
time
so
as
I
see
it
just
a
little
push
and
you'd
be
over
the
step
I'm
sorry
Father
but
my
fianc
is
not
that
way
inclined
at
all
What
do
you
mean
He's
an
atheist
he
doesn't
believe
in
either
God
or
man
No
Well
I
think
if
he's
anything
he's
Church
of
England
But
at
present
he's
nothing
I'm
not
really
sure
We
haven't
discussed
it
Well
then
if
you
haven't
discussed
it
perhaps
he
and
I
can
get
down
to
a
little
natter
eh
No
Father
please
He
has
already
suggested
we
get
married
in
the
registry
office
Oh
now
now
The
smile
went
from
his
face
Registry
office
For
a
moment
I
thought
he
was
going
to
spit
Then
someone
did
spit
Sitting
behind
him
just
to
the
right
there
was
Hamilton
I
gasped
because
I
hadn't
seen
him
for
some
long
time
now
His
head
was
turned
and
he
was
looking
towards
the
floor
and
then
he
brought
his
big
lips
into
a
pout
and
he
spat
And
then
I
heard
myself
say
Oh
dear
me
Now
now
there's
no
need
for
you
to
get
worried
But
I
maintain
that
a
registry
office
marriage
is
no
marriage
not
in
the
eyes
of
the
Headmaster
The
Headmaster
Father
Mackin
now
turned
his
eyes
upward
until
little
but
the
whites
of
them
could
be
seen
and
his
voice
lowered
he
added
Aye
the
Headmaster
the
Headmaster
of
men
He
was
referring
to
God
as
the
Headmaster
of
men
and
I
heard
myself
saying
almost
skittishly
now
And
what
about
women
Father
Oh
he
put
his
head
back
and
laughed
that's
good
that
is
that's
good
Well
it's
a
mixed
school
A...ha!
He
was
leaning
towards
me
now
his
head
bobbing
and
he
repeated
A
mixed
school
And
there's
coloureds
in
it
too
yes
coloureds
blacks
and
browns
and
yellows
and
a
few
Red
Indians
if
I'm
not
mistaken
We
were
both
laughing
now
and
I
wasn't
looking
at
him
I
was
looking
towards
Hamilton
and
he
was
mimicking
me
His
big
mouth
wide
open
his
lips
baring
his
teeth
he
was
doing
a
horse
ha!ha!ha!
bit
I
could
see
that
he
didn't
dislike
the
priest
but
that
at
the
same
time
he
had
taken
his
measure
the
iron
hand
in
the
velvet
glove
so
to
speak
with
a
dusting
of
laughing
gas
inside
it
I
don't
know
what
made
me
think
of
that
bit
except
that
up
in
the
attic
I
had
come
across
a
glove
tree
It
was
in
its
own
box
with
a
canister
of
dusting
powder
it
must
have
been
used
by
my
grandparents
at
some
stage
He
had
three
cups
of
tea
and
four
scones
and
when
he
took
his
leave
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
his
face
and
voice
devoid
of
all
laughter
now
he
said
Think
seriously
on
this
Maisie
It's
a
big
step
and
it's
for
life
Never
take
marriage
lightly
It's
for
life
How
often
I
was
to
think
of
those
words
in
the
years
to
come
it's
for
life

I
put
Chuck
on
the
plane
at
nine
the
next
morning
and
I
sang
the
whole
way
down
from
the
plateau
honking
the
horn
of
my
battered
old
Ford
pick-up
at
the
island
girls
working
in
the
pineapple
fields
They
straightened
up
with
big
flashing
smiles
under
the
brims
of
the
wide
straw
hats
and
waved
At
Coker's
Travel
Agency
I
changed
Chuck's
American
Express
traveller's
cheques
haggling
the
rate
of
exchange
with
Fred
Coker
He
was
in
full
fig
tailcoat
and
black
tie
He
had
a
funeral
at
noon
The
camera
and
tripod
laid
up
for
the
present
photographer
became
undertaker
Coker's
Funeral
Parlour
was
in
the
back
of
the
Travel
Agency
opening
into
the
alley
and
Fred
used
the
hearse
to
pick
up
tourists
at
the
airport
first
discreetly
changing
his
advertising
board
on
the
vehicle
and
putting
the
seats
in
over
the
rail
for
the
coffins
I
booked
all
my
charters
through
him
and
he
clouted
his
ten
percent
off
my
traveller's
cheques
He
had
the
insurance
agency
as
well
and
he
deducted
the
annual
premium
for
Dancer
before
carefully
counting
out
the
balance
I
recounted
just
as
carefully
for
although
Fred
looks
like
a
schoolmaster
tall
and
thin
and
prim
with
just
enough
island
blood
to
give
him
a
healthy
all-over
tan
he
knows
every
trick
in
the
book
and
a
few
which
have
not
been
written
down
yet
He
waited
patiently
while
I
checked
taking
no
offence
and
when
I
stuffed
the
roll
into
my
back
pocket
his
gold
pince-nez
sparkled
and
he
told
me
like
a
loving
father
Don't
forget
you
have
a
charter
party
coming
in
tomorrow
Mister
Harry
That's
all
right
Mr
Coker
don't
you
worry
my
crew
will
be
just
fine
They
are
down
at
the
Lord
Nelson
already
he
told
me
delicately
Fred
keeps
his
finger
firmly
on
the
island's
pulse
Mr
Coker
I'm
running
a
charter
boat
not
a
temperance
society
Don't
worry
I
repeated
and
stood
up
Nobody
ever
died
of
a
hangover
I
crossed
Drake
Street
to
Edward's
Store
and
a
hero's
welcome
Ma
Eddy
herself
came
out
from
behind
the
counter
and
folded
me
into
her
warm
pneumatic
bosom
Mister
Harry
she
cooed
and
bussed
me
I
went
down
to
the
wharf
to
see
the
fish
you
hung
yesterday
Then
she
turned
still
holding
me
and
shouted
at
one
of
her
counter
girls
Shirley
you
get
Mister
Harry
a
nice
cold
beer
now
hear
I
hauled
out
my
roll
The
pretty
little
island
girls
chittered
like
sparrows
when
they
saw
it
and
Ma
Eddy
rolled
her
eyes
and
hugged
me
closer
What
do
I
owe
you
Missus
Eddy
From
June
to
November
is
a
long
off-season
when
the
fish
do
not
run
and
Ma
Eddy
carries
me
through
that
lean
time
I
propped
myself
against
the
counter
with
a
can
of
beer
in
my
hand
picking
the
goods
I
needed
from
the
shelves
and
watching
their
legs
as
the
girls
in
their
mini-skirts
clambered
up
the
ladders
to
fetch
them
down
old
Harry
feeling
pretty
good
and
cocky
with
that
hard
lump
of
green
stuff
in
his
back
pocket
Then
I
went
down
to
the
Shell
Company
basin
and
the
manager
met
me
at
the
door
of
his
office
between
the
big
silver
fuel
storage
tanks
God
Harry
I've
been
waiting
for
you
all
morning
Head
Office
has
been
screaming
at
me
about
your
bill
Your
waiting
is
over
brother
I
told
him
But
Wave
Dancer
like
most
beautiful
women
is
an
expensive
mistress
and
when
I
climbed
back
into
the
pick-up
the
lump
in
my
pocket
was
severely
depleted
They
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
beer
garden
of
the
Lord
Nelson
The
island
is
very
proud
of
its
associations
with
the
Royal
Navy
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
no
longer
a
British
possession
but
revels
in
an
independence
of
six
years
standing
yet
for
two
hundred
years
previously
it
had
been
a
station
of
the
British
fleet
Old
prints
by
long-dead
artists
decorated
the
public
bar
depicting
the
great
ships
beating
up
the
channel
of
lying
in
grand
harbour
alongside
Admiralty
Wharf
men-of-war
and
merchantmen
of
John
Company
victualled
and
refitted
here
before
the
long
run
south
to
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
and
the
Atlantic
St
Mary's
has
never
forgotten
her
place
in
history
nor
the
admirals
and
mighty
ships
that
made
their
landfall
here
The
Lord
Nelson
is
a
parody
of
its
former
grandeur
but
I
enjoy
its
decayed
and
seedy
elegance
and
its
associations
with
the
past
more
than
the
tower
of
glass
and
concrete
that
Hilton
has
erected
on
the
headland
above
the
harbour
Chubby
and
his
wife
sat
side
by
side
on
the
bench
against
the
far
wall
both
of
them
in
their
Sunday
clothes
This
was
the
easiest
way
to
tell
them
apart
the
fact
that
Chubby
wore
the
three-piece
suit
which
he
had
bought
for
his
wedding
the
buttons
straining
and
gaping
and
the
deep-sea
cap
stained
with
salt
crystals
and
fish
blood
on
his
head
while
his
wife
wore
a
full-length
black
dress
of
heavy
wool
faded
greenish
with
age
and
black
button-up
boots
beneath
Otherwise
their
dark
mahogany
faces
were
almost
identical
though
Chubby
was
freshly
shaven
and
she
did
have
a
light
moustache
Hello
Missus
Chubby
how
are
you
I
asked
Thank
you
Mister
Harry
Will
you
take
a
little
something
then
Perhaps
just
a
little
orange
gin
Mister
Harry
with
a
small
bitter
to
chase
it
down
While
she
sipped
the
sweet
liquor
I
counted
Chubby's
wages
into
her
hand
and
her
lips
moved
as
she
counted
silently
in
chorus
Chubby
watched
anxiously
and
I
wondered
once
again
how
he
had
managed
all
these
years
to
fool
her
on
the
billfish
bonus
Missus
Chubby
drained
the
beer
and
the
froth
emphasized
her
moustache
I'll
be
off
then
Mister
Harry
She
rose
majestically
and
sailed
from
the
courtyard
I
waited
until
she
turned
into
Frobisher
Street
before
I
slipped
Chubby
the
little
sheath
of
notes
under
the
table
and
we
went
into
the
private
bar
together
Angelo
had
a
girl
on
each
side
of
him
and
one
on
his
lap
His
black
silk
shirt
was
open
to
the
belt
buckle
exposing
gleaming
chest
muscles
His
denim
pants
fitted
skin-tight
leaving
no
doubt
as
to
his
gender
and
his
boots
were
hand-tooled
and
polished
westerns
He
had
greased
his
hair
and
sleeked
it
back
in
the
style
of
the
young
Presley
He
flashed
his
grin
like
a
stage
lamp
across
the
rook
and
when
I
paid
him
he
tucked
a
banknote
into
the
front
of
each
girl's
blouse
Hey
Eleanor
you
go
sit
on
Harry's
lap
but
careful
now
Harry's
a
virgin
you
treat
him
right
hear
He
roared
with
delighted
laughter
and
turned
to
Chubby
Hey
Chubby
you
quit
giggling
like
that
all
the
time
man!
That's
stupid
all
that
giggling
and
grinning
Chubby's
frown
deepened
his
whole
face
crumpling
into
folds
and
wrinkles
like
that
of
a
bulldog
Hey
Mister
barman
you
give
old
Chubby
a
drink
now
Perhaps
that
will
stop
him
cutting
up
stupid
giggling
like
that
At
four
that
afternoon
Angelo
had
driven
his
girls
off
and
he
sat
with
his
glass
on
the
table
top
before
him
Beside
it
lay
his
bait
knife
honed
to
a
razor
edge
and
glinting
evilly
in
the
overhead
lights
He
muttered
darkly
to
himself
deep
in
alcoholic
melancholy
Every
few
minutes
he
would
test
the
edge
of
the
knife
with
his
thumb
and
scowl
around
the
room
Nobody
took
any
notice
of
him
Chubby
sat
on
the
other
side
of
me
grinning
like
a
great
brown
toad
exposing
a
set
of
huge
startlingly
white
teeth
with
pink
plastic
gums
Harry
he
told
me
expansively
one
thick
muscled
arm
around
my
neck
You
are
a
good
boy
Harry
You
know
what
Harry
I'm
going
to
tell
you
now
what
I
never
told
you
before
He
nodded
wisely
as
he
gathered
himself
for
the
declaration
he
made
every
pay
day
Harry
I
love
you
man
I
love
you
better
than
my
own
brother
I
lifted
the
stained
cap
and
lightly
caressed
the
bald
brown
dome
of
his
head
And
you
are
my
favourite
eggshell
blond
I
told
him
He
held
me
at
arm's
length
for
a
moment
studying
my
face
then
burst
into
a
lion's
roar
of
laughter
It
was
completely
infectious
and
we
were
both
still
laughing
when
Fred
Coker
walked
in
and
sat
down
at
the
table
He
adjusted
his
pince-nez
and
said
primly
Mister
Harry
I
have
just
received
a
special
delivery
from
London
Your
charter
cancelled
I
stopped
laughing
What
the
hell!
I
said
Two
weeks
without
a
charter
in
the
middle
of
high
season
and
only
a
lousy
two-hundred-dollar
reservation
fee
Mr
Coker
you
have
got
to
get
me
a
party
I
had
three
hundred
dollars
left
in
my
pocket
from
Chuck's
Charter
You
got
to
get
me
a
party
I
repeated
and
Angelo
picked
up
his
knife
and
with
a
crash
drove
the
point
deeply
into
the
table
top
Nobody
took
any
notice
of
him
and
he
scowled
angrily
around
the
room
I'll
try
said
Fred
Coker
but
it's
a
bit
late
now
Cable
the
parties
we
had
to
turn
down
Who
will
pay
for
the
cables
Fred
asked
delicately
The
hell
with
it
I'll
pay
And
he
nodded
and
went
out
I
heard
the
hearse
start
up
outside
Don't
worry
Harry
said
Chubby
I
still
love
you
man
Suddenly
beside
me
Angelo
went
to
sleep
He
fell
forward
and
his
forehead
hit
the
table
top
with
a
resounding
crack
I
rolled
his
head
so
that
he
would
not
drown
in
the
puddle
of
spilled
liquor
returned
the
knife
to
its
sheath
and
took
charge
of
his
bank
roll
to
protect
him
from
the
girls
who
were
hovering
close
Chubby
ordered
another
round
and
began
to
sing
a
rambling
mumbling
shanty
in
island
patois
while
I
sat
and
worried
Once
again
I
was
stretched
out
neatly
on
the
financial
rack
God
How
I
hate
money
or
rather
the
lack
of
it
Those
two
weeks
would
make
all
the
difference
as
to
whether
or
not
Dancer
and
I
could
survive
the
off-season
and
still
keep
our
good
resolutions
I
knew
we
couldn't
I
knew
we
would
have
to
go
on
the
night
run
again
The
hell
with
it
if
we
had
to
do
it
we
might
as
well
do
it
now
I
would
pass
the
word
that
Harry
was
ready
to
do
a
deal
Having
made
the
decision
I
felt
again
that
pleasurable
tightening
of
the
nerves
the
gut
thing
that
goes
with
danger
The
two
weeks
of
cancelled
time
might
not
be
wasted
after
all
I
joined
Chubby
in
song
not
entirely
certain
that
we
were
singing
the
same
number
for
I
seemed
to
reach
the
end
of
each
chorus
a
long
time
before
Chubby
It
was
probably
his
musical
feast
that
called
up
the
law
On
St
Mary's
this
takes
the
form
of
an
Inspector
and
four
troopers
which
is
more
than
adequate
for
the
island
Apart
from
a
good
deal
of
carnal
knowledge
under
the
age
of
consent
and
a
little
wife-beating
there
is
no
crime
worthy
of
the
name
Inspector
Peter
Daly
was
a
young
man
with
a
blond
moustache
a
high
English
colour
on
smooth
cheeks
and
pale
blue
eyes
set
close
together
like
those
of
a
sewer
rat
He
wore
the
uniform
of
the
British
colonial
police
the
cap
with
the
silver
badge
and
shiny
patent
leather
peak
the
khaki
drill
starched
and
ironed
until
it
crackled
softly
as
he
walked
the
polished
leather
belt
and
Sam
Browne
cross-straps
He
carried
a
malacca
cane
swagger
stick
which
was
also
covered
with
polished
leather
Except
for
the
green
and
yellow
St
Mary's
shoulder
flashes
he
looked
like
the
Empire's
pride
but
like
the
Empire
the
men
who
wore
the
uniform
had
also
crumbled
Mr
Fletcher
he
said
standing
over
our
table
and
slapping
the
swagger
stick
lightly
against
his
palm
I
hope
we
are
not
going
to
have
any
trouble
tonight

THE
HEADLAND
SLOPED
in
a
hollow
curve
to
the
sea
and
at
its
very
crest
raised
on
an
inclined
plane
like
the
launching
ramp
of
a
ship
was
the
Wheel
It
stood
within
a
ring
of
hissing
pressure
lamps
which
kept
the
darkness
at
bay
An
elaborate
framework
of
twisted
osiers
the
Wheel
was
nine
feet
in
diameter
with
the
proportions
of
a
water-wheel
but
lit
by
the
lamps
and
raised
aloft
as
it
was
it
looked
gigantic
The
osiers
were
almost
hidden
by
plaited
straw
and
by
interlacing
branches
of
yew
and
laurel
coloured
streamers
attached
to
the
rim
hung
limply
on
the
still
air
and
within
the
Wheel
in
a
bower
of
straw
and
foliage
was
a
life-size
figure
wearing
a
grotesque
mask
and
enveloped
in
a
black
cloak
Here
was
the
embodiment
of
evil
the
Scapegoat
and
with
his
imminent
destruction
wickedness
would
be
symbolically
cast
out
and
the
townspeople
would
be
once
more
on
the
side
of
the
angels
They
were
out
in
strength
a
milling
crowd
grouping
and
regrouping
like
ants
disturbed
Children
who
bravely
ventured
into
the
darkness
soon
came
scampering
back
It
was
October
st
All-Hallows
Eve
and
only
credit
balances
in
several
hundred
bank
accounts
recalled
summer
visitors
who
had
swarmed
over
the
streets
and
beaches
and
cliffs
between
June
and
September
The
town
had
settled
to
being
itself
again
sleepy
clannish
introverted
In
a
little
while
the
Wheel
would
be
set
alight
released
from
its
cradle
and
allowed
to
trundle
down
the
slope
gathering
momentum
Thunder
flashes
Roman
candles
and
other
pyrotechnics
would
enliven
its
passage
until
a
spinning
hoop
of
flame
it
launched
itself
over
the
cliff
described
a
brief
trajectory
and
plunged
into
the
sea
never
to
be
seen
again
At
least
that
was
the
theory
Most
years
it
was
washed
up
again
on
the
next
or
a
later
tide
but
this
was
of
no
consequence
so
long
as
the
Scapegoat
had
gone
More
seriously
on
one
or
two
occasions
the
Wheel
had
not
reached
the
sea
but
had
left
its
appointed
path
to
run
amok
in
the
gorse
and
heather
starting
fires
Such
mishaps
were
bad
omens
and
though
the
townspeople
maintained
that
they
did
not
take
the
Wheel
seriously
they
were
happier
when
all
went
according
to
plan
For
days
before
Hallowe'en
several
men
devoted
their
spare
time
to
preparing
the
track
the
grass
was
trimmed
weeds
and
stones
removed
hollows
and
gullies
washed
out
by
the
rain
were
filled
and
the
whole
course
was
meticulously
surveyed
for
snags
and
bumps
The
custodianship
of
the
path
had
become
the
prerogative
of
a
few
specialists
with
a
fund
of
empirical
knowledge
which
they
gravely
applied
to
securing
the
smooth
passage
of
the
Wheel
Now
for
safety
the
path
was
roped
off
on
either
side
Detective
Chief
Superintendent
Wycliffe
and
his
wife
Helen
were
to
see
the
spectacle
for
the
first
time
they
were
spending
a
long
weekend
with
the
Ballards
who
lived
on
the
moor
above
the
town
Tony
Ballard
was
a
painter
and
his
wife
Zelah
wrote
historical
novels
Tony
shy
and
introverted
lived
for
his
painting
while
Zelah
seemed
to
live
as
she
wrote
with
an
engaging
panache
It
was
a
mild
night
with
clouds
drifting
across
the
sky
and
occasionally
obscuring
the
new
moon
Out
to
sea
the
beam
of
the
lighthouse
swept
a
great
arc
every
fifteen
seconds
on
one
side
of
the
headland
were
the
lights
of
the
town
and
harbour
on
the
other
it
was
just
possible
to
make
out
a
line
of
cliffs
receding
into
the
darkness
Wycliffe
was
content
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
mackintosh
he
watched
the
crowd
an
occupation
of
which
he
never
tired
People
are
so
much
more
varied
and
interesting
than
birds
or
badgers
or
any
of
the
other
creatures
naturalists
watch
with
such
exemplary
patience
But
Wycliffe's
interest
was
far
from
scientific
he
reached
no
profound
sociological
conclusions
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
be
objective
On
the
contrary
he
was
satisfied
to
feel
that
he
was
sharing
in
other
people's
lives
Teenaged
boys
paraded
in
groups
of
three
or
four
jostling
each
other
laughing
and
shouting
groups
of
girls
on
the
whole
less
brash
and
aggressive
giggled
and
chattered
calling
to
the
boys
whenever
they
were
in
range
Young
couples
strolled
with
their
arms
round
each
other
pausing
now
and
then
to
kiss
older
couples
stopped
to
greet
friends
and
while
the
women
talked
their
husbands
stood
by
looking
foolishly
amiable
A
disembodied
voice
came
over
the
amplifiers
instructing
people
to
move
outside
the
ropes
Let's
find
a
good
place
Tony
where
we
can
see
Opinion
was
divided
over
the
best
place
to
stand
for
if
they
watched
the
launching
they
missed
a
close-up
view
of
the
final
plunge
into
the
sea
Zelah
favoured
the
launching
site
so
that
was
where
they
stood
We
can
take
a
good
look
at
the
Wheel
she
explained
with
embarrassing
stridency
Of
course
originally
it
was
no
effigy
tied
up
in
there
but
a
live
man
a
human
scapegoat
Later
when
people
got
squeamish
about
that
sort
of
thing
they
substituted
cats
a
dozen
or
so
live
cats
tied
up
in
a
sack
Not
that
they
had
anything
against
cats
as
cats
but
witches
were
believed
to
take
the
form
of
cats
so
it
was
all
quite
reasonable
really
Zelah
seemed
to
know
everybody
and
the
Wycliffes
were
introduced
to
a
bewildering
variety
of
people
whom
they
never
expected
to
see
again
An
eerie
blast
on
a
horn
signalled
the
start
of
the
ceremony
and
the
crowd
became
silent
The
master
of
ceremonies
in
a
white
druidical
robe
mounted
the
platform
by
the
launching
ramp
and
stood
peering
inland
along
another
path
marked
off
by
ropes
which
disappeared
into
the
darkness
After
a
while
a
flickering
light
appeared
in
the
distance
and
drew
steadily
nearer
a
torch-bearer
came
into
view
a
girl
wearing
a
long
white
gown
which
left
her
arms
bare
she
carried
aloft
a
burning
torch
which
gave
off
a
great
deal
of
tarry
smoke
She's
supposed
to
be
a
virgin
Zelah
explained
in
a
stage
whisper
but
I
wouldn't
like
to
bet
on
that
one
The
girl
mounted
the
steps
to
stand
beside
the
master
of
ceremonies
and
they
carried
on
a
conversation
which
though
audible
was
unintelligible
They're
speaking
in
Cornish
Zelah
said
He's
asking
her
if
she
has
brought
the
need-fire
and
she
tells
him
that
she
has
He
says
Was
this
flame
kindled
at
the
altar
of
the
Lord
and
she
answers
This
flame
was
kindled
at
the
holy
fire
Actually
she
lights
her
torch
at
one
of
the
candles
in
the
church
and
somebody
runs
her
up
here
in
a
car
while
she
holds
the
torch
out
of
the
window
Of
course
that's
not
how
it's
supposed
to
be
done
The
white-robed
man
took
the
torch
from
the
girl
and
held
it
up
to
the
people
He
said
a
few
words
which
Zelah
translated
as
This
is
the
holy
flame
which
shall
consume
our
wickedness
and
purge
our
people
of
evil
for
the
year
to
come
A
few
people
shouted
the
proper
response
which
sounded
like
Sans!
Sans!
Zelah
said
that
it
meant
Holy!
Holy!
After
that
the
torch
was
applied
to
a
point
on
the
Wheel
and
at
the
same
moment
the
chocks
were
knocked
away
The
Wheel
seemed
to
hesitate
then
it
began
to
roll
very
slowly
Flames
licked
over
the
straw
which
crackled
and
flared
and
the
Wheel
was
clear
of
the
ramp
and
bowling
gently
down
the
cleared
path
The
first
fireworks
exploded
and
the
Wheel
was
almost
enveloped
in
flame
while
the
air
was
filled
with
a
mixture
of
smells
paraffin
sooty
smoke
from
the
straw
and
cordite
from
the
fireworks
The
Scapegoat
appeared
unharmed
and
was
clearly
visible
through
the
curtain
of
fire
turning
over
and
over
as
the
Wheel
rolled
It
began
to
pick
up
speed
and
as
it
did
so
larger
fireworks
were
detonated
so
that
showers
of
sparks
and
clouds
of
coloured
smoke
trailed
behind
like
a
peacock's
tail
green
and
red
and
blue
Faster
and
faster
the
Wheel
trundled
a
whirling
fiery
hoop
until
it
reached
an
artificial
mound
at
the
cliff
edge
and
was
deflected
up
into
the
air
It
sailed
in
a
great
arc
hung
poised
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
then
plunged
out
of
sight
to
the
sea
Even
from
where
the
Wycliffes
stood
the
effect
was
spectacular
Within
seconds
of
the
Wheel
disappearing
from
sight
the
red
glow
was
extinguished
A
spontaneous
cry
arose
from
the
crowd
followed
by
a
moment
of
silence
then
people
began
to
talk
again
A
good
show
this
year
not
a
hitch
After
the
ceremony
of
the
Wheel
there
was
a
firework
display
and
people
bought
chips
and
hot-dogs
from
traders
with
vans
who
were
cashing
in
on
the
occasion
The
sky
which
had
been
clear
and
filled
with
stars
was
clouding
over
and
a
moist
wind
blew
in
from
the
sea
This
smells
like
rain
Zelah
said
We
don't
want
to
be
caught
up
in
the
rush
when
it
comes
She
rounded
up
her
charges
before
the
others
began
to
move
and
willed
them
along
the
path
to
the
car
park
Wycliffe
and
Tony
would
have
preferred
to
linger
to
digest
the
experience
but
they
had
no
choice
They
found
the
Ballards
car
Will
you
drive
Tony
or
shall
l
You
drive
dear
Wycliffe
and
Tony
got
into
the
back
Helen
was
in
front
with
Zelah
In
no
time
at
all
they
were
coasting
down
the
slope
out
of
the
car
park
What
did
you
think
of
it
Very
impressive
Oh
it
was
really
worth
seeing
Good!
You
must
come
again
next
year
and
see
it
from
the
cliff
edge
Zelah
really
meant
what
she
said
she
was
perfectly
sincere
in
making
an
arrangement
for
twelve
months
ahead
never
considering
the
possibilities
of
change
They
reached
the
town
and
drove
through
its
narrow
deserted
streets
then
they
began
the
long
steady
climb
to
the
moor
Tony
did
some
sketches
last
year
and
he
was
going
to
work
them
up
into
a
picture
why
haven't
you
Tony
The
Ballard
house
was
built
into
the
side
of
a
hill
a
long
low
granite
building
which
had
once
been
something
to
do
with
a
mine
Huge
boulders
littered
their
garden
and
gorse
and
heather
encroached
wherever
they
were
permitted
to
survive
The
house
was
reached
by
a
stony
drive
more
than
half-a-mile
long
furrowed
and
rutted
by
the
drainage
from
the
hill
but
they
had
electricity
oil-fired
central
heating
and
no
neighbours
The
living-room
was
long
and
low
with
roof-beams
which
still
bore
marks
of
the
adze
the
fireplace
built
of
rough-hewn
stone
was
phoney
but
acceptable
and
the
walls
were
white
Tony's
Cornish
landscapes
in
frames
of
plain
gilt
looked
well
their
rich
browns
yellows
and
orange
tones
warmed
the
room
and
more
than
balanced
the
white
walls
There
were
bookcases
of
dark
oak
and
a
solitary
shelf
for
Zelah's
own
books
nine
titles
in
different
editions
with
a
sprinkling
of
foreign
imprints
There
was
an
expanse
of
untenanted
shelf
presumably
to
allow
for
future
production
Whisky
Charles
Tony
poured
drinks
The
two
men
were
about
the
same
age
nearing
fifty
both
were
of
the
lean
kind
with
strong
features
and
over-thin
lips
both
were
taciturn
and
found
it
difficult
to
put
ideas
into
words
Of
all
the
friends
with
whom
Helen
had
involved
him
Wycliffe
felt
most
at
ease
with
Tony
Zelah
was
a
cross
to
be
borne
more
or
less
cheerfully
and
Helen
could
handle
her
when
necessary
by
being
devastatingly
blunt
On
such
occasions
Zelah
would
shrug
and
say
Oh
well
if
that's
how
you
want
it
my
child!
At
heart
she
was
a
kindly
woman
Zelah
was
older
than
her
husband
she
had
straight
short
grey
hair
and
a
small
thin
face
which
was
never
in
repose
She
did
everything
with
quick
darting
movements
in
which
violence
was
barely
restrained
When
she
used
her
typewriter
she
seemed
intent
on
hammering
holes
in
the
paper
Wycliffe
was
never
at
ease
in
other
people's
houses
and
not
only
because
he
was
usually
bored
He
had
never
discovered
when
it
was
proper
to
follow
his
host
about
and
when
it
was
politic
to
be
elsewhere
Now
he
sat
by
the
fire
with
his
whisky
a
drink
he
did
not
care
for
making
conversation
with
Tony
and
hoping
that
it
would
soon
be
time
for
bed
Zelah
was
telling
Helen
the
plot
of
her
next
novel
How
long
have
these
fire
festivals
been
going
on
Tony
took
his
time
his
responses
were
always
sluggish
According
to
the
town
guide
they
date
back
to
Celtic
times
I
expect
you
know
that
November
st
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
start
of
the
Celtic
year
They
were
allowed
to
lapse
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
and
were
not
revived
until
after
the
last
war
The
chap
you
saw
in
the
druid
outfit
got
them
going
again
and
he's
still
the
king-pin
Tony
sipped
his
whisky
and
stirred
the
fire
before
going
on
He's
a
strange
chap
he
runs
a
small-holding
on
the
moor
not
far
from
here
His
name
is
Jordan
He
says
that
his
ancestors
came
over
here
from
Brittany
in
the
seventeenth
century
fleeing
from
Catholic
persecution
Tony
smoothed
his
hand
over
his
thinning
hair
I
think
he's
probably
a
bit
mixed
up
in
matters
of
doctrine
but
he
claims
to
be
a
true
protestant
not
as
he
says
a
Lutheran
protestant
His
protest
apparently
goes
back
a
lot
further
to
the
Synod
of
Whitby
when
according
to
him
the
Celtic
Christian
Church
was
sold
down
the
river
to
Rome
Wycliffe
knocked
out
his
pipe
in
the
grate
But
surely
that
show
tonight
can't
have
much
to
do
with
Christianity
Celtic
or
otherwise
Tony
smiled
The
vicar
would
certainly
agree
with
you
but
you
should
talk
to
Jordan
though
not
unless
you
have
half
a
day
to
spare
His
daughter
Cissie
has
just
had
an
illegitimate
baby
Zelah
chimed
in
However
deeply
involved
she
might
be
in
her
own
conversation
she
rarely
missed
anything
that
was
said
by
those
around
her
I
listen
with
my
writer's
ear
she
would
say
It's
our
great
local
mystery
at
the
moment
nobody
knows
who
the
father
is
except
perhaps
Cissie
and
if
she
knows
she's
not
telling

Or
as
they
put
it
in

locker-room
once

in
you're
in
What
happened
that
afternoon
was
the
product
of
countless
details
all
of
which
had
to
be
just
right
If
it
hadn't
been
so
hot
if
there
had
been
no
row
the
night
before
if
Dennis
hadn't
passed
out
if
I'd
fallen
asleep
if
any
of
the
others
had
been
there
if
Karen
had
come
back
later
if
she'd
gone
straight
to
the
pool
rather
than
taken
a
shower
if
any
or
all
of
these
had
been
the
case
then
intercourse
would
not
have
occurred
Once
it
had
though
it
was
relatively
simple
to
convince
Karen
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
inevitable
No
one
likes
to
be
made
to
look
like
a
mere
creature
of
chance
It
was
simply
too
demeaning
to
believe
that
the
experience
we
had
shared
had
been
dependent
on
such
things
as
the
amount
of
booze
Dennis
put
away
that
lunchtime
We
had
to
repossess
what
fate
had
handed
us
on
a
plate
and
the
only
way
to
do
this
was
to
claim
that
we
had
willed
it
all
along
When
I
broke
the
matter
to
Karen
on
the
deck
of
the
ferry
going
home
however
I
sugared
the
locker-room
logic
in
language
more
akin
to
the
elegant
formulas
of
your
illustrious
bard
We
can't
put
the
clock
back
Karen
What's
happened
has
happened
Now
we
know
how
it
feels
to
be
together
fully
how
can
we
be
content
with
anything
less
Thick
Britannic
cloud
massed
overhead
The
Channel
swill
chopped
and
slapped

around
Dennis
and
the
others
were
propping
up
the
bar
Karen
was
supposedly
selecting
duty-free
perfume
No
one
cared
what
I
was
doing
I
know
she
sighed
Karen
Parsons
never
ceased
to
astonish
me
I'd
been
expecting
her
to
put
up
a
stiff
rearguard
action
protesting
that
holidays
were
one
thing
and
everyday
life
another
that
she
had
only
surrendered
to
me
in
a
moment
of
weakness
which
she
would
regret
for
the
rest
of
her
life
and
so
on
and
so
forth
I
was
confident
I
could
wear
her
down
eventually
but
I
certainly
never
expected
her
to
come
across
at
the
first
time
of
asking
But
instead
of
prevaricating
and
procrastinating
she
came
over
all
gooey
stroking
my
hand
and
squeezing
my
arm
and
saying
she
didn't
want
to
lose
me
but
she
was
frightened
frightened
and
confused
she
didn't
know
what
to
do
This
was
a
Karen
I
hadn't
seen
before
and
one
I
didn't
have
much
time
for
to
be
frank
After
my
belated
conversion
from
the
outworn
pieties
of
my
youth
what
I
wanted
from
Karen
was
a
crash
course
in
greed
voracity
cheap
thrills
and
superficial
emotion
What
attracted
me
to
her
was
her
animality
The
last
thing
I
needed
was
her
going
all
human
on
me
Karen
was
a
magnificent
bitch
but
when
she
tried
to
be
human
she
turned
into
a
Disney
puppy
trashy
vulgar
and
sentimental
When
I
kissed
her
she
twisted
against
me
urgently
and
then
I
understood
Actions
not
words
were
the
way
to
Karen's
heart
On
the
level
of
language
she
was
frightened
confused
and
unsure
what
to
do
but
her
body
spoke
loud
and
clear
I
looked
round
There
was
no
one
about
apart
from
a
couple
of
youths
stoning
the
seagulls
with
empty
beer
bottles
I
led
Karen
up
a
narrow
companion-way
marked
Crew
Only
to
a
constricted
quarterdeck
partially
screened
by
the
lifeboats
hanging
from
their
cradles
We
did
it
on
the
sloping
lid
of
a
locker
our
jeans
and
knickers
round
our
ankles
It
was
what
you
might
call
a
duty
fuck
A
pallid
sun
appeared
like
a
nosy
neighbour
spying
from
behind
lace
curtains
The
wind
ricocheted
about
the
deck
raising
goose-bumps
on
our
bare
flesh
A
seagull
on
one
of
the
lifeboats
regarded
us
with
a
voyeur's
eye
It
wasn't
much
fun
but
we
did
it
and
that
was
the
main
thing
Until
we
had
made
love
again
that
first
occasion
at
the
villa
was
in
danger
of
becoming
the
exception
which
proved
the
rule
As
a
unique
event
Karen
could
file
it
away
in
her
snapshot
album
as
one
of
the
interesting
things
that
had
happened
during
her
holiday
in
France
But
as
soon
as
it
was
repeated
its
individuality
merged
into
a
series
extending
indefinitely
into
the
future
By
the
time
we
returned
to
the
bar
Karen's
extramarital
virginity
had
been
lost
beyond
recall
Back
in
Oxford
I
discovered
I
was
not
only
broke
but
unemployed
Clive
Phillips
the
council
estate
dodger
who
had
got
on
his
bike
and
into
the
fast
lane
had
fired
me
Well
he
didn't
need
to
fire
me
Like
all
the
teachers
I
had
a
one-year
contract
renewable
at
Clive's
discretion
which
in
my
case
he
found
himself
unable
to
exercise
I
don't
think
I
can
do
it
is
how
he
put
it
when
I
phoned
him
I
just
don't
think
it's
on
quite
frankly
at
this
particular
point
in
time
The
technical
term
for
the
speech-like
noise
that
babies
produce
before
they
learn
to
talk
is
jargoning
That's
what
I
did
now
The
fact
of
the
matter
is
several
of
the
teachers
on
the
course
you
missed
because
of
skiving
off
on
holiday
a
number
of
them
have
asked
me
if
they
can
stay
on
for
the
autumn
term
Comparisons
are
insidious
I
know
but
I
have
to
say
they're
good
Sharp
hungry
keen
as
mustard
Thatcher's
kids
Make
me
feel
my
age
tell
you
the
truth!
Anyway
what
with
you
not
being
around
and
that
I
felt
constricted
to
give
them
a
crack
of
the
whip
Only
fair
really
You
knew
this
was
going
to
happen
didn't
you
Watch
out!
you
yelled
as
I
set
off
on
holiday
Look
behind
you!
You
saw
it
coming
a
mile
off
I
didn't
I
really
didn't
When
I
put
that
phone
down
I
was
in
tears
I
couldn't
believe
the
universe
could
do
this
to
me
Deep
down
inside
you
see
I
still
believed
that
life
was
basically
benevolent
I
wasn't
naive
enough
to
expect
the
goodies
to
win
every
time
but
over
the
long-haul
and
certainly
in
the
last
reel
I
sort
of
weakly
vaguely
wetly
assumed
that
things
would
come
right
I
should
have
realized
that
Clive
would
dump
me
at
the
first
opportunity
that
he
had
in
fact
been
looking
for
an
excuse
to
do
so
Clive
didn't
want
quality
or
experience
in
his
teachers
Quality
expects
rewards
experience
makes
comparisons
What
Clive
wanted
was
callow
youth
At
such
moments
of
crisis
some
people
resort
to
drink
I
couldn't
afford
drink
so
I
resorted
to
Karen
instead
The
only
advantage
of
being
dumped
by
Clive
was
that
it
made
this
a
lot
simpler
Dennis's
mornings
were
fully
taken
up
meeting
clients
delegating
responsibilities
processing
figures
and
accessing
data
His
afternoons
were
much
less
predictable
and
that
was
also
when
the
bulk
of
Karen's
contact
hours
were
timetabled
So
if
I'd
still
been
giving
Clive
the
best
part
of
my
days
occasions
for
dalliance
would
have
been
rare
and
risky
As
a
gentleman
of
leisure
it
was
a
breeze
Dennis
Parsons
was
blessed
with
behavioural
patterns
which
were
etched
into
his
brain
like
circuits
in
a
microchip
When
it
comes
to
the
detail
of
everyday
life
most
of
us
just
muddle
through
somehow
but
Dennis
was
a
Platonist
When
he
went
to
the
toilet
for
example
his
aim
wasn't
just
any
old
crap
but
the
closest
possible
approximation
in
this
imperfect
world
to
the
Eternal
Idea
of
Dennis-Going-to-the-Toilet
This
had
been
of
something
more
than
philosophical
interest
to
Karen
and
I
in
our
pre-coital
phase
since
it
meant
that
we
could
count
on
at
least
a
minute
thirty
seconds
before
he
reappeared
or
as
much
as
three
minutes
forty-five
seconds
if
we
heard
the
seat
go
down
for
a
big
jobby
Now
we
had
moved
on
to
bigger
and
better
things
this
predictability
still
stood
us
in
good
stead
At
every
weekday
Dennis
went
out
to
fetch
the
BMW
from
the
garage
Exactly
one
minute
later
he
backed
it
out
on
to
the
drive
and
turned
round
Leaving
the
engine
running
he
then
returned
to
the
house
to
collect
his
executive
briefcase
and
other
relevant
impedimenta
At
o'clock
precisely
just
as
the
pips
ended
and
the
news
began
he
got
back
into
the
car
and
drove
off
I
observed
this
routine
the
day
after
I
learned
that
my
services
were
no
longer
required
at
the
Oxford
International
Language
College
and
I
knew
that
barring
an
Act
of
God
I
could
set
my
watch
by
it
thereafter
As
soon
as
Dennis
had
roared
off
towards
the
offices
of
Osiris
Management
Services
I
strolled
down
Ramillies
Drive
to
the
Parsonage
and
rang
the
bell
Karen
came
to
the
door
in
her
dressing-gown
I
pushed
past
her
into
the
hall
and
closed
the
door
behind
us
What
are
you
doing
I
untied
the
belt
of
her
dressing-gown
and
got
my
hands
inside
Don't!
To
my
surprise
she
was
wearing
panties
underneath
her
nightdress
Stop
it!
Don't!
I
can't!
You
already
have
No
I
mean
I
really
can't
I
stared
at
her
I've
got
my
period
she
said
So
what
She
frowned
Don't
you
mind
Not
if
you
don't
To
prove
it
I
gave
her
head
The
effect
was
electric
Overwhelmed
by
this
proof
of
my
devotion
Karen
abandoned
herself
as
never
before
The
fact
that
we
were
making
love
in
the
Parsons
matrimonial
bed
the
sheets
still
warm
and
smelly
from
their
previous
occupant
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
as
well
Unavoidably
detained
in
a
traffic
snarl-up
in
Park
End
Street
Dennis
couldn't
be
with
us
in
person
but
he
was
present
in
spirit
and
the
result
was
quite
literally
indescribable
That
morning
set
the
pattern
for
our
love-making
Outwardly
my
habits
hardly
changed
at
all
I
still
left
Winston
Street
every
morning
for
the
long
cycle
ride
through
town
and
up
the
Banbury
Road
At
about
ten
to
nine
I
tethered
the
bike
to
a
lamp-post
and
proceeded
at
a
leisurely
pace
on
foot
to
the
Parsons
I
had
to
wait
at
most
a
couple
of
minutes
before
Dennis
opened
the
back
door
walked
across
to
the
garage
unlocked
it
swung
the
door
up
and
stepped
inside
While
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
gate
I
walked
up
the
drive
opened
the
front
door
with
the
key
Karen
had
given
me
and
ran
upstairs
After
that
it
was
a
race
I
reduced
the
odds
by
wearing
a
pullover
slip-off
shoes
and
no
underwear
but
it
was
still
touch
and
go
The
idea
was
to
be
in
Karen's
bed
in
Karen's
arms
and
ideally
in
Karen
by
the
time
Dennis
paused
to
call
Goodbye
darling
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
Dennis's
unwitting
participation
in
our
mating
was
so
exciting
that
we
soon
overcame
any
lingering
doubts
about
the
risks
involved
So
far
from
abandoning
our
folly
we
started
pushing
it
as
far
as
it
would
go
This
was
made
perfectly
clear
by
our
spontaneous
reaction
one
morning
when
it
seemed
that
the
game
was
finally
up
Dennis
had
shouted
goodbye
and
gone
out
as
usual
closing
the
front
door
loudly
behind
him
In
the
bedroom
upstairs
his
wife
and
I
were
making
love
slowly
But
instead
of
the
genteel
growl
as
the
BMW
drove
off
Dennis's
footsteps
crunched
back
across
the
gravel
to
the
house
and
the
front
door
opened
Kay!
He
started
to
climb
the
stairs
Karen
thrust
her
pelvis
against
me
and
raked
my
buttocks
with
her
fingernails
Did
you
call
Roger
about
Saturday
Forgot
Oh
for
God's
sake
Karen
Have
you
got
any
idea
of
the
number
of
things
I
have
to
keep
track
of
every
day
Calls
to
make
people
to
see
papers
to
consign
All
I
ask
of
you
is
to
make
one
phone
call
to
firm
up
a
social
event
and
you
can't
even
get
that
together!
While
Dennis
maundered
on
Karen
filled
her
mouth
with
my
shoulder
and
neck
then
broke
away
to
shout
her
brief
replies
in
as
normal
a
voice
as
possible
I
was
working
her
hard
by
now
trying
to
make
her
lose
control
With
Dennis
just
a
few
feet
away
on
the
stairs
it
was
the
sexual
equivalent
of
Russian
roulette
Sorry
It's
no
use
being
bloody
sorry
just
get
it
done
Today
all
right
This
morning
Phone
him
at
work
Have
you
got
the
number
Nah!
Well
it's
in
the
book
Acme
Media
Consultants
Just
don't
forget
again
understand
Wanna!
What
There
was
a
pause
Dennis
squeaked
up
another
couple
of
steps
Are
you
all
right
Flubbadub
You
sound
a
bit
funny
Gawn
Karen
squawked
Slate!
This
was
an
appeal
Dennis
couldn't
ignore
After
a
moment
we
heard
his
footsteps
descending
the
stairs
again
Just
don't
forget
to
make
that
call!
he
shouted
from
the
hallway
By
now
Karen's
neck
was
a
tree
trunk
of
muscles
that
branched
out
across
her
face
slitting
her
eyes
tauting
her
lips
draw-stringing
her
throat
As
the
BMW
finally
drove
away
they
all
let
go
at
once
releasing
an
answering
roar
that
seemed
to
come
all
the
way
from
her
sex
and
anus
rippling
up
her
spine
and
out
of
her
gaping
mouth
That
was
the
best
ever
she
gasped
as
we
lay
side
by
side
our
arms
and
hips
touching
lightly
Whatever
would
we
do
without
him
I
had
my
ideas
about
that

Saturday
I
woke
up
I
was
alone
It
was
daylight
and
it
was
raining
The
bed
was
warm
I
only
had
my
shirt
on
It
was
undone
and
rived
up
round
my
armpits
The
door
opened
My
landlady
backed
into
the
room
She
was
carrying
a
tray
with
breakfast
stuff
on
it
I
looked
at
my
watch
It
said
twenty
to
nine
My
landlady
came
and
sat
on
the
bed
I
sat
up
She
put
the
tray
across
my
legs
On
it
there
was
boiled
eggs
and
things
All
I
was
interested
in
was
the
tea
pot
What's
this
in
aid
of
I
said
Would
you
like
me
to
throw
it
at
you
I
didn't
say
anything
She
poured
the
tea
out
I
drank
a
cup
and
poured
myself
a
refill
Well
she
said
aren't
you
going
to
eat
it
I
don't
eat
breakfast
I
said
You're
a
real
little
charmer
aren't
you
she
said
I
picked
up
my
cup
and
she
moved
the
tray
to
the
part
of
the
bed
I
wasn't
in
I
could
tell
from
her
face
she
wanted
more
I
didn't
want
to
give
her
any
but
if
she
insisted
I
thought
I'd
better
For
the
same
reason
I
had
done
last
night
the
sweeter
she
was
the
less
danger
there
was
of
her
phoning
the
Cop
Shop
if
she
ever
saw
a
newspaper
item
she
might
associate
with
me
You
never
could
tell
She
got
into
bed
and
we
got
down
to
it
We
were
going
strong
when
the
bedroom
door
opened
I
rolled
off
her
very
quickly
The
breakfast
things
went
all
over
the
place
I
took
most
of
the
bedclothes
with
me
My
landlady
screamed
and
tried
to
snatch
the
bedclothes
back
but
she
couldn't
quite
manage
it
so
she
carried
on
screaming
Now
I
was
on
my
back
I
could
see
who
had
opened
the
bedroom
door
Two
men
were
standing
there
looking
at
us
One
was
fairly
tall
with
the
sort
of
unhandsome
good
looks
you
get
on
blokes
in
the
after-shave
ads
He
also
dressed
the
part
He
had
on
a
white
shirt
with
a
broad
hairline
red
and
green
check
pattern
to
it
a
red
knitted
tie
a
bottle
green
V-neck
twill
trousers
and
Oxford
boots
Across
his
shoulders
was
draped
a
fur
collared
waterproof
and
on
his
hands
were
those
tiny
stringy
driving
gloves
The
only
items
not
entirely
for
show
were
the
Oxford
boots
He
was
smiling
The
other
man
was
not
so
tall
and
not
nearly
so
good
looking
He
had
on
a
leather
trilby
and
a
single
breasted
leather
coat
with
a
tie
belt
Underneath
the
coat
was
a
mohair
suit
the
same
colour
as
mine
Not
surprising
as
we
both
used
the
same
tailor
Black
hair
curled
from
under
the
trilby
and
hung
over
his
coat
collar
His
hands
were
in
his
coat
pockets
He
was
smiling
The
good
looking
man
in
the
English
clothes
was
called
Peter
the
Dutchman
The
not
so
good
looking
man
was
called
Con
McCarty
It
wasn't
a
big
step
from
there
to
Mack
the
Knife
They
both
worked
for
Gerald
and
Les
Fletcher
Hello
Jack
said
Con
still
smiling
Don't
let
us
interrupt
you
You
just
carry
on
with
what
you
were
doing
said
Peter
He
was
still
smiling
too
My
landlady
had
stopped
screaming
by
now
because
she'd
managed
to
cover
herself
up
I
sat
up
and
looked
at
Peter
and
Con
Don't
tell
me
I
said
Let
me
guess
Con
rubbed
his
nose
with
his
forefinger
Sorry
about
this
he
said
But
there
you
are
Orders
is
orders
as
they
say
And
what
orders
would
they
be
Con
Gerald
called
us
at
half-past
three
this
morning
Just
after
somebody
had
called
him
Somebody
told
him
you'd
been
making
a
nuisance
of
yourself
I
said
nothing
So
Gerald
asked
us
if
we'd
drive
up
and
ask
you
if
you
wouldn't
mind
coming
back
to
London
with
us
said
Peter
He
said
it'd
be
doing
him
a
big
favour
if
you
would
said
Con
I
said
nothing
I
mean
we
appreciate
why
you're
all
steamed
up
said
Con
and
so
do
Gerald
and
Les
they
really
do
But
they
have
to
be
diplomatic
said
Peter
They
have
to
take
the
broader
view
Both
of
them
were
still
smiling
Gerald
and
Les
sent
you
to
fetch
me
back
I
said
They
just
went
on
smiling
One
way
or
the
other
I
said
They
didn't
say
anything
And
you
think
you're
going
to
do
it
I
said
Nothing
but
smiles
I
leapt
out
of
the
bed
and
picked
up
the
shotgun
and
pointed
it
at
them
Right
I
said
Right
So
take
me
back
to
London
Now
Jack
said
Con
you
know
it'd
be
best
if
you
just
got
dressed
and
came
with
us
I
mean
we
don't
want
to
get
all
involved
do
we
said
Peter
I
advanced
on
them
They
stepped
back
a
little
bit
They
were
still
smiling
Put
it
away
Jack
said
Con
You
know
you
won't
use
it
The
gun
he
means
said
Peter
Out
I
said
Out
out
out!
They
bundled
through
the
door
Con
laughed
If
Audrey
could
see
you
now
he
said
Out
I
said
They
started
down
the
stairs
stumbling
against
one
another
in
their
mirth
I
followed
In
the
hall
Peter
stopped
and
said
We'll
have
to
take
you
back
Jack
whether
we
do
it
now
or
later
Con
opened
the
front
door
Come
on
Jack
he
said
Be
reasonable
Out
I
said
They
went
through
the
front
door
still
smiling
I
followed
them
The
street
was
slick
with
greasy
rain
Peter's
red
Jag
was
parked
by
the
kerb
across
the
street
from
the
boarding
house
He
loved
his
shiny
red
motor
He
kept
it
looking
very
nice
Con
and
Peter
went
down
the
steps
and
stood
on
the
path
and
looked
up
at
me
Well
I
suppose
we'll
be
seeing
you
later
said
Con
Out
I
said
We
are
out
said
Peter
I
began
to
go
down
the
steps
Mind
you
don't
catch
cold
said
Con
They
both
laughed
I
hope
she's
got
understanding
neighbours
said
Peter
They
went
down
the
path
and
got
into
the
Jag
See
you
when
you've
got
your
trousers
on
said
Con
I
went
into
the
hall
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
There
was
a
pay
phone
on
the
wall
next
to
the
hall
stand
I
went
over
to
the
phone
and
picked
up
the
receiver
I
dialled
O
After
a
while
the
operator
came
on
I
asked
for
a
London
number
Transfer
charge
I
waited
A
Mr
Carter
is
calling
from
Will
you
pay
for
the
call
Yes
thank
you
said
Gerald's
voice
Go
ahead
please
caller
said
the
operator
Gerald
I
said
Hello
Jack
I've
just
seen
Peter
the
Dutchman
and
Con
McCarty
Oh
yes
How
are
they
Very
well
I
said
Providing
they
keep
out
of
my
way
Now
look
Jack
No
You
look
You
look
I
shouted
Get
off
my
fucking
back
Gerald
or
there'll
be
trouble
I'm
telling
you
You're
telling
me
Jack
That's
right
Oh
I
must
have
got
it
wrong
I
thought
I
was
the
boss
and
that
you
worked
for
me
I
heard
Les's
voice
in
the
background
saying
Let
me
talk
to
the
cunt
There
was
a
rattle
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
Les
came
on
Now
listen
here
cunt
he
said
You
work
for
us
You
do
as
you're
told
That's
what
you're
paid
to
do
Either
you
come
back
today
or
you're
dead
I
mean
that
Oh
yes
I
said
That's
very
interesting
Gerald
came
back
on
the
line
Les
didn't
mean
that
Jack
he
said
He's
very
angry
just
at
the
moment
I
heard
Les's
voice
in
the
background
saying
yes
he
fucking
well
did
mean
it
Then
what
did
he
mean
Look
Jack
why
don't
you
come
home
and
save
everybody
a
lot
of
trouble
I
am
home
And
who's
everybody
You
for
a
start
And
Us
Why
Never
mind
You
know
something
don't
you
No
I
don't
Jack
Just
come
home
with
Con
and
Peter
and
let's
forget
it
eh
I'm
not
coming
back
Gerald
Not
until
I've
found
who
killed
Frank
You
know
we've
asked
Con
and
Peter
to
bring
you
back
even
if
you
don't
particularly
want
to
come
I
did
gather
that
I
said
Have
they
got
shooters
Jack
Because
they'll
bloody
well
need
them
I
said
and
slammed
the
phone
down
I
went
up
the
stairs
My
landlady
was
standing
at
the
top
I
walked
past
her
into
my
room
and
went
over
to
the
window
I
looked
out
Peter
the
Dutchman
was
sitting
on
the
bonnet
of
the
car
smoking
looking
up
at
the
window
He
waved
when
he
saw
me
I
couldn't
see
any
sign
of
Con
He
was
probably
round
the
back
I
turned
away
and
began
to
get
dressed
My
landlady
came
into
the
room
I
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
I
said
tying
my
tie
What
and
get
myself
beaten
up
again
There's
no
chance
of
that
I
said
Not
much
They're
friends
of
mine
That'll
make
me
feel
better
will
it
I
ignored
her
and
packed
my
hold-all
and
picked
up
the
shotgun
I
went
out
of
the
room
She
followed
me
downstairs
and
into
the
kitchen
I
looked
over
the
top
of
the
lace
curtains
that
covered
the
glass
panel
in
the
back
door
I
couldn't
see
anything
of
Con
There
were
just
dustbins
and
damp
grey
grass
and
beyond
the
thin
rain
more
houses
We're
going
into
the
garage
by
the
door
at
the
side
I
said
I'm
going
to
get
in
the
car
and
the
minute
I
start
it
up
I
want
you
to
open
the
garage
door
Sharpish
What
are
you
going
to
do
Sit
in
the
car
and
whistle
Rule
Britannia
I
opened
the
door
and
stepped
outside
My
landlady
folded
her
arms
and
stayed
where
she
was
I
leant
back
and
grabbed
an
arm
and
pulled
her
after
me
Will
you
be
coming
back
she
said
I
pushed
her
into
the
space
between
the
house
and
the
garage
and
opened
the
side
door
Eh
she
said
I
pushed
her
inside
I
put
the
shotgun
and
the
hold-all
in
the
boot
and
got
in
the
car
and
softly
closed
the
door
I
looked
at
my
landlady
She
was
still
standing
by
the
door
She'd
folded
her
arms
again
I
got
out
of
the
car
and
walked
round
to
her
You're
not
are
you
she
said
I
gave
her
a
clout
and
shoved
her
over
to
the
big
door
and
went
and
got
back
in
the
car
I
looked
at
her
and
she
looked
at
me
I
switched
the
engine
on
She
didn't
do
anything
I
waved
my
arms
about
at
her
She
pulled
a
face
at
me
I
started
to
get
out
of
the
car
She
bent
down
and
put
her
hand
on
the
handle
in
the
middle
of
the
big
door
I
sat
back
and
nodded
to
her
She
turned
the
handle
I
pressed
the
starter
and
the
engine
caught
first
time
She
pushed
against
the
garage
door
and
it
slid
upwards
I
put
my
foot
down
and
the
car
began
to
move
forward

The
smell
of
sweat
was
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
as
I
walked
into
the
club
Not
stale
sweat
but
the
honest
smell
of
hard-working
bodies
Various
voices
greeted
me
as
I
walked
over
to
the
ringside
where
two
teenage
girls
were
engaged
in
kicking
shit
out
of
each
other
in
as
technically
perfect
a
way
as
possible
For
once
I
hadn't
come
to
fight
myself
though
just
watching
made
my
body
yearn
for
release
The
man
I'd
come
to
see
was
standing
in
a
line-backer's
crouch
his
face
distorted
by
yells
of
encouragement
Go
for
it
Christine
he
was
screaming
And
we
think
we've
come
a
long
way
from
the
primeval
ooze
I
thought
as
I
tapped
my
friend
Dennis
the
burglar
on
the
shoulder
He
whipped
round
and
I
took
a
nervous
step
backwards
When
he
saw
me
he
straightened
up
and
grinned
Hiya
Kate
Just
give
me
a
minute
Our
Christine'll
be
through
to
the
semi-finals
in
a
couple
of
minutes
Then
he
spun
back
to
face
the
ring
and
resumed
his
passionate
cheerleading
Nothing
comes
before
Dennis's
family
The
bell
sounded
for
the
end
of
the
round
and
after
a
moment's
conferring
with
the
judges
the
referee
held
Christine's
gloved
hand
up
in
victory
Let's
face
it
with
Dennis's
reputation
there
wasn't
a
judge
in
the
place
who
wouldn't
have
given
any
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
Christine
Not
that
she
ever
needed
that
I
had
to
admit
Christine
emerged
from
the
ring
to
a
bear
hug
from
her
father
Even
her
body
protector
wasn't
enough
to
stop
her
wincing
at
the
force
of
his
embrace
She
gave
me
a
wry
grin
and
said
I'll
soon
be
good
enough
to
lick
you
Kate
On
that
showing
you
could
do
it
now
I
told
her
I
wasn't
joking
either
I
turned
to
Dennis
She's
really
got
it
You're
not
wrong
She
could
go
all
the
way
that
kid
She's
well
sound
Now
what
can
I
do
for
you
Kate
I
need
your
brains
and
your
body
Dennis
He
faked
a
wicked
leer
I
always
said
you'd
never
be
able
to
resist
my
animal
magnetism
Did
you
finally
ditch
the
wimp
then
I
didn't
take
offence
He
affectionately
calls
Richard
the
wimp
to
his
face
Richard
returns
the
compliment
by
calling
Dennis
Neanderthal
Man
and
Dennis
pretends
not
to
understand
what
it
means
They're
all
big
kids
men
And
just
like
kids
they're
ruled
by
their
appetites
Like
Jett
with
Tamar
Sorry
to
disappoint
you
Dennis
but
it's
just
your
muscle
I'm
after
He
pretended
to
be
devastated
by
the
news
clapping
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
saying
How
can
I
face
tomorrow
Kate
Then
he
became
serious
Is
this
going
to
take
a
while
Couple
of
hours
at
the
most
Let
me
take
Christine
home
and
I'll
meet
you
in
half
an
hour
at
your
place
OK
Dennis
was
true
to
his
word
Exactly
half
an
hour
later
my
doorbell
rang
I
had
the
kettle
boiled
in
readiness
He
likes
to
stay
in
shape
does
Dennis
He
seldom
drinks
alcohol
never
touches
drugs
and
runs
six
miles
every
morning
rain
or
shine
His
only
vice
apart
from
burglary
and
GBH
is
cigarettes
I
greeted
him
with
a
cup
of
sweet
milky
coffee
placed
an
ashtray
by
his
feet
and
settled
down
with
my
vodka
and
grapefruit
Schneids
I
announced
I
told
you
all
I
could
about
the
Smarts
he
said
wagging
a
finger
at
me
He
was
right
He'd
given
me
a
head
start
in
my
inquiries
He's
a
great
source
is
Dennis
as
long
as
the
people
I'm
after
have
no
connection
to
his
friends
or
family
Well
those
of
his
extended
family
that
he's
on
speaking
terms
with
at
any
given
time
And
sometimes
he
spontaneously
brings
me
little
gems
if
he
owes
someone
a
bad
turn
His
moral
code
is
stricter
than
that
of
a
Jesuit
priest
and
not
a
lot
easier
to
figure
out
It's
not
the
Smarts
I'm
interested
in
right
now
I
don't
think
It's
a
guy
in
Bradford
called
Fat
Freddy
Mean
anything
to
you
Dennis
frowned
I
think
I've
heard
the
name
but
I
can't
put
a
face
to
it
He's
not
connected
locally
He's
in
the
schneid
merchandising
area
t-shirts
pirate
cassettes
Anyway
there's
a
tie-in
to
another
case
I'm
working
What
I'm
trying
to
get
at
is
why
someone
who's
legitimately
involved
in
the
merchandising
business
would
have
anything
to
do
with
a
schneid
merchant
Dennis
lit
a
cigarette
and
flicked
a
trace
of
ash
off
his
shell
suit
bottoms
S'easy
Kate
Say
I'm
licensed
to
produce
the
straight
gear
for
a
top
band
like
Dead
Babies
and
I'm
a
bit
bent
myself
I
find
out
who's
doing
the
schneids
and
I
offer
them
a
deal
I
won't
shop
them
if
they
cut
me
in
on
their
scam
I
mean
a
couple
of
years
ago
shopping
someone
was
no
big
deal
They
just
got
raided
and
their
gear
confiscated
But
now
they've
changed
the
law
you
can
go
down
for
these
trademark
jobs
So
it's
a
real
threat
Also
if
I
was
double
bent
I'd
offer
my
schneid
merchant
advance
copies
of
the
designs
I
was
going
to
put
out
next
so
he'd
have
a
head
start
against
the
competition
He
sat
back
and
blew
smoke
rings
well
pleased
with
himself
It
made
a
lot
of
sense
I
like
it
Thanks
Dennis
That
was
the
brain
bit
Now
the
muscle
bit
You
know
a
dealer
called
Paki
Paulie
Dennis
scowled
He
hates
dealers
more
than
he
hates
bent
coppers
I
think
it's
something
to
do
with
having
two
young
kids
He
once
broke
the
legs
of
a
pusher
who
was
hanging
round
the
local
school
gates
after
the
local
police
had
failed
to
arrest
the
guy
There
were
a
dozen
mums
who
saw
Dennis
go
berserk
with
a
baseball
bat
but
not
one
of
them
ID'd
Dennis
when
the
cops
arrived
They're
used
to
rough
justice
round
there
Yeah
he
growled
I
know
that
scumbag
I
need
to
know
if
he
sold
any
heroin
to
one
of
the
people
involved
in
this
case
I'm
on
I've
got
a
funny
feeling
he's
not
going
to
roll
over
for
me
That's
why
I
need
a
bit
of
muscle
You
game
When
do
we
start
Dennis
asked
He
drained
his
coffee
mug
and
leaned
forward
expectantly
We
found
Paki
Paulie
an
hour
later
in
a
seedy
bar
in
Cheetham
Hill
The
front
bar
looked
like
any
other
run
down
pub
its
clientele
mainly
middle-aged
poor
and
defeated
But
the
back
bar
was
like
walking
into
another
world
In
the
dim
light
a
handful
of
guys
in
expensive
suits
held
court
at
the
tables
lining
the
walls
accompanied
by
their
muscle
Scruffy
kids
meandered
in
and
out
pausing
by
one
table
or
another
for
muttered
conversation
Sometimes
cash
was
passed
over
fairly
discreetly
in
exchange
for
dope
More
often
the
dealer
got
up
and
accompanied
his
punter
out
of
the
bar's
back
door
into
the
car
park
On
my
own
I'd
have
been
scared
I'd
be
taken
for
a
cop
But
with
Dennis
by
my
side
there
was
no
danger
of
that
He
nodded
towards
one
of
the
corner
tables
while
we
waited
for
our
drinks
That
him
I
asked
trying
to
keep
my
glance
casual
Dennis
nodded
Paki
Paulie
wore
a
shimmering
silver
grey
double-breasted
suit
over
an
open-necked
cobalt
blue
shirt
The
clothes
were
obviously
expensive
but
he
looked
cheap
as
a
bag
of
sherbet
lemons
He
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
gazing
at
a
point
on
the
ceiling
as
if
his
only
worry
in
the
world
was
what
to
drink
next
Next
to
him
a
hard-looking
white
youth
stared
gloomily
into
an
almost-empty
pint
pot
Dennis
picked
up
his
glass
and
strolled
over
to
the
table
with
me
in
his
wake
All
right
Paulie
he
said
Dennis
Paulie
acknowledged
with
a
regal
nod
How's
business
Not
good
It's
the
interest
rates
you
know
Paulie
replied
twitching
his
mouth
into
a
smile
That
was
all
I
needed
A
smack
dealer
with
a
smart
mouth
A
word
Paulie
Dennis
said
softly
Dennis
you
can
have
as
many
words
as
you
want
Paulie's
urbanity
was
firing
on
all
four
cylinders
now
but
it
wasn't
polished
enough
to
cover
the
quick
flicker
of
concern
in
his
eyes
You
heard
about
Jack
the
Smack
Dennis
asked
innocently
Paulie's
eyebrows
rose
He
clearly
knew
all
about
Dennis's
little
vigilante
action
Bad
time
for
accidents
in
your
line
of
business
Dennis
went
on
conversationally
State
of
the
health
service
these
days
nobody
in
their
right
mind'd
want
to
end
up
in
hospital
Paulie's
protection
seemed
to
gather
himself
together
and
shifted
forward
in
his
seat
You
want
to
was
all
he
got
out
before
Paulie
snapped
Shut
it
He
turned
back
to
Dennis
and
said
I
hear
what
you're
saying
Dennis
Dennis
gestured
towards
me
with
his
glass
This
is
a
friend
of
mine
She's
looking
for
some
information
She's
not
the
law
and
if
you're
straight
with
her
there's
no
comeback
Paulie
looked
directly
at
me
How
do
I
know
I
can
trust
you
The
company
I
keep
I
answered
Dennis
put
his
glass
down
and
cracked
his
knuckles
dramatically
Paulie's
eyes
flicked
from
me
to
Dennis
and
back
again
I
took
a
photograph
of
Tamar
out
of
my
bag
It
was
one
I'd
clipped
from
the
papers
that
morning
with
Jett
cut
out
of
it
Has
this
woman
ever
bought
anything
from
you
He
barely
glanced
at
it
and
shrugged
Maybe
How
do
I
know
I
serve
a
lot
of
punters
I
can't
believe
you've
got
a
lot
of
punters
like
this
Paulie
Natural
blonde
doesn't
dress
out
of
a
catalogue
accent
like
Princess
Di
Come
on
you
can
do
better
than
that
Paulie
picked
up
the
picture
and
studied
it
I
seen
her
down
the
Hassy
he
finally
conceded
How
much
did
you
sell
her
then
Dennis
butted
in
thrusting
his
face
forwards
till
it
was
only
inches
from
the
dealer's
Who
said
I
sold
her
anything
Shit
man
what
is
this
You
joined
the
drugs
squad
Dennis's
head
snapped
back
like
a
cobra
ready
to
strike
Before
he
could
complete
the
manoeuvre
that
would
spread
Paulie's
nose
over
his
face
the
dealer
shouted
Wait!
Dennis
paused
The
sound
level
in
the
room
had
dropped
to
an
ominous
level
A
sheen
of
sweat
had
appeared
above
Paulie's
top
lip
His
hand
fluttered
at
his
bodyguard
who
was
straining
at
an
invisible
leash
It's
OK
he
said
loudly
Gradually
the
noise
picked
up
Paulie
wiped
his
face
with
a
paisley
silk
handkerchief
OK
he
sighed
About
a
month
ago
this
tart
came
up
to
me
in
the
Hassy
saying
she
wanted
some
smack
She
didn't
seem
to
know
what
she
wanted
or
how
much
She
told
me
she
wanted
it
for
a
coming
home
present
for
a
friend
enough
for
a
dozen
hits
I
thought
she
was
full
of
shit
but
what
the
hell
I
don't
give
a
monkey's
what
they
do
with
it
So
I
sold
her
ten
grammes
I
never
saw
her
again
And
that's
the
truth
I
believed
him
It
wasn't
so
much
the
threat
of
Dennis
breaking
his
nose
that
had
changed
his
mind
It
was
the
thought
of
what
would
happen
to
him
if
the
O'Brien
brothers
came
looking
for
him
Even
bodyguards
have
to
sleep
The
thing
that
bothered
me
was
that
Dennis's
methods
hadn't
bothered
me
Maybe
I'd
been
reading
the
wrong
books
Perhaps
tonight
I
should
tuck
myself
up
with
an
Agatha
Christie
and
a
few
balls
of
pink
wool

first
for
helicopters
I
want
the
car
found
They'll
need
to
start
around
the
Via
Senese
at
this
end
and
work
south
no
there's
no
point
in
road
blocks
by
this
time
it's
too
late
sometime
yesterday
morning
I've
nothing
more
definite
I'll
need
dog-handlers
immediately
and
they'll
have
to
be
sent
out
to
Pontino
there's
no
need
for
them
to
check
in
here
first
the
girl
they
released
is
in
shock
I'll
have
her
brought
down
here
to
Florence
as
soon
as
she
can
be
moved
but
we'll
have
to
leave
her
where
she
is
for
the
moment
in
fact
put
me
through
to
Pontino
again
now
will
you
They
might
have
something
more
for
me
by
now
There
was
a
clean
notepad
lying
on
the
desk
before
Captain
Maestrangelo
and
he
held
a
pen
in
his
hand
but
he
made
no
notes
There
was
no
need
to
The
routine
at
this
stage
never
varied
It
was
unlikely
that
he
would
find
it
necessary
to
leave
his
office
until
the
time
came
to
visit
the
missing
girl's
parents
and
in
the
meantime
he
was
capable
of
giving
the
usual
orders
while
half
asleep
which
he
very
nearly
was
having
been
called
from
his
bed
not
much
after
five
in
the
morning
It
was
now
five
twenty-five
and
he
rubbed
a
hand
over
his
unshaven
face
as
he
hung
up
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
for
a
moment
until
the
call
from
Pontino
should
come
through
The
lights
were
on
in
the
office
from
which
he
commanded
the
Carabinieri
Company
covering
the
section
of
the
city
that
lay
south
of
the
river
Arno
and
a
large
tract
of
country
going
south
through
the
Chianti
hills
to
the
borders
of
the
Province
of
Siena
It
was
just
his
bad
luck
that
the
village
of
Pontino
lay
just
within
that
border
and
that
it
was
he
and
not
some
Sienese
colleague
who
had
been
awakened
at
dawn
The
city
outside
his
window
was
still
invisible
except
for
a
barely
discernible
outline
of
the
roofs
of
Borgo
Ognissanti
against
the
paler
darkness
of
the
sky
It
was
still
raining
but
less
heavily
The
occasional
small
truck
rumbled
along
the
riverside
going
towards
the
central
market
In
half
an
hour
a
dozen
or
so
cars
would
drive
into
the
inner
courtyard
and
the
morning
shift
would
take
over
The
routine
never
varied
road
blocks
if
the
kidnapping
was
reported
immediately
helicopters
dogs
inform
the
Substitute
Prosecutor
set
up
the
search
for
the
base-man
the
wait
for
the
first
communication
The
parents
were
the
only
variable
and
even
they
didn't
vary
much
their
reactions
followed
a
predictable
pattern
as
well
understood
by
the
police
as
it
was
by
the
kidnappers
The
Captain's
call
from
Pontino
came
through
The
Carabinieri
Brigadier
out
in
Pontino
was
now
ready
with
a
completed
preliminary
report
which
he
read
slowly
word
for
word
as
he
had
written
it
meticulous
and
too
long
The
Captain
didn't
interrupt
him
No
Substitute
Prosecutor
would
appreciate
being
called
at
this
hour
The
girl
then
said
in
very
approximate
Italian
They've
still
got
Deborah
I
have
to
call
the
American
Consulate
She
later
became
much
less
coherent
I
then
telephoned
the
local
doctor
and
Headquarters
The
only
thing
bothering
the
Captain
at
this
stage
was
the
sort
of
Substitute
Prosecutor
he
would
get
These
cases
were
lengthy
and
delicate
It
wasn't
just
that
the
parents
had
to
be
kept
under
control
despite
the
fact
that
they
and
the
police
were
in
many
respects
working
at
cross
purposes
it
was
the
danger
of
some
third
party
interfering
a
go-between
with
power
and
influence
was
what
the
Captain
dreaded
most
A
woollen
sweater
blue
with
red
and
darker
blue
pattern
across
the
shoulders
One
pair
of
blue
jeans
faded
American
label
in
the
pockets
of
which
were
found
two
cinema
tickets
one
wallet
brown
leather
with
a
red
painted
design
containing
An
experienced
Substitute
Prosecutor
who
would
stand
by
him
if
things
got
tricky
and
he
hadn't
always
been
lucky
Throat
lozenges
labelled
Winky
made
in
Milan
the
paper
torn
and
three
of
the
lozenges
remaining
A
folded
letter
hand-written
in
English
on
lined
exercise
paper
and
addressed
to
the
American
Consul
General
of
Florence
no
envelope
What!
There
was
no
envelope
The
letter
Brigadier
the
letter!
The
contents
I'm
afraid
there's
nobody
here
who
can
I'm
coming
out
there
immediately
Well
whoever
the
Substitute
turned
out
to
be
he
was
going
to
be
got
out
of
bed
at
quarter
to
six
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
It
wasn't
the
best
foot
to
start
off
on
but
there
it
was
The
Substitute
was
a
new
man
Milanese
judging
by
the
rapidity
of
his
speech
and
the
way
he
mumbled
his
S's
and
far
from
being
annoyed
he
seemed
to
be
amused
I
was
just
asking
myself
whether
it
was
worthwhile
going
to
bed
or
not
I'll
take
a
shower
and
be
with
you
in
twenty
minutes
I
trust
you've
had
plenty
of
experience
in
this
sort
of
thing
Yes
Good
I
haven't
I'll
take
that
shower
And
he
rang
off
Nonplussed
the
Captain
ordered
a
car
and
after
a
moment's
thought
told
his
sleepy
adjutant
that
he
was
going
back
to
his
quarters
to
shave
and
have
a
coffee
Asking
himself
whether
there
was
any
point
in
going
to
bed
What
sort
of
man
this
letter
business
didn't
ring
true
at
all
that
they
had
taken
the
two
girls
and
released
one
could
simply
mean
a
problem
of
identification
although
even
that
was
unlikely
but
to
send
a
first
message
before
the
parents
had
time
to
become
frantic
possibly
before
they
even
knew
the
whole
thing
could
be
a
hoax
and
yet
the
girl's
condition
a
hoax
gone
wrong!
Impossible
to
judge
anyway
without
reading
the
thing
when
they
got
out
there
whether
it
was
worthwhile
going
to
bed
at
five-forty-five
in
the
morning
What
sort
of
Substitute
Prosecutor
was
this
going
to
be
One
who
smoked
too
much
that
was
evident
by
the
time
the
car
turned
on
to
the
autostrada
going
south
towards
Siena
its
light
and
siren
going
although
the
roads
were
fairly
quiet
It
was
still
dark
and
the
weather
was
wet
and
foggy
but
the
blue
fog
inside
the
car
was
worse
as
the
Substitute
lit
his
third
pungent
little
Tuscan
cigar
The
Captain
tried
to
slide
the
back
window
down
as
unobtrusively
as
possible
when
the
young
Sub-lieutenant
sitting
beside
the
driver
began
to
choke
But
the
Substitute
caught
his
movement
and
with
a
quick
sidelong
smile
and
a
rueful
glance
at
the
offending
object
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
and
said
solemnly
It's
my
only
vice
Out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
Captain
took
in
the
man's
elegant
obviously
expensive
clothes
noted
the
perfume
not
quite
smothered
by
cigar
smoke
and
remembered
the
remark
about
whether
it
was
worthwhile
going
to
bed
He
said
nothing
The
car
left
the
autostrada
and
the
bright
new
factories
dotted
about
the
valley
and
took
a
narrow
winding
road
up
into
the
hills
on
the
right
Even
in
the
dreary
beginnings
of
a
rainy
dawn
the
newly
sprouting
vines
dotted
the
hillside
with
a
green
that
was
almost
luminous
but
the
olive
trees
were
the
same
ghostly
grey
as
the
fog
A
few
people
were
already
astir
in
the
first
village
they
passed
through
and
when
they
reached
the
piazza
in
Pontino
higher
up
a
huddled
group
stood
within
the
light
and
warmth
of
the
doorway
of
the
Bar
Italia
waiting
for
the
first
bus
down
to
Florence
The
baker
and
the
newsagent
were
open
and
there
was
a
light
on
in
the
Carabinieri
station
that
stood
between
them
An
anxious
young
face
disappeared
from
the
window
as
their
car
drew
up
and
parked
under
the
dripping
trees
but
it
was
the
Brigadier
himself
who
appeared
at
the
door
to
meet
them
He
looked
harassed
and
he
was
He
hadn't
expected
this
precipitate
visit
and
in
the
last
hour
he
had
bawled
out
everyone
in
sight
Whoever
had
washed
up
last
night
hadn't
cleaned
the
cooker
there
was
no
light-bulb
in
the
one
cell
in
the
basement
and
someone
had
had
to
be
dispatched
to
wake
up
the
ironmonger
because
nobody
could
find
a
spare
The
coffee
made
by
that
blasted
mother's
boy
Sartini
had
been
like
water
as
usual
and
the
Brigadier
himself
hadn't
had
time
to
go
home
and
shave
One
of
his
men
had
been
foolish
enough
to
point
out
that
the
Company
Captain
was
unlikely
to
want
to
use
the
cooker
and
that
there
hadn't
been
anybody
in
that
cell
in
all
the
eight
years
he'd
been
there
The
Brigadier
had
still
been
bawling
him
out
when
Sartini
had
spotted
the
car
Captain
The
Brigadier
saluted
the
Substitute
and
Captain
and
the
young
lieutenant
and
stepped
back
to
let
them
in
The
driver
waited
in
the
car
I'm
afraid
everything's
not
as
I
would
like
it
to
be
here
you
know
of
course
that
we've
been
without
a
Marshal
for
two
months
now
not
that
I
can't
cope
after
twenty
years
service
in
this
village
but
even
so
Twenty
years
then
you
know
this
area
inside
out
Every
blade
of
grass
That's
not
what
I
Good
The
girl
Is
she
conscious
The
Captain
sat
down
in
the
Brigadier's
chair
where
the
girl's
effects
were
neatly
folded
and
labelled
He
immediately
took
up
and
unfolded
the
piece
of
lined
paper
The
Substitute
had
refused
the
chair
offered
to
him
choosing
instead
to
wander
about
the
room
taking
brief
puffs
on
his
cigar
and
regarding
everything
and
everyone
with
an
amused
detachment
that
gave
the
impression
of
his
being
mildly
surprised
but
pleased
at
having
to
perform
the
office
of
Public
Prosecutor
He
settled
by
the
window
and
stared
across
at
the
red
brick
Communist
club
beyond
the
budding
trees
She's
in
the
cottage
hospital
still
unconscious
as
far
as
I
know
I've
left
one
of
my
boys
there
in
case
she
comes
to
but
she's
running
a
high
temperature
and
they're
afraid
of
bronchial
pneumonia
We've
no
way
of
knowing
how
long
she
was
out
in
that
rain
She's
wounded
too
in
one
leg
but
she
can't
be
moved
down
to
Florence
until
twenty-four
hours
have
passed
because
she
cracked
her
head
when
she
fell
and
there
could
be
concussion
Lieutenant
The
Captain
passed
the
note
up
to
the
young
officer
standing
stiffly
just
inside
the
door
The
Captain's
own
English
was
passable
but
the
younger
man's
was
fluent
He
read
the
letter
aloud
Dear
Daddy
They've
kidnapped
me
Please
help
me
They
will
send
a
message
to
the
Consulate
You
have
to
help
me
Daddy
I
need
you
Debbie
The
Captain
stared
before
him
in
silence
for
some
time
That's
all
there
is
sir
The
young
Lieutenant
handed
back
the
letter
The
Captain
took
it
and
looked
at
it
still
without
speaking
Finally
he
said
Thank
you
Go
over
to
the
hospital
and
relieve
the
local
man
Sit
by
this
other
girl's
bed
Her
name
he
picked
up
the
Brigadier's
report
from
beside
the
telephone
is
Katrine
Katrine
If
she
comes
round
talk
to
her
Write
down
anything
that
she
says
even
in
her
sleep
or
in
fever
You'll
have
to
stay
even
through
the
night
if
necessary
We
don't
know
what
nationality
she
is
but
since
her
Italian
is
poor
it's
likely
that
she
spoke
English
with
her
American
friend
Get
over
there
immediately
Can
you
spare
a
man
Brigadier
to
show
him
the
way
Yessir
Sartini!
The
Brigadier
went
off
in
search
of
that
blasted
mother's
boy
pleased
with
the
thought
of
being
rid
of
him
even
for
twenty
minutes
The
Substitute
had
turned
from
the
window
and
was
watching
the
Captain
curiously
A
typewriter
was
clacking
disjointedly
in
the
next
room
Something
odd
It
seems
so
But
then
it's
too
early
to
judge
We'll
go
on
with
routine
procedure
for
now
Which
is
Dog-handlers
will
be
here
shortly
With
the
girl's
clothes
we
should
be
able
to
trace
her
back
at
least
to
the
point
at
which
she
was
dropped
during
the
night
or
I
hope
so
after
all
that
rain
In
the
meantime
the
helicopters
will
patrol
the
surrounding
area
especially
where
there
are
empty
farmhouses
or
huts
Isn't
it
possible
though
that
the
other
girl
could
be
a
hundred
kilometres
from
here
and
that
this
one
was
dumped
here

put
you
off
the
scent
It's
more
than
possible
it's
probable
but
until
we
know
where
else
to
look
we'll
look
here
The
real
search
can't
begin
until
we
find
out
what
sort
of
kidnappers
we're
dealing
with
For
the
moment
for
all
we
know
they
could
be
a
couple
of
amateurs
from
this
village
who've
got
the
girl
hidden
ten
minutes
from
here
So
we
search
here
And
at
least
we'll
find
the
girls
car
because
according
to
what
one
can
make
out
of
her
statement
they
were
removed
from
it
somewhere
on
the
road
between

Chapter
Four
WE
DID
well
enough
said
Master
James
of
Betton
in
the
abbot's
panelled
parlour
an
hour
later
until
we
came
into
the
forest
there
beyond
Eaton
It's
thick
woodland
there
south
of
Leicester
but
well
managed
as
the
roads
go
these
days
And
we
had
five
good
lads
aboard
we
never
thought
to
run
into
any
trouble
we
couldn't
handle
A
couple
of
wretches
on
the
run
skulking
in
the
bushes
on
the
lookout
for
prey
would
never
have
dared
break
cover
and
try
their
luck
with
us
No
these
were
very
different
gentry
Eleven
or
twelve
of
them
with
daggers
and
bludgeons
and
two
wore
swords
They
must
have
been
moving
alongside
us
in
cover
taking
our
measure
and
they
had
two
archers
ahead
one
either
side
the
track
Someone
whistled
them
out
when
we
came
to
the
narrowest
place
bows
strung
and
shafts
fitted
shouting
to
us
to
halt
Roger
from
Ramsey
was
driving
and
a
good
enough
hand
with
horses
and
wagons
but
what
chance
did
he
have
with
the
pair
of
them
drawing
on
him
He
says
he
did
think
of
whipping
up
and
running
them
down
but
it
would
have
been
useless
they
could
shoot
far
faster
than
we
could
drive
at
them
And
then
they
came
at
us
from
both
sides
I
thank
God
said
Abbot
Radulfus
fervently
that
you
live
to
tell
it
And
all
you
say
all
your
fellows
are
well
alive
The
loss
is
reparable
but
your
lives
are
greater
worth
Father
said
Master
James
there's
none
of
us
but
bears
the
marks
of
it
We
did
not
let
them
put
us
down
easily
There's
Martin
here
was
clubbed
senseless
and
slung
into
the
bushes
And
Roger
laid
about
him
with
his
whip
and
left
the
print
of
it
on
two
of
the
rogues
before
they
downed
him
and
used
the
thong
to
bind
him
But
we
were
five
against
double
as
many
and
armed
villains
very
willing
to
kill
They
wanted
the
horses
most
we
saw
but
three
they
already
had
with
them
the
rest
forced
to
go
afoot
and
the
wagon
was
welcome
too
they
had
one
I
think
already
wounded
They
beat
and
drove
us
aside
and
off
with
team
and
wagon
at
high
speed
into
the
forest
by
a
track
that
turned
southwards
All
the
load
clean
gone
And
when
I
ran
after
and
young
Payne
on
my
heels
they
loosed
a
shaft
at
us
that
clipped
my
shoulder
you
see
the
tear
We
had
no
choice
but
to
draw
off
and
go
and
pick
up
Martin
and
Roger
Nicol
gave
as
good
an
account
of
himself
as
any
of
us
elder
though
he
may
be
and
kept
the
key
of
the
coffer
safe
but
they
threw
him
off
the
cart
and
coffer
and
all
are
gone
for
it
was
there
among
the
coppice
wood
What
more
could
we
have
done
We
never
looked
to
encounter
an
armed
company
in
the
forest
and
so
close
to
Leicester
You
did
all
that
could
be
expected
of
any
man
said
the
abbot
firmly
I
am
only
sorry
you
ever
were
put
to
it
and
glad
out
of
all
measure
that
you
came
out
of
it
without
worse
harm
Rest
here
a
day
or
two
and
let
your
hurts
be
tended
before
you
return
to
your
homes
I
marvel
who
these
wretches
could
be
moving
in
such
numbers
and
so
heavily
armed
Of
what
appearance
were
they
beggarly
and
mean
or
savage
with
less
excuse
for
savagery
Father
said
Master
James
earnestly
I
never
before
saw
poor
devils
living
wild
wearing
good
leather
jerkins
and
solid
boots
and
daggers
fit
for
a
baron's
guard
And
they
made
off
southerly
asked
Cadfael
pondering
this
militant
company
so
well
found
in
everything
but
horses
Southwest
amended
the
young
man
Martin
And
in
a
mortal
hurry
by
all
the
signs
In
a
hurry
to
get
out
of
the
earl
of
Leicester's
reach
Cadfael
hazarded
They'd
get
short
shrift
from
him
if
he
once
laid
hands
on
them
I
wonder
if
these
were
not
some
of
the
horde
Geoffrey
de
Mandeville
collected
about
him
looking
for
safer
pastures
to
settle
in
now
the
king
is
master
of
the
Fens
again
They'll
be
scattering
in
all
directions
still
and
hunted
everywhere
In
Leicester's
lands
they
certainly
would
not
want
to
linger
That
raised
a
murmur
of
agreement
from
them
all
No
sane
malefactor
would
want
to
settle
and
conduct
his
predatory
business
in
territory
controlled
by
so
active
and
powerful
a
magnate
as
Robert
Beaumont
earl
of
Leicester
He
was
the
younger
of
the
twin
Beaumont
brothers
sons
of
the
elder
Robert
who
had
been
one
of
the
most
reliable
props
of
old
King
Henry's
firm
rule
and
they
in
their
turn
had
been
as
staunch
in
support
of
King
Stephen
The
father
had
died
in
possession
of
the
earldom
of
Leicester
in
England
Beaumont
Brionne
and
Pontaudemer
in
Normandy
and
the
county
of
Meulan
in
France
and
on
his
death
the
elder
twin
Waleran
inherited
the
Norman
and
French
lands
the
younger
Robert
the
English
title
and
honour
He
is
certainly
not
the
man
to
tolerate
thieves
and
bandits
in
his
lands
said
the
abbot
He
may
yet
take
these
thieves
before
they
can
escape
his
writ
Something
may
yet
be
recovered
More
to
the
purpose
at
this
moment
what
has
become
of
your
companions
Master
James
You
say
all
of
them
are
living
Where
are
they
now
Why
my
lord
when
we
were
left
alone
and
I
think
if
they
had
not
been
in
such
haste
to
move
on
they
would
not
have
left
a
man
of
us
alive
to
tell
the
tale
we
first
tended
the
worst
hurt
and
took
counsel
and
decided
we
must
take
the
news
on
to
Ramsey
and
also
back
here
to
Shrewsbury
And
Nicol
knowing
that
by
then
Sub-Prior
Herluin
would
be
in
Worcester
said
that
he
would
make
his
way
there
and
tell
him
what
had
befallen
us
Roger
was
to
make
his
way
home
to
Ramsey
and
young
Payne
chose
to
go
on
there
with
him
as
he
had
said
he
would
Martin
here
would
have
done
as
much
but
that
I
was
none
too
secure
on
my
feet
and
he
would
not
let
me
undertake
the
journey
home
alone
And
here
at
home
I
mean
to
stay
for
I've
lost
my
taste
for
travelling
after
that
m
l
e
I
can
tell
you
No
blame
to
you
agreed
the
abbot
wryly
So
by
this
time
this
news
of
yours
should
also
have
reached
both
Ramsey
and
Worcester
if
there
have
been
no
further
ambushes
on
the
way
as
God
forbid!
And
Hugh
Beringar
may
already
be
in
Worcester
and
will
know
what
has
happened
If
anything
can
be
done
to
trace
our
cart
and
the
hired
horses
well!
If
not
at
least
the
most
precious
lading
the
lives
of
five
men
come
out
of
it
safely
God
be
thanked!
Thus
far
Cadfael
had
deferred
his
own
news
in
favour
of
the
far
more
urgent
word
brought
back
by
these
battered
survivors
from
the
forests
of
Leicestershire
Now
he
thought
fit
to
put
in
a
word
Father
Abbot
I'm
back
from
Longner
without
much
gained
for
neither
of
the
young
men
who
brought
down
the
timber
has
anything
of
note
to
tell
But
still
I
feel
that
one
more
thing
of
immense
value
must
have
been
taken
away
with
that
wagon
I
see
no
other
way
by
which
Saint
Winifred's
reliquary
can
have
left
the
enclave
The
abbot
gave
him
a
long
penetrating
look
and
concluded
at
length
You
are
in
solemn
earnest
And
indeed
I
see
the
force
of
what
you
say
You
have
spoken
now
with
everyone
who
took
part
in
that
evening's
work
No
Father
there's
yet
one
more
to
be
seen
a
young
man
from
a
neighbouring
hamlet
who
came
down
to
help
the
carters
But
them
I
have
seen
and
they
do
say
that
this
third
man
was
called
back
into
the
church
by
one
of
the
brothers
at
the
end
of
the
evening
for
some
last
purpose
after
which
the
brother
came
out
with
him
to
thank
them
all
and
bid
them
goodnight
They
did
not
see
anything
being
stowed
on
the
wagon
for
Ramsey
But
they
were
busy
and
not
paying
attention
except
to
their
own
work
It's
a
vague
enough
notion
that
something
unauthorized
was
then
loaded
under
cover
of
the
dark
But
I
entertain
it
because
I
see
no
other
And
you
will
pursue
it
said
the
abbot
I
will
go
again
and
find
this
young
man
Aldhelm
if
you
approve
We
must
said
Radulfus
One
of
the
brothers
you
say
called
back
the
young
man
and
came
out
afterwards
with
him
Could
they
name
him
No
nor
would
they
be
able
to
know
him
again
It
was
dark
he
was
cowled
against
the
rain
And
most
likely
wholly
innocent
But
I'll
go
the
last
step
of
the
way
and
ask
the
last
man
We
must
do
what
can
be
done
said
Radulfus
heavily
to
recover
what
has
been
lost
If
we
fail
we
fail
But
try
we
must
And
to
the
two
returned
travellers
Precisely
where
did
this
ambush
take
place
Close
by
a
village
called
Ullesthorpe
a
few
miles
from
Leicester
said
Master
James
of
Betton
The
two
of
them
were
drooping
by
then
in
reaction
from
their
long
and
laborious
walk
home
and
sleepy
from
the
wine
mulled
for
them
with
their
supper
Radulfus
knew
when
to
close
the
conference
Go
to
your
well-earned
rest
now
and
leave
all
to
God
and
the
saints
who
have
not
turned
away
their
faces
from
us
If
Hugh
and
Prior
Robert
had
not
been
well
mounted
and
the
elderly
but
resolute
former
steward
of
Ramsey
forced
to
go
afoot
they
could
not
have
arrived
at
the
cathedral
priory
of
Worcester
within
a
day
of
each
other
Nicol
since
the
disastrous
encounter
near
Ullesthorpe
had
had
five
days
to
make
his
way
lamely
across
country
to
reach
Sub-Prior
Herluin
and
make
his
report
He
was
a
stout-hearted
even
an
obstinate
man
not
to
be
deterred
by
a
few
bruises
and
not
to
surrender
his
charge
without
a
struggle
If
pursuit
was
possible
Nicol
intended
to
demand
it
of
whatever
authority
held
the
writ
in
these
parts
Hugh
and
Prior
Robert
had
arrived
at
the
priory
late
in
the
evening
paid
their
respects
to
the
prior
attended
Vespers
to
do
reverence
to
the
saints
of
the
foundation
Saints
Oswald
and
Wulstan
and
taken
Herluin
and
his
attendants
into
their
confidence
about
the
loss
or
at
the
very
least
the
misplacement
of
Saint
Winifred's
reliquary
with
a
sharp
eye
at
least
on
Hugh's
part
for
the
way
the
news
was
received
But
he
could
find
no
fault
with
Herluin's
reaction
which
displayed
natural
dismay
and
concern
but
not
to
excess
Too
much
exclaiming
and
protesting
would
have
aroused
a
degree
of
doubt
as
to
his
sincerity
but
Herluin
clearly
felt
that
here
was
nothing
worse
than
some
confused
stupidity
among
too
many
helpers
in
too
much
panic
and
haste
and
what
was
lost
would
be
found
as
soon
as
everyone
calmed
down
and
halted
the
hunt
for
a
while
to
take
thought
It
was
impressive
too
that
he
instantly
stated
his
intention
of
returning
at
once
to
Shrewsbury
to
help
to
clarify
the
confusion
though
he
seemed
to
be
relying
on
his
natural
authority
and
leadership
to
produce
order
out
of
chaos
rather
than
having
anything
practical
in
mind
He
himself
had
nothing
to
contribute
He
had
taken
no
part
in
the
hurried
labours
within
the
church
but
had
held
himself
aloof
with
dignity
in
the
abbot's
lodging
which
was
still
high
and
dry
No
he
knew
nothing
of
who
had
salvaged
Saint
Winifred
His
last
sight
of
her
reliquary
had
been
at
morning
Mass
Tutilo
awed
and
mute
shook
his
head
still
in
its
aureole
of
unshorn
curls
and
opened
his
amber
eyes
wide
at
hearing
the
disturbing
news
Given
leave
to
speak
he
said
he
had
gone
into
the
church
to
help
and
had
simply
obeyed
such
orders
as
were
given
to
him
and
he
knew
nothing
of
where
the
saint's
coffin
might
be
at
this
moment
This
must
not
go
by
default
pronounced
Herluin
at
his
most
majestic
Tomorrow
we
will
ride
back
with
you
to
Shrewsbury
She
cannot
be
far
She
must
be
found
After
Mass
tomorrow
said
Prior
Robert
firmly
reasserting
his
own
leadership
as
representing
Shrewsbury
we
will
set
out
And
so
they
would
have
done
but
for
the
coming
of

still

Not

because
she
could
climax
with
very
little
trouble
if
she
lay
on
top
for
long
enough
and
wriggled
herself
into
position
but
that
didn't
always
seem
to
happen
and
when
it
didn't
if
Kate
couldn't
sleep
she
would
nip
into
the
bathroom
and
quickly
satisfy
herself
But
after
she
and
Toby
had
been
married
for
six
years
something
horrible
happened
and
continued
to
happen
for
some
time
On
a
hot
August
night
Kate
lay
in
bed
reading
a
newspaper
account
of
Marilyn
Monroe's
sad
tawdry
death
Oh
dear
she
was
so
lovable
and
funny
Two
teardrops
of
sympathy
wobbled
on
her
lashes
and
caught
Toby's
attention
She
was
beautiful
too
What
long
eyelashes
you
have
Kate
Yes
Toby
but
colourless
If
I
didn't
wear
mascara
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
see
them
Would
my
eyelashes
be
longer
if
I
put
mascara
on
them
I
expect
so
darling
it
says
here
that
poor
Marilyn's
feet
were
dirty
and
the
scarlet
polish
on
her
toes
was
chipped
Oh
how
sad!
Toby
disappeared
into
the
bathroom
and
emerged
about
ten
minutes
later
Casually
Kate
looked
up
then
did
a
horrified
double
take
Toby
Toby
was
crudely
and
completely
made-up
like
a
raddled
old
dim-eyed
dowager
Kate
said
Oh
do
take
it
off
Toby!
But
Toby
smiled
oddly
looked
at
her
steadily
and
said
in
a
disturbing
high
brittle
voice
a
bit
like
Pagan's
mother
No
I
want
to
make
love
like
this
So
they
did
She
didn't
mention
it
the
next
day
but
that
evening
Toby
having
had
rather
a
lot
of
brandy
after
the
quiche
aux
pinards
said
sarcastically
I
don't
think
spinach
tart
is
one
of
your
stronger
points
darling
and
proceeded
upstairs
When
Kate
went
up
to
bed
with
indefinable
fear
in
her
heart
she
found
him
lying
on
their
Astrid
Sampe
turquoise-striped
bedspread
simpering
at
the
ceiling
His
face
was
fully
made-up
and
he
was
wearing
her
fragile
white
lace
nightgown
She
said
Now
come
off
it
Toby
I've
had
enough
of
this
Please
stop
it
Please
cut
it
out
But
Toby
sat
up
pouted
and
said
in
an
odd
little-girl
voice
Why
can't
Toby
have
nice
things
like
you
do
He
pulled
her
on
to
the
bed
beside
him
and
murmured
Toby
loves
looking
pretty
Toby
loves
dressing
up
like
this
but
promise
it's
a
secret
between
us
between
two
girl
friends
A
very
important
secret
He
didn't
take
long
It
was
all
over
in
ten
minutes
but
it
took
Kate
twenty-four
hours
to
pull
herself
together
again
And
then
it
happened
again
and
Kate
had
another
twenty-four
hours
of
the
shakes
Inexorably
night
after
night
Toby
dressed-up
as
he
put
it
Within
a
fortnight
Kate
was
white
and
taut
from
lack
of
sleep
and
anxiety
but
Toby
was
blooming
On
the
following
Wednesday
he
came
back
from
Harrods
with
a
size
sheer
black
swans-down-trimmed
n
glig
and
matching
d
collet
nightgown
I
told
the
assistant
it
was
for
my
mother
he
said
smoothing
it
over
his
lean
hips
On
Friday
night
he
lashed
himself
into
black
garters
and
fishnet
stockings
and
a
frilly
black
padded
bra
that
he'd
bought
on
Shaftesbury
Avenue
On
Saturday
evening
he
wore
a
red
satin
wasp-waisted
corselet
and
high-heeled
pink
pom-pom
mules
They
didn't
have
my
shoe
size
at
Harrods
so
I
got
these
backless
things
but
they're
still
too
small
Kate
found
the
situation
as
macabre
and
unreal
as
her
father's
funeral
The
rouged
cheeks
ever
so
carefully
shaded
peach
seemed
to
symbolize
death
And
once
again
she
was
bewildered
what
Kate
couldn't
understand
was
the
suddenness
of
Toby's
transformation
He
had
never
given
her
the
slightest
hint
had
always
been
so
severely
practical
He
had
never
so
much
as
worn
a
frilled
shirt
to
a
party
never
indicated
in
any
way
that
he
preferred
his
balls
veiled
by
lace
never
by
word
or
deed
indicated
that
he
was
not
a
normal
heterosexual
Kate
had
never
for
one
moment
suspected
that
what
Toby
really
wanted
in
bed
was
this
gruesome
farce
One
week
she
had
had
a
husband
and
the
next
week
she
had
this
horror
She
could
not
understand
what
was
in
his
mind
could
not
understand
his
odd
trancelike
state
when
he
was
wearing
women's
clothes
What
made
it
even
more
confusing
was
that
Toby
wore
two
sorts
of
female
clothing
he
seemed
to
want
to
pretend
to
be
two
different
types
of
women
so
poor
Kate
never
knew
from
one
night
to
the
next
whether
she
would
find
herself
in
bed
with
a
s
lascivious
black-satin
sophisticated
woman-of-the-world
or
a
demure
white-pantied
schoolgirl
virgin
When
Toby
wore
stockings
and
high
heels
his
muscular
stringy
calves
somehow
stuck
out
sideways
below
the
knees
oddly
bandy
not
like
a
woman's
but
yes
they
were
like
one
woman's
legs
That
night
Kate
had
the
nightmarish
sensation
that
the
person
panting
on
top
of
her
was
her
mother-in-law
Major
Hartley-Harrington's
widow
Toby
refused
to
discuss
the
situation
and
during
the
day
he
seemed
to
be
a
different
person
that
is
to
say
his
normal
self
But
at
night
he
couldn't
wait
to
get
upstairs
sometimes
dragging
Kate
by
the
wrists
in
a
steel
grip
His
eyes
glittered
strangely
in
his
masklike
makeup
Kate
thought
he
looked
like
a
novelette
villain
You've
been
reading
too
much
Barbara
Cartland
she
told
herself
But
there
was
no
other
way
to
describe
that
relentless
breathlessly
excited
glassy-eyed
expression
on
Toby's
face
Kate
didn't
understand
what
was
happening
and
she
didn't
know
what
to
do
What
had
she
done
wrong
Why
had
this
terrible
thing
happened
so
suddenly
Was
Toby
homosexual
If
so
why
did
he
make
love
to
her
Why
should
she
be
so
frightened
of
him
if
he
was
turning
into
a
homosexual
Lots
of
their
friends
were
queer
and
they
didn't
terrify
her
as
Toby
now
did
What
was
terrifying
wasn't
the
makeup
or
the
drag
the
padded
lace
bras
that
monstrous
red
satin
corselet
or
the
way
he
tried
to
strap
his
balls
away
between
his
legs
no
wonder
when
he
wore
high
heels
he
walked
so
oddly
No
what
was
so
chilling
was
Toby's
mincing
simpering
obviously
totally
sincere
mimicry
of
what
he
thought
a
woman
was
deep
down
really
like
It
was
a
travesty
an
insult
to
her
sex
and
that
was
what
Kate
who
had
never
heard
the
word
transvestite
found
so
shocking
She
forced
a
scene
and
Toby
threatened
to
leave
Kate
gave
way
She
forced
another
scene
and
Toby
gently
reminded
her
that
she
was
a
thirty-year-old
barren
bitch
and
would
she
shut
the
fuck
up
Oh
aim
so
sorry
dahling
don't
cray
let's
kiss
and
make
up
hmmmm
Just
a
teensy
little
kiss
he
said
And
he
bent
over
her
and
lifted
her
chin
up
to
his
heavily
lipsticked
mouth
Every
pore
on
his
face
seemed
magnified
as
Mrs
Trelawney's
scalp
had
been
magnified
as
the
black
wiry
hair
had
sprung
from
her
white
scalp
on
that
horrible
bathroom
evening
when
Kate
was
still
a
schoolgirl
Now
she
saw
in
similar
horrid
clarified
detail
the
magenta
grease
that
smeared
the
fleshy
cracks
in
Toby's
mouth
and
clogged
the
shaven
bristles
on
his
upper
lip
He
still
wasn't
very
good
at
putting
on
lipstick
As
her
anguish
and
shame
increased
she
still
hoped
every
evening
that
it
wouldn't
happen
that
night
that
Toby's
fixation
would
disappear
as
swiftly
as
it
had
arrived
Kate
longed
to
confide
in
someone
to
have
Toby's
behaviour
explained
away
to
be
reassured
to
hear
that
everybody
did
it
that
such
things
were
part
of
a
normal
phase
of
a
man's
development
But
she
knew
they
weren't
and
there
was
nobody
to
whom
she
felt
she
could
unburden
her
embarrassing
story
When
she
suggested
talking
to
their
doctor
Toby
went
white
and
glared
at
her
compressed
his
magenta
lips
then
sprang
at
her
and
twisted
her
arm
behind
her
back
until
she
feared
he
was
going
to
dislocate
it
Then
he
violently
shoved
her
down
the
small
flight
of
stairs
that
led
off
their
bedroom
to
the
bathroom
Sprawled
on
the
floor
with
Toby
straddled
over
her
in
his
black
fishnets
hands
on
hips
and
eyes
blazing
Kate
promised
that
she
wouldn't
tell
their
doctor
or
anyone
else
Anyway
who
would
believe
her
she
wondered
hopelessly
as
she
gazed
up
at
lust
in
action
If
you
do
said
Toby
coldly
in
his
normal
masculine
voice
I
shall
simply
deny
it
There's
nothing
to
prove
these
clothes
are
worn
by
me
after
all
they're
in
your
bureau
He
heaved
pleasurably
at
the
black
lace
of
his
corset
He
needs
a
shrink
Kate
thought
but
she
knew
she
would
never
dare
suggest
it
But
she
also
knew
she
couldn't
stand
it
She
had
to
get
away
from
London
away
from
Toby
Increasingly
Kate
felt
depressed
by
Toby's
sexual
behaviour
which
disgusted
and
bewildered
her
She
hadn't
mentioned
it
to
Pagan
at
the
cottage
because
Pagan
obviously
had
too
many
problems
of
her
own
to
cope
with
but
when
Pagan
returned
from
her
honeymoon
with
glowing
descriptions
of
New
York
despite
the
ordeal
of
Christopher's
heart
attack
and
an
invitation
from
Judy
Kate
decided
to
go
and
spend
a
month
there
She
wanted
to
run
away
and
forget
her
misery
for
a
few
weeks
During
the
war
when
Kate
was
seven
she
had
found
an
orange
in
her
Christmas
stocking
when
nobody
in
Britain
had
seen
oranges
for
years
Her
father
had
bought
it
for
a
vast
sum
from
a
sailor
in
a
pub
Kate
could
hardly
remember
what
an
orange
was
like
bananas
and
ice
cream
they
no
longer
existed
But
obviously
Santa
Claus
did
She'd
been
having
doubts
but
the
orange
proved
it
Carefully
she
sniffed
the
fruit
dug
her
nails
in
the
skin
peeled
it
in
one
long
length
then
she
took
a
whole
day
to
eat
it
sucking
each
segment
carefully
savouring
the
fragrant
juice
that
spurted
into
her
mouth
After
that
she
nibbled
all
the
peel
and
made
it
last
for
a
week
To
Kate
New
York
wasn't
the
Big
Apple
it
was
the
Wonderful
Orange
She
knew
London
Paris
and
Cairo
and
had
expected
New
York
to
be
another
similar
big
city
But
New
York
was
like
nothing
she'd
ever
imagined
Out
of
her
bedroom
window
she
blew
kisses
to
the
city
like
a
child
Judy
made
a
great
fuss
over
her
gave
a
party
for
her
spoiled
her
told
everybody
how
wonderful
Kate
was
and
suddenly
she
came
to
life
again
The
glittering
sparkle
and
excitement
of
the
city
simultaneously
soothed
and
exhilarated
her
It
was
like
that
shot
in
the
arm
they'd
given
her
in
the
hospital
it
made
her
feel
that
she
could
do
anything
and
made
her
want
to
do
something
The
night
before
Kate
left
for
London
she
decided
to
tell
Judy
about
Toby's
dressing-up
She
told
Judy
the
whole
story
finally
finishing
by
yelling
at
her
I
can't
stand
it
much
longer
so
what
can
I
do
After
a
moment
of
silence
Kate
started
crying
D'you
still
do
that
Still
cry
all
the
time
asked
Judy
absentmindedly
as
she
thought
hard
It's
a
fu
fu
fu
form
of
self-expression
I
lu
lu
like
crying
It
lets
people
know
how
I
feel
and
it
makes
me
feel
better
Well
kiddo
get
your
crying
finished
and
then
concentrate
Because
I
think
you
should
head
straight
for
a
psychotherapist
when
you
get
back
to
London
You
think
there's
something
wrong
with
me
No
relax!
I
merely
think
that
you
should
discuss
the
situation
with
someone
who
knows
what
he's
talking
about
Because
you
don't
and
I
don't
and
it
doesn't
sound
as
if
Toby
does
So
when
Kate
returned
to
London
she
visited
a
psychiatrist
in
Harley
Street
He
sat
with
his
hands
on
his
chin
in
a
sage
velvet
wing
chair
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
while
she
sat
on
the
other
reporting
to
him
twice
a
week
The
doctor
first
established
that
Kate
had
clearly
told
Toby
she
hated
the
dressing-up
then
suggested
that
she
do
so
again
Once
more
Kate
hit
the
bathroom
floor
The
doctor
wrote
to
Toby
and
asked
to
see
him
about
a
matter
that
is
gravely
disturbing
your
wife
Toby
flew
into
a
rage
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
letter
You've
told
him
our
secret
I
know
you
have
I
thought
we
agreed
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
secret
It's
not
my
secret
it's
your
secret

The
Understudy
I
had
seen
Roderick
Claverham
on
one
or
two
occasions
The
meetings
were
never
planned
They
took
place
on
matin
e
days
I
would
stroll
out
shortly
after
my
mother
had
left
and
he
would
be
waiting
for
me
in
the
street
There
was
always
an
element
of
excitement
because
I
would
be
wondering
whether
he
would
be
there
I
was
almost
sure
that
he
would
be
all
the
same
I
think
we
liked
it
that
way
because
both
of
us
had
a
feeling
that
the
meetings
should
be
something
of
a
secret
in
view
of
the
relationship
between
our
parents
However
I
enjoyed
the
meetings
very
much
We
walked
a
good
deal
we
had
tea
in
our
little
teashop
and
then
he
took
me
to
the
theatre
where
I
would
join
my
mother
and
come
home
in
the
carriage
with
Martha
and
Lisa
We
sometimes
walked
down
Piccadilly
to
Green
Park
There
we
would
sit
and
watch
people
as
they
strolled
by
I
had
learned
a
certain
amount
about
his
home
enough
to
give
me
a
fairly
clear
picture
of
it
I
heard
about
the
interesting
people
who
had
visited
Leverson
Manor
since
the
discovery
of
the
Roman
remains
And
of
course
I
talked
about
myself
I
knew
this
was
an
intermediary
period
We
could
not
go
on
meeting
like
this
In
a
way
it
seemed
almost
furtive
for
I
said
nothing
to
my
mother
of
our
acquaintance
which
was
extremely
odd
for
up
to
this
time
I
had
always
been
completely
open
with
her
And
I
guessed
he
had
said
nothing
to
his
father
I
was
right
when
I
told
myself
that
it
could
not
last
like
that
I
wanted
him
to
come
and
meet
my
mother
he
wanted
me
to
visit
his
home
in
Kent
I
had
a
longing
to
do
so
and
a
burning
curiosity
to
see
Lady
Constance
even
more
than
the
Roman
remains
It
was
Tuesday
and
my
mother
was
spending
the
afternoon
with
her
dressmaker
She
wanted
some
new
clothes
for
the
show
She
thought
it
needed
brightening
up
a
little
I
had
told
Roderick
that
I
should
be
free
on
that
particular
day
and
he
had
immediately
said
we
must
meet
We
made
our
way
to
Green
Park
and
as
we
were
sitting
there
Roderick
suddenly
said
What
are
we
going
to
do
Noelle
Do
I
mean
how
much
longer
are
we
going
on
meeting
like
this
You
haven't
told
your
mother
have
you
I
haven't
mentioned
our
meetings
to
my
father
It
seems
odd
Why
do
we
do
it
I
think
we
both
feel
it
might
be
a
little
embarrassing
for
them
Yes
I
think
it
would
be
for
my
father
I
suppose
my
mother
is
not
so
easily
embarrassed
She
would
think
it
was
quite
normal
I
really
don't
know
what
to
say
about
it
Well
we
have
avoided
mentioning
it
It's
absurd
really
It
is
not
our
affair
It
is
just
that
your
mother
knows
nothing
about
this
friendship
between
your
father
and
my
mother
and
if
she
did
of
course
she
would
not
approve
I
am
sure
she
would
not
and
my
father
would
not
wish
her
to
know
And
because
of
that
you
and
I
are
caught
up
in
this
secrecy
I
should
like
to
call
openly
at
your
house
I
want
you
to
visit
Leverson
After
all
we
are
very
good
friends
At
least
I
hope
we
are
I
hope
so
too
Well
with
two
of
us
hoping
it
must
be
What
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
Noelle
I
really
don't
know
You
see
you
and
I
well
Why
Noelle!
I
was
startled
Lisa
Fennell
was
coming
towards
us
I
felt
myself
flushing
Her
bright
curious
eyes
were
on
Roderick
I
said
Let
me
introduce
you
This
is
Mr
Roderick
Claverham
Mr
Charlie
Claverham's
son
Oh!
How
nice
to
meet
you
And
this
is
Lisa
Fennell
She
is
in
the
show
Countess
Maud
you
know
I
was
taking
the
air
she
said
Trying
to
get
relaxed
for
the
evening's
show
It's
a
lovely
day
isn't
it
I
love
the
parks
in
London
May
I
sit
down
with
you
Please
do
said
Roderick
She
took
her
place
on
the
other
side
of
him
I
don't
think
I've
seen
you
at
the
house
said
Lisa
No
replied
Roderick
I
did
come
once
That
was
a
little
time
ago
I
think
it
was
before
you
joined
us
Lisa
I
said
Has
Noelle
told
you
how
I
came
Yes
She
did
mention
it
Wasn't
it
wonderful
Like
a
fairy
story
I
was
almost
killed
you
know
The
carriage
wasn't
going
very
fast
I
said
And
it
all
started
from
that
D
sir
e
the
famous
actress
has
been
so
good
to
me
Her
voice
shook
a
little
She
is
the
most
wonderful
person
in
the
world
Yes
I
have
heard
that
she
is
very
kind
Do
you
live
in
London
My
home
is
in
the
country
but
we
have
a
small
house
in
London
It's
very
useful
for
my
father
who
needs
to
be
here
quite
often
on
business
It's
very
convenient
I'm
sure
it
must
be
I
love
London
So
ancient
and
modern
at
the
same
time
What
a
combination!
Don't
you
think
that
is
fascinating
Roderick
said
he
did
Mr
Claverham
has
something
very
ancient
in
his
own
home
I
told
Lisa
They
have
found
remains
of
a
Roman
settlement
on
the
land
How
wonderful!
cried
Lisa
She
turned
to
Roderick
Do
tell
me
about
it
I
listened
vaguely
thinking
of
what
Roderick
was
saying
when
she
interrupted
us
It
had
seemed
important
What
a
pity
she
had
had
to
come
along
at
that
moment
She
was
listening
to
him
urging
him
to
tell
her
more
completely
unaware
that
her
intrusion
had
spoilt
our
t
te-
t
te
Roderick
was
too
polite
to
show
the
disappointment
I
felt
sure
he
shared
with
me
Eventually
I
said
Well
I
must
go
back
And
so
must
I
echoed
Lisa
I
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
Let's
go
then
I
said
We
went
back
to
the
house
together
Roderick
said
goodbye
and
left
us
What
a
charming
young
man!
said
Lisa
as
we
went
in
Her
eyes
shone
with
pleasure
Fancy
Charlie's
having
a
son
like
that
and
keeping
him
hidden!
My
mother
returned
soon
afterwards
She
had
had
a
rewarding
session
with
the
dressmaker
and
wanted
to
tell
me
about
it
She
was
changing
the
blue
dress
in
the
first
act
to
one
of
deep
mauve
and
the
one
in
the
last
act
was
to
be
red
Those
colours
stand
out
more
Besides
it
will
give
the
show
a
new
look
And
it
will
be
good
for
us
all
We're
getting
a
bit
rusty
What
do
you
think
I
called
on
Janet
Dare
Poor
dear!
She's
going
out
of
her
wits
She
is
just
longing
to
be
back
If
it
has
anything
to
do
with
her
she
won't
be
off
much
longer
I
thought
I
should
tell
my
mother
that
I
had
met
Roderick
Lisa
might
mention
that
she
had
seen
him
and
it
would
appear
strange
that
I
had
not
talked
of
it
When
we
were
alone
I
said
trying
to
appear
casual
By
the
way
do
you
remember
Roderick
Claverham
Charlie's
son
He
came
here
once
Oh
yes
of
course
What
a
nice
young
man!
I've
seen
him
once
or
twice
I
happened
to
run
into
him
Did
you
How
interesting
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
was
with
him
today
Lisa
was
with
us
Oh
Lisa
I
was
just
thinking
of
her
having
been
with
Janet
Dare
of
course
She
is
so
thrilled
to
have
that
job
in
the
chorus
and
the
understudy
She's
eternally
grateful
to
you
After
all
you
fixed
it
for
her
didn't
you
I
couldn't
have
done
anything
if
she
hadn't
had
the
talent
She
tries
to
be
exactly
like
you
She's
thinking
of
playing
Countess
Maud
that's
why
God
forbid
she
might
have
to
one
day
My
goodness
her
nose
is
going
to
be
put
a
little
out
of
joint
when
Janet
comes
back
The
poor
child
fancies
herself
as
understudy
I
was
thinking
I
need
not
have
any
qualms
about
seeing
Roderick
My
mother
was
not
greatly
interested
nor
was
she
in
the
least
perturbed
about
her
relationship
with
Charlie
A
few
days
later
Jane
came
to
my
room
and
told
me
that
my
mother
wanted
to
see
me
and
would
I
go
to
her
at
once
Is
anything
wrong
Jane
I
asked
She
don't
look
too
well
Miss
Noelle
I
hurried
to
her
room
and
was
immediately
filled
with
alarm
She
looked
most
unlike
her
usual
self
I've
been
so
ill
she
said
It
could
have
been
the
fish
I
had
last
night
But
it
was
immediately
after
lunch
that
it
started
I
feel
dizzy
as
well
as
sick
Why
don't
you
lie
down
I've
been
lying
down
What's
so
awful
is
that
I
don't
think
I
can
go
on
tonight
You
certainly
can't
if
you
are
like
you
are
now
I
think
I
ought
to
call
Dr
Green
Oh
no
That's
not
necessary
It's
just
something
I've
eaten
It
will
pass
in
time
I
think
you'd
better
get
a
message
to
Dolly
though
just
in
case
it's
necessary
which
it
may
not
be
but
we
must
be
prepared
Thomas
can
go
right
away
I
said
In
half
an
hour
Dolly
was
at
the
house
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
What's
happened
Eaten
something
Oh
Almighty
God
what
have
I
done
to
deserve
this
I
should
cut
out
the
dramatics
Dolly
It's
not
the
time
for
them
If
I
can't
go
on
tonight
we've
got
to
do
the
obvious
and
we
ought
to
be
busy
with
it
right
away
just
in
case
it's
necessary
which
it
may
not
be
but
we
have
to
be
ready
Lisa
will
have
to
take
my
place
That
amateur!
She's
not
an
amateur
She's
not
bad
actually
You
yourself
have
said
so
though
it
was
like
getting
blood
out
of
a
stone
to
make
you
admit
it
You
talk
as
though
this
is
of
no
importance
Let
me
tell
you
it's
a
disaster
a
calamity
I've
got
to
placate
all
those
people
who
have
paid
to
see
D
sir
e
not
some
little
amateur
from
the
country
Anyone
would
think
it
was
the
first
time
you'd
had
to
put
in
an
understudy
It's
nothing
Shut
off
the
histrionics
and
bring
out
the
common
sense
You've
got
to
get
busy
Dolly
Of
course
I
might
be
all
right
There
are
a
few
hours
to
go
But
at
the
moment
Is
that
girl
here
asked
Dolly
Yes
I
told
him
Shall
I
tell
her
to
come
down
Right
away
I
went
to
Lisa's
room
She
looked
up
expectantly
My
mother's
not
well
I
said
She's
been
terribly
sick
and
she's
giddy
Dolly's
here
She
thinks
she
might
not
be
able
to
go
on
tonight
She
stared
at
me
She
was
trying
to
hide
the
elation
but
I
could
see
it
there
Naturally
it
would
be
I
understood
Is
she
very
bad
No
It's
only
a
bilious
attack
She's
lying
down
She
feels
dizzy
when
she
stands
up
I
can't
believe
she'll
be
fit
to
go
on
tonight
You're
to
come
down
at
once
Dolly's
pacing
up
and
down
like
an
animal
in
a
cage
and
my
mother
is
trying
to
soothe
him
He'll
be
furious
Well
you
know
Dolly
He
won't
trust
me
to
do
it
He
must
I
answered
her
He
wouldn't
have
given
you
the
job
in
the
first
place
if
he
didn't
believe
you
could
do
it
in
an
emergency
And
your
poor
mother
How
awful!
I
don't
think
it
is
anything
much
She
says
she's
probably
eaten
something
which
did
not
agree
with
her
You'd
better
hurry
The
longer
you
keep
Dolly
waiting
the
more
incensed
he'll
be
She
hurried
down
and
I
went
to
my
room
This
could
be
Lisa's
chance
It
was
only
natural
that
that
thought
should
be
uppermost
in
her
mind
My
mother
was
feeling
a
little
better
but
not
well
enough
to
go
on
that
night
I
wanted
to
stay
with
her
but
she
said
I
ought
to
go
to
the
theatre
to
cheer
Lisa
on
Poor
girl
I
know
what
she
is
going
through
She's
got
strong
nerves
though
I
will
say
that
for
her
And
she'll
need
them
tonight
She's
very
earnest
about
it
all
Quite
right
You
need
earnestness
and
all
you've
got
to
succeed
in
this
profession
I
can
assure
you
She
shouldn't
be
too
confident
though
and
I
don't
think
she
is
She's
got
to
have
that
awful
feeling
that
she's
going
to
lose
her
top
notes
and
fall
flat
on
her
face
instead
of
into
her
bridegroom's
arms
It's
got
to
be
a
mixture
of
fear
and
confidence
and
that's
not
easy
to
come
by
Don't
I
know
it!
But
this
is
a
chance
for
her
If
she
does
well
she'll
be
in
Dolly's
good
books
If
she
fails
it
could
be
the
chorus
for
the
rest
of
her
life
Let's
wish
her
well
She
knows
the
songs
she
knows
the
dances
The
tricky
bit
is
that
twist
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
Once
or
twice
I've
nearly
bungled
it
So
I
went
to
the
theatre
and
I
sat
trembling
for
her
The
curtain
was
about
to
go
up
I
surveyed
the
audience
from
the
box
I
was
sharing
with
Robert
Bouch
re
Just
for
those
few
minutes
we
were
the
only
ones
in
the
audience
who
knew
what
was
to
come
Dolly
lifted
the
curtain
and
stood
before
us
Ladies
and
gentlemen
it
is
with
great
regret
that
I
have
to
tell
you
that
D
sir
e
is
indisposed
and
cannot
be
with
you
tonight
There
was
a
gasp
which
rippled
through
the
stalls
to
the
upper
circle
and
gallery
I
looked
about
me
apprehensively
These
people
had
paid
to
see
D
sir
e
I
have
been
in
D
sir
e's
company
just
before
coming
to
the
theatre
went
on
Dolly
She
is
desolate
because
she
has
to
disappoint
you
She
begged
me
to
ask
you
to
forgive
her
and
she
particularly
asks
you
her
dear
public
to
give
Lisa
Fennell
a
chance
to
show
you
what
she
can
do
D
sir
e
has
absolute
faith
in
Lisa
and
I
am
sure
that
after
tonight's
performance
you
will
share
that
faith
I
know
how
you
all
love
D
sir
e
but
you
would
not
want
her
here
when
she
should
be
in
bed
She
sends
her
love
to
you
all
She
is
missing
you
as
you
are
missing
her
But
she
fervently
hopes
that
you
will
give
Lisa
a
chance
and
that
you
will
not
be
disappointed
The
curtain
was
up
The
opening
chorus
had
begun
and
there
was
Lisa
giving
a
fair
imitation
of
D
sir
e
in
Can
I
help
you
Madam
It
was
a
good
performance
I
followed
her
every
movement
watching
for
pitfalls
like
the
twirl
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
The
audience
applauded
Some
of
them
must
have
realized
what
an
ordeal
the
poor
girl
was
going
through
and
they
had
set
aside
their
disappointment
in
not
seeing
D
sir
e
and
were
giving
encouragement
to
the
beginner
I
said
to
Robert
It's
going
to
be
all
right
isn't
it
She
is
so
like
he
said
She
copy
yes
It
is
like
seeing
a
shadow
of
D
sir
e
you
understand
I
see
what
you
mean
I
replied
But
I
think
the
audience
are
not
displeased
Oh
no
no
But
they
do
not
forget
they
pay
to
see
D
sir
e
It
is
a
pity
for
Lisa
that
it
is
D
sir
e
she
must
follow
If
it
were
some
other
someone
not
so
how
shall
we
say
so
much
herself
so
distinguished
it
would
be
better
She
is
good
this
girl
but
she
is
not
D
sir
e
I
saw
what
he
meant
She
had
modelled
herself
too
closely
on
D
sir
e
submerging
her
own
personality
into
achieving
it
If
she
had
tried
to
present
herself
and
not
a
pale
shadow
of
D
sir
e
she
would
have
made
more
impact
As
it
was
she
was
D
sir
e
without
that
inimitable
charm
that
overpowering
charisma

Mrs

Xanthe
By
virtue
of
having
paid
double
and
possibly
treble
Filmer
had
a
double
bedroom
all
to
himself
Only
the
lower
bunk
had
been
prepared
for
the
night
the
upper
was
still
in
the
ceiling
For
all
that
he
could
be
expected
to
stay
in
the
Lorrimores
car
for
at
least
fifteen
more
minutes
I
felt
decidedly
jittery
and
I
left
the
door
open
so
that
if
he
did
come
back
unexpectedly
I
could
say
I
was
merely
checking
that
everything
was
in
order
My
uniform
had
multiple
advantages
The
bedrooms
were
small
as
one
would
expect
though
in
the
daytime
with
the
beds
folded
away
there
was
comfortable
space
There
was
a
washbasin
in
full
view
with
the
rest
of
the
plumbing
in
a
discreet
little
closet
For
hanging
clothes
there
was
a
slot
behind
the
bedheads
of
about
eight
inches
wide
enough
in
Filmer's
case
for
two
suits
Another
two
jackets
hung
on
hangers
on
pegs
on
the
wall
I
searched
quickly
through
all
the
pockets
but
they
were
mostly
empty
There
was
only
in
one
inner
pocket
a
receipt
for
a
watch
repair
which
I
replaced
where
I
found
it
There
were
no
drawers
more
or
less
everything
else
had
to
be
in
his
suitcase
which
stood
against
the
wall
With
an
eye
on
the
corridor
outside
I
tried
one
of
the
latches
and
wasn't
surprised
to
find
it
locked
That
left
only
a
tiny
cupboard
above
the
hanging
space
in
which
Julius
Apollo
had
stored
a
black
leather
toilet
bag
and
his
brushes
On
the
floor
below
his
suits
pushed
to
the
back
of
the
hanging
space
I
found
his
briefcase
I
put
my
head
out
of
the
door
which
was
directly
beside
the
hanging
space
and
looked
up
and
down
the
corridor
No
one
in
sight
I
went
down
on
hands
and
knees
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
doorway
with
an
excuse
ready
of
looking
for
a
coin
I'd
dropped
I
put
a
hand
into
the
luggage
space
and
drew
the
briefcase
to
the
front
and
it
was
of
black
crocodile
skin
with
gold
clasps
as
I'd
seen
at
Nottingham
races
The
fact
of
its
presence
was
all
I
was
going
to
learn
however
as
it
had
revolving
combination
locks
which
were
easy
enough
to
undo
but
only
if
one
had
two
hours
to
spend
on
each
lock
which
I
hadn't
Whether
or
not
the
briefcase
still
contained
whatever
Horfitz
had
given
Filmer
at
Nottingham
was
anyone's
guess
and
dearly
though
I
would
have
liked
to
look
at
the
contents
I
didn't
want
to
risk
any
more
at
that
point
I
pushed
the
black
case
deep
into
the
hanging
space
again
stood
up
outside
the
door
closed
it
and
went
back
to
the
scenes
of
jollity
to
the
rear
It
was
by
this
time
nearly
midnight
The
Youngs
were
standing
up
in
the
dining
room
ready
to
go
to
bed
Xanthe
however
alarmed
by
the
departure
of
her
new-found
friend
was
practically
clinging
to
Mrs
Young
and
with
an
echo
of
the
earlier
hysteria
was
saying
that
she
couldn't
possibly
sleep
in
the
private
car
she
would
have
nightmares
she
would
be
too
scared
to
stay
she
was
sure
whoever
had
uncoupled
the
car
before
would
do
it
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
they
would
all
be
killed
when
the
Canadian
crashed
into
them
because
the
Canadian
was
still
there
behind
us
wasn't
it
wasn't
it
Yes
it
was
Mrs
Young
did
her
best
to
soothe
her
but
it
was
impossible
not
to
respect
her
fears
She
had
undoubtedly
nearly
been
killed
Mrs
Young
told
her
that
the
madman
who
had
mischievously
unhitched
the
car
was
hours
behind
us
in
Cartier
but
Xanthe
was
beyond
reassurance
Mrs
Young
appealed
to
Nell
asking
if
there
was
anywhere
else
that
Xanthe
could
sleep
and
Nell
consulting
the
ever-present
clipboard
shook
her
head
doubtfully
There's
an
upper
berth
in
A
section
she
said
slowly
but
it
only
has
a
curtain
and
no
facilities
except
at
the
end
of
the
car
and
it's
hardly
what
Xanthe's
used
to
I
don't
care
Xanthe
said
passionately
I'll
sleep
on
the
floor
or
on
the
seats
in
the
lounge
or
anywhere
I'll
sleep
in
that
upper
berth
Please
let
me
I
don't
see
why
not
then
Nell
said
What
about
night
things
I'm
not
going
into
our
car
to
fetch
them
I'm
not
All
right
Nell
said
I'll
go
and
ask
your
mother
Mrs
Young
stayed
with
Xanthe
who
was
again
faintly
trembling
until
at
length
Nell
returned
with
both
a
small
grip
and
Bambi
Bambi
tried
to
get
her
daughter
to
change
her
mind
but
predictably
without
success
I
thought
it
unlikely
that
Xanthe
would
ever
sleep
in
that
car
again
so
strong
was
her
present
reaction
She
Bambi
Nell
and
the
Youngs
made
their
way
past
me
without
looking
at
me
and
continued
on
along
the
corridor
beside
the
kitchen
going
to
inspect
the
revised
quarters
which
I
knew
were
in
the
sleeping
car
forward
of
Filmer's
After
a
while
Bambi
and
Nell
returned
alone
and
Bambi
with
an
unexcited
word
of
gratitude
to
Nell
walked
a
few
paces
forward
and
stopped
beside
her
son
who
had
done
nothing
to
comfort
or
help
his
sister
and
was
now
sitting
alone
Come
along
Sheridan
she
said
her
tone
without
peremptoriness
but
also
without
affection
Your
father
asks
you
to
come
Sheridan
gave
her
a
look
of
hatred
which
seemed
not
in
the
least
to
bother
her
She
stood
patiently
waiting
until
with
exceedingly
bad
grace
he
got
to
his
feet
and
followed
her
homewards
Bambi
it
seemed
to
me
had
taught
herself
not
to
care
for
Sheridan
so
as
not
to
be
hurt
by
him
She
too
like
Mercer
must
have
suffered
for
years
from
his
boorish
behaviour
in
public
and
she
had
distanced
herself
from
it
She
didn't
try
to
buy
the
toleration
of
the
victims
of
his
rudeness
as
Mercer
did
she
ignored
the
rudeness
instead
I
wondered
which
had
come
first
the
chill
and
disenchantment
of
her
worldly
sophistication
or
the
lack
of
warmth
in
her
son
and
perhaps
there
was
ice
in
both
of
them
and
the
one
had
reinforced
the
other
Bambi
I
thought
was
a
highly
inappropriate
name
for
her
she
was
no
innocent
wide-eyed
smooth-skinned
fawn
but
an
experienced
aloof
good-looking
woman
in
the
skin
of
minks
Nell
watching
them
go
sighed
and
said
She
didn't
kiss
Xanthe
goodnight
you
know
or
give
her
even
a
hug
to
comfort
her
Nothing
And
Mercer's
so
nice
Forget
them
Yes
You
do
realize
the
press
will
be
down
on
this
train
like
a
pack
of
hunting
lions
at
the
next
stop
Lionesses
I
said
What
It's
the
females
who
hunt
in
a
pack
One
male
sits
by
watching
and
takes
the
lion's
share
of
the
kill
I
don't
want
to
know
that
Our
next
stop
I
said
will
be
fifteen
minutes
at
White
River
in
the
middle
of
the
night
After
the
delay
we'll
aim
to
arrive
at
four-oh-five
depart
four-twenty
And
after
that
Except
for
a
three-minute
pause
in
a
back-of-beyond
we
stop
at
Thunder
Bay
for
twenty-five
minutes
at
ten-fifty
tomorrow
morning
Do
you
know
the
whole
timetable
by
heart
Emil
told
me
to
learn
it
He
was
right
when
he
said
the
question
I
would
have
to
answer
most
was
When
do
we
reach
so
and
so
and
if
I
were
a
regular
waiter
he
said
I
would
know
the
answers
even
though
we're
thirty-five
minutes
earlier
everywhere
than
the
regular
Canadian
Emil
is
cute
she
said
I
looked
at
her
in
surprise
I
wouldn't
have
thought
of
Emil
as
cute
Small
neat
bright
and
generous
yes
Cute
I
asked
I
would
hope
she
said
that
you
don't
think
so
No
Good
She
was
relieved
I
saw
Weren't
you
sure
I
asked
curiously
Am
I
so
ambivalent
Well
There
was
a
touch
of
embarrassment
I
didn't
mean
to
get
into
this
sort
of
conversation
really
I
didn't
But
if
you
want
to
know
there's
something
about
you
that's
secret
ultra-private
as
if
you
didn't
want
to
be
known
too
well
So
I
just
wondered
I'm
sorry
I
shall
shower
you
with
ravening
kisses
She
laughed
Not
your
style
Wait
and
see
And
two
people
didn't
I
thought
drift
into
talking
like
that
after
knowing
each
other
for
such
a
short
while
unless
there
was
immediate
trust
and
liking
We
were
standing
in
the
tiny
lobby
between
the
kitchen
and
the
dining
room
and
she
still
had
the
clipboard
clasped
to
her
chest
She
would
have
to
put
it
down
I
thought
fleetingly
before
any
serious
ravening
could
take
place
You
always
have
jokes
in
your
eyes
she
said
And
you
never
tell
them
I
was
thinking
about
how
you
use
your
clipboard
as
chain-mail
Her
own
eyes
widened
A
lousy
man
in
the
magazine
office
squeezed
my
breast
Why
am
I
telling
you
It
was
years
ago
Why
should
I
care
Anyway
where
else
would
you
carry
a
clipboard
She
put
it
down
all
the
same
on
the
counter
but
we
didn't
talk
much
longer
as
the
revellers
from
the
rear
began
coming
through
to
go
to
the
bedrooms
I
retreated
into
the
kitchen
and
I
could
hear
people
asking
Nell
what
time
they
could
have
breakfast
Between
seven
and
nine-thirty
she
said
Sleep
well
everybody
She
put
her
head
into
the
kitchen
Same
to
you
sleep
well
I'm
off
to
bed
Goodnight
I
said
smiling
Aren't
you
going
Yes
in
a
while
When
everything's
safe
You
might
say
so
What
exactly
does
the
Jockey
Club
expect
you
to
do
See
trouble
before
it
comes
But
that's
practically
impossible
Mm
I
said
I
didn't
foresee
anyone
uncoupling
the
Lorrimores
You'll
be
fired
for
that
she
said
dryly
so
if
you
sleep
sleep
well
Tor
would
kiss
you
I
said
Tommy
can't
I'll
count
it
done
She
went
away
blithely
the
clipboard
again
in
place
a
habit
I
supposed
as
much
as
a
defence
I
walked
back
to
the
bar
and
wasted
time
with
the
barman
The
intent
poker
school
looked
set
for
an
all-night
session
the
dancing
was
still
causing
laughter
in
the
lounge
and
the
northern
lights
were
entrancing
the
devotees
in
the
dome
The
barman
yawned
and
said
he'd
be
closing
the
bar
soon
Alcohol
stopped
at
midnight

BELFAST
CHAPTER
ONE
THERE
was
an
Angel
of
Death
on
top
of
an
ornate
mausoleum
in
one
corner
arms
extended
I
remember
that
well
because
someone
was
practising
the
organ
and
light
drifted
across
the
churchyard
in
coloured
bands
through
stained-glass
windows
The
church
wasn't
particularly
old
built
on
a
high
tide
of
Victorian
prosperity
like
the
tall
houses
surrounding
it
St
Martin's
Square
A
good
address
once
Now
just
a
shabby
backwater
in
Belsize
Park
but
a
nice
quiet
area
where
a
woman
alone
might
walk
down
to
the
corner
shop
at
midnight
in
safety
and
people
minded
their
own
business
The
flat
at
number
thirteen
was
on
the
ground
floor
My
agent
had
borrowed
it
for
me
from
a
cousin
who
had
gone
to
New
York
for
six
months
It
was
old-fashioned
and
comfortable
and
suited
me
fine
I
was
on
the
downhill
slope
of
a
new
novel
and
needed
to
visit
the
Reading
Room
at
the
British
Museum
most
days
But
that
November
evening
the
evening
it
all
started
it
was
raining
heavily
and
just
after
six
I
passed
through
the
iron
gates
and
followed
the
path
through
the
forest
of
Gothic
monuments
and
gravestones
In
spite
of
my
umbrella
the
shoulders
of
my
trenchcoat
were
soaked
not
that
it
bothered
me
I've
always
liked
the
rain
the
city
at
night
wet
streets
stretching
into
winter
darkness
a
peculiar
feeling
of
freedom
that
it
contains
And
things
had
gone
well
that
day
with
the
work
the
end
was
very
definitely
in
sight
The
Angel
of
Death
was
closer
now
shadowed
in
the
half-light
from
the
church
the
two
marble
attendants
on
guard
at
the
mausoleum's
bronze
doors
everything
as
usual
except
that
tonight
I
could
have
sworn
that
there
was
a
third
figure
and
that
it
moved
out
of
the
darkness
towards
me
For
a
moment
I
knew
genuine
fear
and
then
as
it
came
into
the
light
I
saw
a
young
woman
quite
small
and
wearing
a
black
beret
and
soaked
raincoat
She
had
a
briefcase
in
one
hand
The
face
was
pale
the
eyes
dark
and
somehow
anxious
Mr
Higgins
You
are
Jack
Higgins
aren't
you
She
was
American
that
much
was
obvious
I
took
a
deep
breath
to
steady
my
nerves
That's
right
What
can
I
do
for
you
I
must
talk
to
you
Mr
Higgins
Is
there
somewhere
we
could
go
I
hesitated
reluctant
for
all
sorts
of
obvious
reasons
to
take
this
any
further
and
yet
there
was
something
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
about
her
Something
not
to
be
resisted
I
said
My
flat's
just
over
the
square
there
I
know
she
said
I
still
hesitated
and
she
added
You
won't
regret
it
believe
me
I've
information
of
vital
importance
to
you
About
what
I
asked
What
really
happened
afterwards
at
Studley
Constable
Oh
lots
of
things
you
don't
know
Which
was
enough
I
took
her
arm
and
said
Right
let's
get
in
out
of
this
damn
rain
before
you
catch
your
death
and
you
can
tell
me
what
the
hell
this
is
all
about
The
house
interior
had
changed
very
little
certainly
not
in
my
flat
where
the
tenant
had
stayed
with
a
late
Victorian
decor
lots
of
mahogany
furniture
red
velvet
curtains
at
the
bow
window
and
a
sort
of
Chinese
wallpaper
in
gold
and
green
heavily
patterned
with
birds
Except
for
the
central
heating
radiators
the
only
other
concession
to
modern
living
was
the
kind
of
gas
fire
which
made
it
seem
as
if
logs
burned
brightly
in
a
stainless
steel
basket
That's
nice
she
said
and
turned
to
face
me
even
smaller
than
I
had
thought
She
held
out
her
right
hand
awkwardly
still
clutching
the
briefcase
in
the
other
Cohen
she
said
Ruth
Cohen
I
said
Lets
have
that
coat
I'll
put
it
in
front
of
one
of
the
radiators
Thank
you
She
fumbled
at
her
belt
with
one
hand
and
I
laughed
and
took
the
briefcase
from
her
Here
let
me
As
I
put
it
down
on
the
table
I
saw
that
her
initials
were
etched
on
the
flap
in
black
The
only
difference
was
that
it
said
Ph.D
at
the
end
of
it
Ph.D
I
said
She
smiled
slightly
as
she
got
out
of
the
coat
Harvard
modern
history
That's
interesting
I
said
I'll
make
some
tea
or
would
you
prefer
coffee
She
smiled
again
Six
months
post
doc
at
London
University
Mr
Higgins
I'd
very
definitely
prefer
your
tea
I
went
through
to
the
kitchen
and
put
on
the
kettle
and
made
a
tray
ready
I
lit
a
cigarette
as
I
waited
and
turned
to
find
her
leaning
on
the
doorway
arms
folded
Your
thesis
I
said
For
your
doctorate
What
was
the
subject
Certain
aspects
of
the
Third
Reich
in
the
Second
World
War
Interesting
Cohen
are
you
Jewish
I
turned
to
make
the
tea
My
father
was
a
german
Jew
He
survived
Auschwitz
and
made
it
to
the
US
but
died
the
year
after
I
was
born
I
could
think
of
no
more
than
the
usual
inadequate
response
I'm
sorry
She
stared
at
me
blankly
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
went
back
to
the
sitting
room
I
followed
with
the
tray
placed
it
on
a
small
coffee
table
by
the
fire
and
we
sat
opposite
each
other
in
wingback
chairs
Which
explains
your
interest
in
the
Third
Reich
I
said
as
I
poured
the
tea
She
frowned
and
took
the
cup
of
tea
I
handed
her
I'm
just
an
historian
No
axe
to
grind
My
particular
obsession
is
with
the
Abwehr
German
Military
Intelligence
Why
they
were
so
good
and
why
they
were
so
bad
at
the
same
time
Admiral
Wilhelm
Canaris
and
his
merry
men
I
shrugged
I'd
say
his
heart
was
never
in
it
but
as
the
SS
hanged
him
at
Flossenburg
concentration
camp
in
April
forty-five
we'll
never
know
Which
brings
me
to
you
she
said
And
your
book
The
Eagle
Has
Landed
A
novel
Dr
Cohen
I
said
Pure
speculation
At
least
fifty
per
cent
of
which
is
documented
historical
fact
you
claim
that
yourself
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
She
leaned
forward
hands
clenched
on
her
knees
a
kind
of
fierceness
there
I
said
softly
All
right
so
what
exactly
are
you
getting
at
Remember
how
you
found
out
about
the
affair
in
the
first
place
she
said
The
thing
that
started
you
off
Of
course
I
said
The
monument
to
Steiner
and
his
men
the
villagers
of
Studley
Constable
had
hidden
under
the
tombstone
in
the
churchyard
Remember
what
it
said
Exactly
she
said
Here
lies
Lieutenant
Colonel
Kurt
Steiner
and
thirteen
German
paratroopers
killed
in
action
on
sixth
November
nineteen
forty-three
So
what's
your
point
Thirteen
plus
one
makes
fourteen
only
there
aren't
fourteen
bodies
in
that
grave
There
are
only
thirteen
I
stared
at
her
incredulously
How
in
the
hell
do
you
make
that
out
Because
Kurt
Steiner
didn't
die
that
night
on
the
terrace
at
Meltham
House
Mr
Higgins
She
reached
for
the
briefcase
had
it
open
in
a
second
and
produced
a
brown
manilla
folder
And
I
have
the
proof
right
here
Which
very
definitely
called
for
Bushmills
whiskey
I
poured
one
and
said
All
right
do
I
get
to
see
it
Of
course
that's
why
I'm
here
but
first
let
me
explain
Any
study
of
Abwehr
intelligence
affairs
during
the
Second
World
War
constantly
refers
to
the
work
of
SOE
the
Special
Operations
Executive
set
up
by
British
Intelligence
in
on
Churchill's
instructions
to
coordinate
resistance
and
the
underground
movement
in
Europe
Set
Europe
ablaze
that's
what
the
old
man
ordered
I
said
I
was
fascinated
to
discover
that
a
number
of
Americans
worked
for
SOE
before
America
came
into
the
war
I
thought
there
might
be
a
book
in
it
I
arranged
to
come
over
here
to
do
the
research
and
a
name
that
came
up
again
and
again
was
Munro
Brigadier
Dougal
Munro
Before
the
war
he
was
an
archaeologist
at
Oxford
At
SOE
he
was
head
of
Section
D
What
was
commonly
known
as
the
dirty
tricks
department
I
had
heard
of
him
I
said
I
did
most
of
my
research
at
the
Public
Records
Office
As
you
know
few
files
dealing
with
intelligence
matters
are
immediately
available
Some
are
on
a
twenty-five-year
hold
some
fifty
And
exceptionally
sensitive
material
a
hundred
years
I
said
That's
what
I
have
here
She
held
up
the
folder
A
hundred-year-hold
file
concerning
Dougal
Munro
Kurt
Steiner
Liam
Devlin
and
others
Quite
a
story
believe
me
She
passed
it
across
and
I
held
it
on
my
knees
without
opening
it
How
on
earth
did
you
come
by
this
I
checked
out
some
files
concerning
Munro
yesterday
There
was
a
young
clerk
on
duty
on
his
own
Got
careless
I
guess
I
found
the
file
sandwiched
in
between
two
others
sealed
of
course
You
have
to
do
your
research
on
the
premises
at
the
Records
Office
but
since
it
wasn't
on
the
booking-out
form
I
slipped
it
into
my
briefcase
A
criminal
offence
under
the
Defence
of
the
Realm
Act
I
told
her
I
know
I
opened
the
seals
as
carefully
as
I
could
and
read
the
file
It's
only
a
thirty-page
resume
of
certain
events
certain
astonishing
events
And
then
I
photocopied
it
The
wonders
of
modern
technology
allow
them
to
tell
when
that's
been
done
I
know
Anyway
I
resealed
the
file
and
took
it
back
this
morning
And
how
did
you
manage
to
return
it
I
asked
Checked
out
the
same
file
yesterday
Took
the
Munro
file
back
to
the
desk
and
told
the
duty
clerk
there'd
been
an

Did
he
believe
you
I
suppose
so
I
mean
why
wouldn't
he
The
same
clerk
No
an
older
man
I
sat
there
thinking
about
it
feeling
decidedly
uneasy
Finally
I
said
Why
don't
you
make
us
some
fresh
tea
while
I
have
a
go
at
this
All
right
She
took
the
tray
and
went
out
I
hesitated
then
opened
the
file
and
started
to
read
I
wasn't
even
aware
that
she
was
there
so
gripped
was
I
by
the
events
recorded
in
that
file
When
I
was
finished
I
closed
it
and
looked
up
She
was
back
in
the
other
chair
watching
me
a
curiously
intent
look
on
her
face
I
said
I
can
understand
the
hundred-year
hold
The
powers
that
be
wouldn't
want
this
to
come
out
not
even
now
That's
what
I
thought
Can
I
hang
on
to
it
for
a
while
She
hesitated
then
nodded
Till
tomorrow
if
you
like
I'm
going
back
to
the
States
on
the
evening
flight
Pan
Am
A
sudden
decision
She
went
and
got
her
raincoat
That's
right
I've
decided
I'd
rather
be
back
in
my
own
country
Worried
I
asked
I'm
probably
being
hypersensitive
but
sure
I'll
pick
the
file
up
tomorrow
afternoon
Say
three
o'clock
on
my
way
to
Heathrow
Fine
I
put
the
file
down
on
top
of
my
coffee
table
The
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
chimed
the
half-hour
seven
thirty
as
I
walked
her
to
the
door
I
opened
it
and
we
stood
for
a
moment
rain
driving
down
hard
Of
course
there
is
someone
who
could
confirm
the
truth
of
that
file
she
said
Liam
Devlin
You
said
in
your
book
he
was
still
around
operating
with
the
Provisional
IRA
in
Ireland
Last
I
heard
I
said
Sixty-seven
he'll
be
now
but
lively
with
it
Well
then
She
smiled
again
I'll
see
you
tomorrow
afternoon
She
went
down
the
steps
and
walked
away
through
the
rain
vanishing
in
the
early
evening
mist
at
the
end
of
the
street

That
fourth
day
then
though
indeed
the
fifth
but
to
continue
After
the
captain
had
turned
to
the
stern
rail
I
remained
for
some
time
endeavouring
to
engage
Mr
Cumbershum
in
conversation
He
answered
me
in
the
fewest
possible
words
and
I
began
to
understand
that
he
was
uneasy
in
the
captain's
presence
However
I
did
not
wish
to
leave
the
quarterdeck
as
if
retreating
from
it
Cumbershum
said
I
the
motion
is
easier
Show
more
of
our
ship
Or
if
you
feel
it
inadvisable
to
interrupt
the
management
of
her
lend
me
this
young
fellow
to
be
my
conductor
The
young
fellow
in
question
Cumbershum's
satellite
was
a
midshipman
not
one
of
your
ancients
stuck
in
his
inferior
position
like
a
goat
in
a
bush
but
an
example
of
the
breed
that
brings
a
tear
to
every
maternal
eye
in
a
sentence
a
pustular
lad
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
addressed
as
I
soon
found
in
pious
hope
as
a
Young
Gentleman
It
was
some
time
before
Cumbershum
answered
me
the
lad
looking
from
the
one
to
the
other
of
us
meanwhile
At
last
Mr
Cumbershum
said
the
lad
Mr
Willis
by
name
might
go
with
me
So
my
object
was
gained
I
left
the
Sacred
Precincts
with
dignity
and
indeed
had
despoiled
it
of
a
votary
As
we
descended
the
ladder
there
was
a
hail
from
Mr
Cumbershum
Mr
Willis
Mr
Willis!
Do
not
omit
to
invite
Mr
Talbot
to
glance
at
the
captain's
Standing
Orders
You
may
transmit
to
me
any
suggestions
he
has
for
their
improvement
I
laughed
heartily
at
this
sally
though
Willis
did
not
seem
to
be
amused
by
it
He
is
not
merely
pustular
but
pale
and
he
commonly
lets
his
mouth
hang
open
He
asked
me
what
I
would
choose
to
see
and
I
had
no
idea
having
used
him
to
get
me
off
the
quarterdeck
suitably
attended
I
nodded
towards
the
forward
part
of
the
vessel
Let
us
stroll
thither
said
I
and
see
how
the
people
live
Willis
followed
me
with
some
hesitation
in
the
shadow
of
the
boats
on
the
boom
across
the
white
line
at
the
main
mast
then
between
the
pens
where
our
beasts
are
kept
He
passed
me
then
and
led
the
way
up
a
ladder
to
the
front
or
fo'castle
where
was
the
capstan
some
loungers
and
a
woman
plucking
a
chicken
I
went
towards
the
bowsprit
and
looked
down
I
became
aware
of
the
age
of
this
old
crone
of
a
ship
for
she
is
positively
beaked
in
the
manner
of
the
last
century
and
flimsy
I
should
judge
about
the
bow
withal
I
looked
over
her
monstrous
figurehead
emblem
of
her
name
and
which
our
people
as
is
their
custom
have
turned
colloquially
into
an
obscenity
with
which
I
will
not
trouble
your
lordship
But
the
sight
of
the
men
down
there
squatting
in
the
heads
at
their
business
was
distasteful
and
some
of
them
looked
up
at
me
with
what
seemed
like
impertinence
I
turned
away
and
gazed
along
her
vast
length
and
to
the
vaster
expanse
of
dark
blue
ocean
that
surrounded
us
Well
sir
said
I
to
Willis
we
are
certainly
vp
a
are
we
not
Willis
replied
that
he
did
not
know
French
What
do
you
know
then
lad
The
rigging
sir
the
parts
of
the
ship
bends
and
hitches
the
points
of
the
compass
the
marks
of
the
leadline
to
take
a
bearing
off
a
point
of
land
or
a
mark
and
to
shoot
the
sun
We
are
in
good
hands
I
see
There
is
more
than
that
sir
said
he
as
for
example
the
parts
of
a
gun
the
composition
of
powder
to
sweeten
the
bilge
and
the
Articles
of
War
You
must
not
sweeten
the
Articles
of
War
said
I
solemnly
We
must
not
be
kinder
to
each
other
than
the
French
are
to
us!
It
seems
to
me
that
your
education
is
piled
all
on
top
of
itself
like
my
lady
mother's
sewing
closet!
But
what
is
the
composition
of
the
powder
that
enables
you
to
shoot
the
sun
and
should
you
not
be
careful
lest
you
damage
the
source
of
light
and
put
the
day
out
Willis
laughed
noisily
You
are
roasting
me
sir
he
said
Even
a
landlubber
I
ask
your
pardon
knows
what
shooting
the
sun
is
I
forgive
you
that
even
sir!
When
shall
I
see
you
do
so
Take
an
observation
sir
Why
at
noon
in
a
few
minutes
There
will
be
Mr
Smiles
the
sailing
master
Mr
Davies
and
Mr
Taylor
the
other
two
midshipmen
sir
though
Mr
Davies
does
not
really
know
how
to
do
it
for
all
that
he
is
so
old
and
Mr
Taylor
my
friend
I
beg
you
will
not
mention
it
to
the
Captain
has
a
sextant
that
does
not
work
owing
to
his
having
pawned
the
one
that
his
father
gave
him
So
we
have
agreed
to
take
turn
with
mine
and
give
altitudes
that
are
two
minutes
different
I
put
my
hand
to
my
forehead
And
the
safety
of
the
whole
hangs
by
such
a
spider's
thread!
Sir
Our
position
my
boy!
Good
God
we
might
as
well
be
in
the
hands
of
my
young
brothers!
Is
our
position
to
be
decided
by
an
antique
midshipman
and
a
sextant
that
does
not
work
Lord
no
sir!
In
the
first
place
Tommy
Taylor
and
I
believe
we
may
persuade
Mr
Davies
to
swap
his
good
one
for
Tommy's
instrument
It
would
not
really
matter
to
Mr
Davies
you
see
Besides
sir
Captain
Anderson
Mr
Smiles
and
some
other
officers
are
also
engaged
in
the
navigation
I
see
You
do
not
merely
shoot
the
sun
You
subject
him
to
a
British
Broadside!
I
shall
watch
with
interest
and
perhaps
take
a
hand
in
shooting
the
sun
too
as
we
roll
round
him
You
could
not
do
that
sir
said
Willis
in
what
seemed
a
kindly
way
We
wait
here
for
the
sun
to
climb
up
the
sky
and
we
measure
the
angle
when
it
is
greatest
and
take
the
time
too
Now
look
lad
said
I
You
are
taking
us
back
into
the
Middle
Ages!
You
will
be
quoting
Ptolemy
at
me
next!
I
do
not
know
of
him
sir
But
we
must
wait
while
the
sun
climbs
up
That
is
no
more
than
an
apparent
movement
said
I
patiently
Do
you
not
know
of
Galileo
and
his
Eppur
si
muove
The
earth
goes
round
the
sun!
The
motion
was
described
by
Copernicus
and
confirmed
by
Kepler!
The
lad
answered
me
with
the
purest
simplicity
ignorance
and
dignity
Sir
I
do
not
know
how
the
sun
may
behave
among
those
gentlemen
ashore
but
I
know
that
he
climbs
up
the
sky
in
the
Royal
Navy
I
laughed
again
and
laid
my
hand
on
the
boy's
shoulder
And
so
he
shall!
Let
him
move
as
he
chooses!
To
tell
you
the
truth
Mr
Willis
I
am
so
glad
to
see
him
up
there
with
the
snowy
clouds
about
him
that
he
may
dance
a
jig
for
all
I
care!
Look
your
companions
are
gathering
Be
off
with
you
and
aim
your
instrument!
He
thanked
me
and
dived
away
I
stood
on
the
aftermost
part
of
the
fo'castle
and
looked
back
at
the
ceremony
which
I
own
pleased
me
There
was
a
number
of
officers
on
the
quarterdeck
They
waited
on
the
sun
the
brass
triangles
held
to
their
faces
Now
here
was
a
curious
and
moving
circumstance
All
those
of
the
ship's
people
who
were
on
deck
and
some
of
the
emigrants
too
turned
and
watched
this
rite
with
silent
attention
They
could
not
be
expected
to
understand
the
mathematics
of
the
operation
That
I
have
some
notion
of
it
myself
is
owing
to
education
an
inveterate
curiosity
and
a
facility
in
learning
Even
the
passengers
or
those
of
them
on
deck
stood
at
gaze
I
should
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
the
gentlemen
lift
their
hats!
But
the
people
I
mean
the
common
sort
whose
lives
as
much
as
ours
depended
on
an
accuracy
of
measurement
beyond
their
comprehension
and
the
appli-
cation
of
formulae
that
would
be
as
opaque
to
them
as
Chinese
writing
these
people
I
say
accorded
the
whole
operation
a
respect
such
as
they
might
have
paid
the
solemnest
moment
of
a
religious
service
You
might
be
inclined
to
think
as
I
did
that
the
glittering
instruments
were
their
Mumbo
Jumbo
Indeed
Mr
Davies's
ignorance
and
Mr
Taylor's
defective
instrument
were
feet
of
clay
but
I
felt
they
might
have
a
justifiable
faith
in
some
of
the
older
officers!
And
then--their
attitudes!
The
woman
watched
the
half-plucked
hen
in
her
lap
Two
fellows
who
were
carrying
a
sick
girl
up
from
below--why
even
they
stood
and
watched
as
if
someone
had
said
hist
while
their
burden
lay
helplessly
between
them
Then
the
girl
too
turned
her
head
and
watched
where
they
watched
There
was
a
moving
and
endearing
pathos
about
their
attention
as
in
a
dog
that
watches
a
conversation
it
cannot
possibly
understand
I
am
not
as
your
lordship
must
be
aware
a
friend
of
those
who
approve
the
outrageous
follies
of
democracy
in
this
and
the
last
century
But
at
the
moment
when
I
saw
a
number
of
our
sailors
in
a
posture
of
such
intense
regard
I
came
as
near
as
ever
I
have
done
to
seeing
such
concepts
as
duty
privilege
and
authority
in
a
new
light
They
moved
out
of
books
out
of
the
schoolroom
and
university
into
the
broader
scenes
of
daily
life
Indeed
until
I
saw
these
fellows
like
Milton's
hungry
sheep
that
look
up
I
had
not
considered
the
nature
of
my
own
ambitions
nor
looked
for
the
justification
of
them
that
was
here
presented
to
me
Forgive
me
for
boring
your
lordship
with
my
discovery
of
what
you
yourself
must
know
so
well
How
noble
was
the
prospect!
Our
vessel
was
urged
forward
under
the
force
of
sufficient
but
not
excessive
wind
the
billows
sparkled
the
white
clouds
were
diversedly
mirrored
in
the
deep
et
cetera
The
sun
resisted
without
apparent
effort
our
naval
broadside!
I
went
down
the
ladder
and
walked
back
towards
where
our
navigators
were
breaking
from
their
rank
and
descending
from
the
quarterdeck
Mr
Smiles
the
sailing
master
is
old
but
not
as
old
as
Mr
Davies
our
senior
midshipman
who
is
nearly
as
old
as
the
ship!
He
descended
not
merely
the
ladder
to
the
level
of
the
waist
where
I
was
but
the
next
one
down
as
well
going
away
with
a
slow
and
broken
motion
for
all
the
world
like
a
stage
apparition
returning
to
the
tomb
After
leave
obtained
Mr
Willis
my
young
acquaintance
brought
his
companion
to
me
with
some
ceremony
Mr
Tommy
Taylor
must
be
a
clear
two
years
younger
than
Mr
Willis
but
has
the
spirit
and
well-knit
frame
that
his
elder
lacks
Mr
Taylor
is
from
a
naval
family
He
explained
at
once
that
Mr
Willis
was
weak
in
his
attic
and
needed
retiling
I
was
to
come
to
him
Mr
Taylor
if
I
wished
to
find
out
about
navigation
since
Mr
Willis
would
soon
have
me
on
the
rocks
Only
the
day
before
he
had
informed
Mr
Deverel
that
at
the
latitude
of
sixty
degrees
north
a
degree
of
longitude
would
be
reduced
to
half
a
nautical
mile
On
Mr
Deverel
asking
him
evidently
a
wag
Mr
Deverel
what
it
would
be
reduced
to
at
sixty
degrees
south
Mr
Willis
had
replied
that
he
had
not
got
as
far
as
that
in
the
book
The
memory
of
these
cataclysmic
errors
sent
Mr
Taylor
into
a
long
peal
of
laughter
which
Mr
Willis
did
not
appear
to
resent
He
is
devoted
to
his
young
friend
evidently
admires
him
and
shows
him
off
to
the
best
advantage
Behold
me
then
pacing
to
and
fro
between
the
break
of
the
afterdeck
and
the
mainmast
a
young
acolyte
on
either
side
the
younger
one
on
my
starboard
hand
full
of
excitement
information
opinion
gusto
the
other
silent
but
smiling
with
open
mouth
and
nodding
at
his
young
friend's
expressions
of
opinion
on
any
subject
under
and
indeed
including
the
sun!

AND
SAT
STILL
WHILE
A
LOW

BURRED
LIKE
A

ONE

HOLDING
THE

JIM

SHUFFLED

THE
YOUNG
MARY
AS
THEY
TOPPED
THE
CREST
OF
THE
HILL
AND
LOOKED
DOWN
INTO
THE
VALLEY
STANTON-IN-TEESDALE
LAY
BELOW
THEM
BLACK
WITH
ITS

AND
ITS
SOOTY

THE

TRAILED
ENORMOUS

PLEASES
AND
ONLY
MAN

VILE
QUOTED
HER
BROTHER
GEORGE
THE
OTHER
YOUNG
MAN
WAS
MORE
PRACTICALLY
MINDED
IF
ONE
COULD
PLANT
A
BATTERY
HERE
HE
SUGGESTED
AND
DROP
A
FEW
HUNDRED
ROUNDS
ONTO
THE

IT
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
THING
SAID
MARY
EMPHATICALLY
A
REALLY
GOOD
THING
HER

FILLED
THE
MILITARY
YOUNG
MAN
WITH

HE
WAS
DESPERATELY
IN
LOVE
HEAVY
HOWITZERS
HE
ADDED
TRYING
TO
IMPROVE
ON
HIS
SUGGESTION
BUT
GEORGE
INTERRUPTED
HIM
WHO
THE
DEVIL
IS
THAT
HE
ASKED
THE
OTHERS
LOOKED
ROUND
IN
THE
DIRECTION
HE
WAS
POINTING
A
STRANGER
WAS
WALKING
UP
THE
HILL
TOWARDS
THEM
NO
IDEA
SAID
MARY
LOOKING
AT
HIM
THE
STRANGER
APPROACHED
HE
WAS
A
YOUNG
MAN
IN
THE
EARLY
TWENTIES
HOOK-NOSED
WITH
BLUE
EYES
AND
SILKY
PALE
HAIR
THAT
BLEW
ABOUT
IN
THE
WIND
FOR
HE
WORE
NO
HAT
HE
HAD
ON
A
NORFOLK
JACKET
ILL
CUT
AND
OF
CHEAP
MATERIAL
AND
A
PAIR
OF
BAGGY
GREY
FLANNEL
TROUSERS
HIS

WAS
RED
HE
WALKED
WITHOUT
A
STICK
LOOKS
AS
IF
HE
WANTED
TO
TALK
TO
US
SAID
GEORGE
AND
INDEED
THE
YOUNG
MAN
WAS
COMING
STRAIGHT
TOWARDS
THEM
HE
WALKED
RAPIDLY
AND
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
DETERMINATION
AS
THOUGH
HE
WERE
ON
SOME
VERY
IMPORTANT
BUSINESS
WHAT
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
FACE!
THOUGHT
MARY
AS
HE
APPROACHED
BUT
HOW
ILL
HE
LOOKS!
SO
THIN
SO
PALE
BUT
HIS
EYES
FORBADE
HER
TO
FEEL
PITY
THEY
WERE
BRIGHT
WITH
POWER
HE
CAME
TO
A
HALT
IN
FRONT
OF
THEM
DRAWING
UP
HIS
THIN
BODY
VERY
RIGIDLY
AS
THOUGH
HE
WERE
ON
PARADE
THERE
WAS
DEFIANCE
IN
THE
ATTITUDE
AN
EARNEST
DEFIANCE
IN
THE
EXPRESSION
OF
HIS
FACE
HE
LOOKED
AT
THEM
FIXEDLY
WITH
HIS
BRIGHT
EYES
TURNING
FROM
ONE
TO
THE
OTHER
GOOD
AFTERNOON
HE
SAID
IT
WAS
COSTING
HIM
AN
ENORMOUS
EFFORT
TO
SPEAK
BUT
SPEAK
HE
MUST
JUST
BECAUSE
OF
THAT
INSOLENT
UNAWARENESS
IN
THEIR
BLANK
RICH
FACES
MARY
ANSWERED
FOR
THE
OTHERS
GOOD
AFTERNOON
I'M
TRESPASSING
HERE
SAID
THE
STRANGER
DO
YOU
MIND
THE
SERIOUSNESS
OF
HIS
DEFIANCE
DEEPENED
HE
LOOKED
AT
THEM
SOMBRELY
THE
YOUNG
MEN
WERE
EXAMINING
HIM
FROM
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
BARS
FROM
A
LONG
WAY
OFF
FROM
THE
VANTAGE
GROUND
OF
ANOTHER
CLASS
THEY
HAD
NOTICED
HIS
CLOTHES
THERE
WAS
HOSTILITY
AND
CONTEMPT
IN
THEIR
EYES
THERE
WAS
ALSO
A
KIND
OF
FEAR
I'M
A
TRESPASSER
HE
REPEATED
HIS
VOICE
WAS
RATHER
SHRILL
BUT
MUSICAL
HIS
ACCENT
WAS
OF
THE
COUNTRY
ONE
OF
THE
LOCAL
CADS
GEORGE
HAD
BEEN
THINKING
A
TRESPASSER
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MUCH
EASIER
MUCH
PLEASANTER
TO
SNEAK
OUT
UNOBSERVED
THAT
WAS
WHY
HE
HAD
TO
AFFRONT
THEM
THERE
WAS
A
SILENCE
THE
MILITARY
MAN
TURNED
AWAY
HE
DISSOCIATED
HIMSELF
FROM
THE
WHOLE
UNPLEASANT
BUSINESS
IT
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
HIM
AFTER
ALL
THE
PARK
BELONGED
TO
MARY'S
FATHER
HE
WAS
ONLY
A
GUEST
I'VE
GOTTA
MOTTA
ALWAYS
MERRY
AND
BRIGHT
HE
HUMMED
TO
HIMSELF
AS
HE
LOOKED
OUT
OVER
THE
BLACK

IN
THE

IT
WAS
GEORGE
WHO
BROKE
THE
SILENCE
DO
WE

HE

REPEATING
THE
STRANGER'S

HAD
GONE
VERY
RED
HOW
ABSURD
HE
LOOKS!
THOUGHT
MARY
AS
SHE
GLANCED
AT
HIM
LIKE
A
BULL
CALF
A
BLUSHING
BULL
CALF
DO
WE
MIND
DAMNED
INSOLENT
LITTLE
BOUNDER!
GEORGE
WAS
WORKING
UP
A
RIGHTEOUS
INDIGNATION
I
SHOULD
JUST
THINK
WE
DO
MIND
AND
I'LL
TROUBLE
YOU
TO
MARY
BROKE
OUT
INTO
LAUGHTER
WE
DON'T
MIND
AT
ALL
SHE
SAID
NOT
IN
THE
LEAST
HER
BROTHER'S
FACE
BECAME
EVEN
REDDER
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
MARY
HE
ASKED
FURIOUSLY
ALWAYS
MERRY
AND
BRIGHT
HUMMED
THE
MILITARY
MAN
MORE
STARRILY
DETACHED
THAN
EVER
THE
PLACE
IS
PRIVATE
BUT
WE
DON'T
MIND
A
BIT
SHE
SAID
NOT
LOOKING
AT
HER
BROTHER
BUT
AT
THE
STRANGER
NOT
A
BIT
WHEN
PEOPLE
COME
AND
ARE
FRANK
ABOUT
IT
LIKE
YOU
SHE
SMILED
AT
HIM
BUT
THE
YOUNG
MAN'S
FACE
REMAINED
AS
PROUDLY
SERIOUS
AS
EVER
LOOKING
INTO
THOSE
SERIOUS
BRIGHT
EYES
SHE
TOO
SUDDENLY
BECAME
SERIOUS
IT
WAS
NO
JOKE
SHE
SAW
ALL
AT
ONCE
NO
JOKE
GRAVE
ISSUES
WERE
INVOLVED
IMPORTANT
ISSUES
BUT
WHY
GRAVE
AND
IN
WHAT
WAY
IMPORTANT
SHE
DID
NOT
KNOW
SHE
WAS
ONLY
OBSCURELY
AND
PROFOUNDLY
AWARE
THAT
IT
WAS
NO
JOKE
GOOD-BYE
SHE
SAID
IN
AN
ALTERED
VOICE
AND
HELD
OUT
HER
HAND
THE
STRANGER
HESITATED
FOR
A
SECOND
THEN
TOOK
IT
GOOD-BYE
HE
SAID
I'LL
GET
OUT
OF
THE
PARK
AS
QUICK
AS
I
CAN
AND
TURNING
ROUND
HE
WALKED
RAPIDLY
AWAY
WHAT
THE
DEVIL!
GEORGE
BEGAN
TURNING
ANGRILY
ON
HIS
SISTER
OH
HOLD
YOUR
TONGUE!
SHE
ANSWERED
IMPATIENTLY
SHAKING
HANDS
WITH
THE
FELLOW
HE
WENT
ON
PROTESTING
A
BIT
OF
A
PLEB
WASN'T
HE
PUT
IN
THE
MILITARY
FRIEND
SHE
LOOKED
FROM
ONE
TO
THE
OTHER
WITHOUT
SPEAKING
AND
WALKED
AWAY
WHAT
LOUTS
THEY
WERE!
THE
TWO
YOUNG
MEN
FOLLOWED
I
WISH
TO
GOD
MARY
WOULD
LEARN
HOW
TO
BEHAVE
HERSELF
PROPERLY
SAID
GEORGE
STILL
FUMING
THE
MILITARY
YOUNG
MAN
MADE
DEPRECATING
NOISES
HE
WAS
IN
LOVE
WITH
HER
BUT
HE
HAD
TO
ADMIT
THAT
SHE
WAS
RATHER
EMBARRASSINGLY
UNCONVENTIONAL
SOMETIMES
IT
WAS
HER
ONLY
DEFECT
SHAKING
THAT
BOUNDER'S
HAND!
GEORGE
WENT
ON
GRUMBLING
THAT
WAS
THEIR
FIRST
MEETING
MARY
THEN
WAS
TWENTY-TWO
AND
MARK
RAMPION
A
YEAR
YOUNGER
HE
HAD
FINISHED
HIS
SECOND
YEAR
AT
SHEFFIELD
UNIVERSITY
AND
WAS
BACK
AT
STANTON
FOR
THE
SUMMER
VACATION
HIS
MOTHER
LIVED
IN
ONE
OF
A
ROW
OF
COTTAGES
NEAR
THE
STATION
SHE
HAD
A
LITTLE
PENSION
HER
HUSBAND
HAD
BEEN
A
POSTMAN
AND
MADE
A
FEW
EXTRA
SHILLINGS
BY
SEWING
MARK
WAS
A
SCHOLARSHIP
BOY
HIS
YOUNGER
AND
LESS
TALENTED
BROTHERS
WERE
ALREADY
AT
WORK
A
VERY
REMARKABLE
YOUNG
MAN
THE
RECTOR
INSISTED
MORE
THAN
ONCE
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
HIS
SKETCH
OF
MARK
RAMPION'S
CAREER
SOME
FEW
DAYS
LATER
THE
OCCASION
WAS
A
CHURCH

PARTY
AT
THE

SOME
OF
THE
SUNDAY
SCHOOL
CHILDREN
HAD
ACTED
A

THE

WAS

QUITE
UNASSISTED
THE

ASSURED
THE
ASSEMBLED
GENTRY
AND
WHAT'S
MORE
THE
LAD
CAN
DRAW
THEY'RE
A
LITTLE
ECCENTRIC
PERHAPS
HIS
PICTURES
A
LITTLE
AH
HE
HESITATED
WEIRD
SUGGESTED
HIS
DAUGHTER
WITH
AN
UPPER
MIDDLE-CLASS
SMILE
PROUD
OF
HER
INCOMPREHENSION
BUT
FULL
OF
TALENT
THE
RECTOR
CONTINUED
THE
BOY'S
A
REAL
CYGNET
OF
TEES
HE
ADDED
WITH
A
SELF-CONSCIOUS
ALMOST
GUILTY
LAUGH
HE
HAD
A
WEAKNESS
FOR
LITERARY
ALLUSIONS
THE
GENTRY
SMILED
PERFUNCTORILY
THE
PRODIGY
WAS
INTRODUCED
MARY
RECOGNIZED
THE
TRESPASSER
I'VE
MET
YOU
BEFORE
SHE
SAID
POACHING
YOUR
VIEW
YOU'RE
WELCOME
TO
IT
THE
WORDS
MADE
HIM
SMILE
A
LITTLE
IRONICALLY
IT
SEEMED
TO
HER
SHE
BLUSHED
FEARFUL
LEST
SHE
HAD
SAID
SOMETHING
THAT
MIGHT
HAVE
SOUNDED
RATHER
PATRONIZING
BUT
I
SUPPOSE
YOU'D
GO
ON
POACHING
WHETHER
YOU
WERE
WELCOME
OR
NOT
SHE
ADDED
WITH
A
NERVOUS
LITTLE
LAUGH
HE
SAID
NOTHING
BUT
NODDED
STILL
SMILING
MARY'S
FATHER
STEPPED
IN
WITH
CONGRATULATIONS
HIS
PRAISES
WENT
TRAMPLING
OVER
THE
DELICATE
LITTLE
PLAY
LIKE
A
HERD
OF
ELEPHANTS
MARY
WRITHED
IT
WAS
ALL
WRONG
HOPELESSLY
WRONG
SHE
COULD
FEEL
THAT
BUT
THE
TROUBLE
AS
SHE
REALIZED
WAS
THAT
SHE
COULDN'T
HAVE
SAID
ANYTHING
BETTER
HERSELF
THE
IRONIC
SMILE
STILL
LINGERED
ABOUT
HIS
LIPS
WHAT
FOOLS
HE
MUST
THINK
US
ALL!
SHE
SAID
TO
HERSELF
AND
NOW
IT
WAS
HER
MOTHER'S
TURN
JOLLY
GOOD
WAS
REPLACED
BY
TOO
CHARMING
WHICH
WAS
JUST
AS
BAD
JUST
AS
HOPELESSLY
BESIDE
THE
POINT
WHEN
MRS
FELPHAM
ASKED
HIM
TO
TEA
RAMPION
WANTED
TO
REFUSE
THE
INVITATION
BUT
TO
REFUSE
IT
WITHOUT
BEING
BOORISH
OR
OFFENSIVE
AFTER
ALL
SHE
MEANT
WELL
ENOUGH
POOR
WOMAN
SHE
WAS
ONLY
RATHER
LUDICROUS

IN

PATRONIZING
ART
TO
THE
EXTENT
OF
TWO
CUPS
OF

AND

THE
RLE
WAS
A
COMIC
ONE
WHILE
HE
WAS
HESITATING
MARY
JOINED
IN
THE
INVITATION
DO
COME
SHE
INSISTED
AND
HER
EYES
HER
SMILE
EXPRESSED
A
KIND
OF
RUEFUL
AMUSEMENT
AND
AN
APOLOGY
SHE
SAW
THE
ABSURDITY
OF
THE
SITUATION
BUT
I
CAN'T
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
SHE
SEEMED
TO
SAY
NOTHING
AT
ALL
EXCEPT
APOLOGIZE
I
SHOULD
LIKE
TO
COME
VERY
MUCH
HE
SAID
TURNING
BACK
TO
MRS
FELPHAM
THE
APPOINTED
DAY
CAME
HIS

AS
RED
AS
EVER
RAMPION
PRESENTED
HIMSELF
THE
MEN
WERE
OUT

HE
WAS
RECEIVED
BY
MARY
AND
HER

MRS

TRIED
TO

TO
THE
OCCASION
THE
VILLAGE
SHAKESPEARE
IT
WAS
OBVIOUS
MUST
BE
INTERESTED
IN
THE
DRAMA
DON'T
YOU
LOVE
BARRIE'S
PLAYS
SHE
ASKED
I'M
SO
FOND
OF
THEM
SHE
TALKED
ON
RAMPION
MADE
NO
COMMENT
IT
WAS
ONLY
LATER
WHEN
MRS
FELPHAM
HAD
GIVEN
HIM
UP
AS
A
BAD
JOB
AND
HAD
COMMISSIONED
MARY
TO
SHOW
HIM
ROUND
THE
GARDEN
THAT
HE
OPENED
HIS
LIPS
I'M
AFRAID
YOUR

AS

NOT

PROTESTED
WITH
AN

THANK

HE
SAID
BUT
OF

SHE
DID
BECAUSE
I
WAS
RUDE
I
WAS
RUDE
IN

THAT
I
SHOULDN'T
BE
RUDER
BETTER
SAY
NOTHING
THAN
SAY
WHAT

DON'T

I

I
HE
STOPPED
AND

AT

THE

RUSHED
UP
INTO

HE'S
AN
INSULT
THERE
WAS
A
SILENCE
THEY
WALKED
UP
AND
DOWN
AMONG
THE
ROSES
THOSE
ROSES
WHICH
MARY
WAS
FEELING
THAT
SHE
OUGHT
TO
DISCLAIM
TO
APOLOGIZE
FOR
BUT
A
DISCLAIMER
AN
APOLOGY
WOULD
BE
AN
OFFENCE
A

STOOD
UP

I
THINK
I
LIKE

BETTER

SHE
SAID
AS
SHE
PROTECTED
HERSELF
FROM
ITS
PONDEROUS
PLAYFULNESS
WELL
AT

THEY'RE
GENUINE
THEY
DON'T
LIVE
ON

WAS

AND
DELIGHTED
BY
THE
WAY
HE
UNDERSTOOD
I'D
LIKE
TO
KNOW
MORE

ARE
YOU
SURE
HE
ASKED
HER
WHEN

IT'S
DIFFICULT
NOT

There
is
in
the
Midlands
a
single-line
tramway
system
which
boldly
leaves
the
county
town
and
plunges
off
into
the
black
industrial
country-side
up
hill
and
down
dale
through
the
long
ugly
villages
of
workmen's
houses
over
canals
and
railways
past
churches
perched
high
and
nobly
over
the
smoke
and
shadows
through
stark
grimy
cold
little
market-places
tilting
away
in
a
rush
past
cinemas
and
shops
down
to
the
hollow
where
the
collieries
are
then
up
again
past
a
little
rural
church
under
the
ash
trees
on
in
a
rush
to
the
terminus
the
last
little
ugly
place
of
industry
the
cold
little
town
that
shivers
on
the
edge
of
the
wild
gloomy
country
beyond
There
the
green
and
creamy
coloured
tram-car
seems
to
pause
and
purr
with
curious
satisfaction
But
in
a
few
minutes
the
clock
on
the
turret
of
the
Co-operative
Wholesale
Society's
Shops
gives
the
time
away
it
starts
once
more
on
the
adventure
Again
there
are
the
reckless
swoops
downhill
bouncing
the
loops
again
the
chilly
wait
in
the
hill-top
market-place
again
the
breathless
slithering
round
the
precipitous
drop
under
the
church
again
the
patient
halts
at
the
loops
waiting
for
the
outcoming
car
so
on
and
on
for
two
long
hours
till
at
last
the
city
looms
beyond
the
fat
gas-works
the
narrow
factories
draw
near
we
are
in
the
sordid
streets
of
the
great
town
once
more
we
sidle
to
a
standstill
at
our
terminus
abashed
by
the
great
crimson
and
creamcoloured
city
cars
but
still
perky
jaunty
somewhat
dare-devil
green
as
a
jaunty
sprig
of
parsley
out
of
a
black
colliery
garden
To
ride
on
these
cars
is
always
an
adventure
Since
we
are
in
war-time
the
drivers
are
men
unfit
for
active
service
cripples
and
hunchbacks
So
they
have
the
spirit
of
the
devil
in
them
The
ride
becomes
a
steeplechase
Hurray!
we
have
leapt
in
a
clear
jump
over
the
canal
bridge
now
for
the
four-lane
corner
With
a
shriek
and
a
trail
of
sparks
we
are
clear
again
To
be
sure
a
tram
often
leaps
the
rails
but
what
matter!
It
sits
in
a
ditch
till
other
trams
come
to
haul
it
out
It
is
quite
common
for
a
car
packed
with
one
solid
mass
of
living
people
to
come
to
a
dead
halt
in
the
midst
of
unbroken
blackness
the
heart
of
nowhere
on
a
dark
night
and
for
the
driver
and
the
girl
conductor
to
call
All
get
off
car's
on
fire!
Instead
however
of
rushing
out
in
a
panic
the
passengers
stolidly
reply
Get
on
get
on!
We're
not
coming
out
We're
stopping
where
we
are
Push
on
George
So
till
flames
actually
appear
The
reason
for
this
reluctance
to
dismount
is
that
the
nights
are
howlingly
cold
black
and
windswept
and
a
car
is
a
haven
of
refuge
From
village
to
village
the
miners
travel
for
a
change
of
cinema
of
girl
of
pub
The
trams
are
desperately
packed
Who
is
going
to
risk
himself
in
the
black
gulf
outside
to
wait
perhaps
an
hour
for
another
tram
then
to
see
the
forlorn
notice
Depot
Only
because
there
is
something
wrong!
Or
to
greet
a
unit
of
three
bright
cars
all
so
tight
with
people
that
they
sail
past
with
a
howl
of
derision
Trams
that
pass
in
the
night
This
the
most
dangerous
tram-service
in
England
as
the
authorities
themselves
declare
with
pride
is
entirely
conducted
by
girls
and
driven
by
rash
young
men
a
little
crippled
or
by
delicate
young
men
who
creep
forward
in
terror
The
girls
are
fearless
young
hussies
In
their
ugly
blue
uniform
skirts
up
to
their
knees
shapeless
old
peaked
caps
on
their
heads
they
have
all
the
sang-froid
of
an
old
non-commissioned
officer
With
a
tram
packed
with
howling
colliers
roaring
hymns
downstairs
and
a
sort
of
antiphony
of
obscenities
upstairs
the
lasses
are
perfectly
at
their
ease
They
pounce
on
the
youths
who
try
to
evade
their
ticket-machine
They
push
off
the
men
at
the
end
of
their
distance
They
are
not
going
to
be
done
in
the
eye
not
they
They
fear
nobody
and
everybody
fears
them
Hello
Annie!
Hello
Ted!
Oh
mind
my
corn
Miss
Stone
It's
my
belief
you've
got
a
heart
of
stone
for
you've
trod
on
it
again
You
should
keep
it
in
your
pocket
replies
Miss
Stone
and
she
goes
sturdily
upstairs
in
her
high
boots
Tickets
please
She
is
peremptory
suspicious
and
ready
to
hit
first
She
can
hold
her
own
against
ten
thousand
The
step
of
that
tram-car
is
her
Thermopylae
Therefore
there
is
a
certain
wild
romance
aboard
these
cars
and
in
the
sturdy
bosom
of
Annie
herself
The
time
for
soft
romance
is
in
the
morning
between
ten
o'clock
and
one
when
things
are
rather
slack
that
is
except
market-day
and
Saturday
Thus
Annie
has
time
to
look
about
her
Then
she
often
hops
off
her
car
and
into
a
shop
where
she
has
spied
something
while
the
driver
chats
in
the
main
road
There
is
very
good
feeling
between
the
girls
and
the
drivers
Are
they
not
companions
in
peril
shipments
aboard
this
careering
vessel
of
a
tram-car
for
ever
rocking
on
the
waves
of
a
stormy
land
Then
also
during
the
easy
hours
the
inspectors
are
most
in
evidence
For
some
reason
everybody
employed
in
this
tram-service
is
young
there
are
no
grey
heads
It
would
not
do
Therefore
the
inspectors
are
of
the
right
age
and
one
the
chief
is
also
good-looking
See
him
stand
on
a
wet
gloomy
morning
in
his
long
oilskin
his
peaked
cap
well
down
over
his
eyes
waiting
to
board
a
car
His
face
is
ruddy
his
small
brown
moustache
is
weathered
he
has
a
faint
impudent
smile
Fairly
tall
and
agile
even
in
his
waterproof
he
springs
aboard
a
car
and
greets
Annie
Hello
Annie!
Keeping
the
wet
out
Trying
to
There
are
only
two
people
in
the
car
Inspecting
is
soon
over
Then
for
a
long
and
impudent
chat
on
the
foot-board
a
good
easy
twelve-mile
chat
The
inspector's
name
is
John
Thomas
Raynor
always
called
John
Thomas
except
sometimes
in
malice
Coddy
His
face
sets
in
fury
when
he
is
addressed
from
a
distance
with
this
abbreviation
There
is
considerable
scandal
about
John
Thomas
in
half
a
dozen
villages
He
flirts
with
the
girl
conductors
in
the
morning
and
walks
out
with
them
in
the
dark
night
when
they
leave
their
tram-car
at
the
depot
Of
course
the
girls
quit
the
service
frequently
Then
he
flirts
and
walks
out
with
the
newcomer
always
providing
she
is
sufficiently
attractive
and
that
she
will
consent
to
walk
It
is
remarkable
however
that
most
of
the
girls
are
quite
comely
they
are
all
young
and
this
roving
life
aboard
the
car
gives
them
a
sailor's
dash
and
recklessness
What
matter
how
they
behave
when
the
ship
is
in
port
To-morrow
they
will
be
aboard
again
Annie
however
was
something
of
a
Tartar
and
her
sharp
tongue
had
kept
John
Thomas
at
arm's
length
for
many
months
Perhaps
therefore
she
liked
him
all
the
more
for
he
always
came
up
smiling
with
impudence
She
watched
him
vanquish
one
girl
then
another
She
could
tell
by
the
movement
of
his
mouth
and
eyes
when
he
flirted
with
her
in
the
morning
that
he
had
been
walking
out
with
this
lass
or
the
other
the
night
before
A
fine
cock-of-the-walk
he
was
She
could
sum
him
up
pretty
well
In
this
subtle
antagonism
they
knew
each
other
like
old
friends
they
were
as
shrewd
with
one
another
almost
as
man
and
wife
But
Annie
had
always
kept
him
sufficiently
at
arm's
length
Besides
she
had
a
boy
of
her
own
The
Statutes
fair
however
came
in
November
at
Bestwood
It
happened
that
Annie
had
the
Monday
night
off
It
was
a
drizzling
ugly
night
yet
she
dressed
herself
up
and
went
to
the
fair-ground
She
was
alone
but
she
expected
soon
to
find
a
pal
of
some
sort
The
roundabouts
were
veering
round
and
grinding
out
their
music
the
side-shows
were
making
as
much
commotion
as
possible
In
the
coconut
shies
there
were
no
coconuts
but
artificial
war-time
substitutes
which
the
lads
declared
were
fastened
into
the
irons
There
was
a
sad
decline
in
brilliance
and
luxury
None
the
less
the
ground
was
muddy
as
ever
there
was
the
same
crush
the
press
of
faces
lighted
up
by
the
flares
and
the
electric
lights
the
same
smell
of
naphtha
and
a
few
potatoes
and
of
electricity
Who
should
be
the
first
to
greet
Miss
Annie
on
the
show
ground
but
John
Thomas
He
had
a
black
overcoat
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
and
a
tweed
cap
pulled
down
over
his
brows
his
face
between
was
ruddy
and
smiling
and
handy
as
ever
She
knew
so
well
the
way
his
mouth
moved
She
was
very
glad
to
have
a
boy
To
be
at
the
Statutes
without
a
fellow
was
no
fun
Instantly
like
the
gallant
he
was
he
took
her
on
the
Dragons
grim-toothed
roundabout
switchbacks
It
was
not
nearly
so
exciting
as
a
tram-car
actually
But
then
to
be
seated
in
a
shaking
green
dragon
uplifted
above
the
sea
of
bubble
faces
careering
in
a
rickety
fashion
in
the
lower
heavens
whilst
John
Thomas
leaned
over
her
his
cigarette
in
his
mouth
was
after
all
the
right
style
She
was
a
plump
quick
alive
little
creature
So
she
was
quite
excited
and
happy
John
Thomas
made
her
stay
on
for
the
next
round
And
therefore
she
could
hardly
for
shame
repulse
him
when
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
drew
her
a
little
nearer
to
him
in
a
very
warm
and
cuddly
manner
Besides
he
was
fairly
discreet
he
kept
his
movement
as
hidden
as
possible
She
looked
down
and
saw
that
his
red
clean
hand
was
out
of
sight
of
the
crowd
And
they
knew
each
other
so
well
So
they
warmed
up
to
the
fair
After
the
dragons
they
went
on
the
horses
John
Thomas
paid
each
time
so
she
could
but
be
complaisant
He
of
course
sat
astride
on
the
outer
horse
named
Black
Bess
and
she
sat
sideways
towards
him
on
the
inner
horse--named
Wildfire
But
of
course
John
Thomas
was
not
going
to
sit
discreetly
on
Black
Bess
holding
the
brass
bar
Round
they
spun
and
heaved
in
the
light
And
round
he
swung
on
his
wooden
steed
flinging
one
leg
across
her
mount
and
perilously
tipping
up
and
down
across
the
space
half
lying
back
laughing
at
her
He
was
perfectly
happy
she
was
afraid
her
hat
was
on
one
side
but
she
was
excited
He
threw
quoits
on
a
table
and
won
for
her
two
large
pale
blue
hat-pins
And
then
hearing
the
noise
of
the
cinemas
announcing
another
performance
they
climbed
the
boards
and
went
in
Of
course
during
these
performances
pitch
darkness
falls
from
time
to
time
when
the
machine
goes
wrong
Then
there
is
a
wild
whooping
and
a
loud
smacking
of
simulated
kisses
In
these
moments
John
Thomas
drew
Annie
towards
him
After
all
he
had
a
wonderfully
warm
cosy
way
of
holding
a
girl
with
his
arm
he
seemed
to
make
such
a
nice
fit
And
after
all
it
was
pleasant
to
be
so
held
so
very
comforting
and
cosy
and
nice
He
leaned
over
her
and
she
felt
his
breath
on
her
hair
she
knew
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
on
the
lips
And
after
all
he
was
so
warm
and
she
fitted
in
to
him
so
softly
After
all
she
wanted
him
to
touch
her
lips
But
the
light
sprang
up
she
also
started
electrically
and
put
her
hat
straight
He
left
his
arm
lying
nonchalantly
behind
her
Well
it
was
fun
it
was
exciting
to
be
at
the
Statutes
with
John
Thomas
When
the
cinema
was
over
they
went
for
a
walk
across
the
dark
damp
fields
He
had
all
the
arts
of
love-making
He
was
especially
good
at
holding
a
girl
when
he
sat
with
her
on
a
stile
in
the
black
drizzling
darkness
He
seemed
to
be
holding
her
in
space
against
his
own
warmth
and
gratification
And
his
kisses
were
soft
and
slow
and
searching
So
Annie
walked
out
with
John
Thomas
though
she
kept
her
own
boy
dangling
in
the
distance
Some
of
the
tram-girls
chose
to
be
huffy
But
there
you
must
take
things
as
you
find
them
in
this
life
There
was
no
mistake
about
it
Annie
liked
John
Thomas
a
good
deal
She
felt
so
rich
and
warm
in
herself
whenever
he
was
near
And
John
Thomas
really
liked
Annie
more
than
usual
The
soft
melting
way
in
which
she
could
flow
into
a
fellow
as
if
she
melted
into
his
very
bones
was
something
rare
and
good
He
fully
appreciated
this
But
with
a
developing
acquaintance
there
began
a
developing
intimacy
Annie
wanted
to
consider
him
a
person
a
man
she
wanted
to
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
him
and
to
have
an
intelligent
response
She
did
not
want
a
mere
nocturnal
presence
which
was
what
he
was
so
far
And
she
prided
herself
that
he
could
not
leave
her
Here
she
made
a
mistake
John
Thomas
intended
to
remain
a
nocturnal
presence
he
had
no
idea
of
becoming
an
all-round
individual
to
her
When
she
started
to
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
him
and
his
life
and
his
character
he
sheered
off
He
hated
intelligent
interest
And
he
knew
that
the
only
way
to
stop
it
was
to
avoid
it
The
possessive
female
was
aroused
in
Annie
So
he
left
her
It
is
no
use
saying
she
was
not
surprised
She
was
at
first
startled
thrown
out
of
her
count
For
she
had
been
so
very
sure
of
holding
him
For
a
while
she
was
staggered
and
everything
became
uncertain
to
her
Then
she
wept
with
fury
indignation
desolation
and
misery
Then
she
had
a
spasm
of
despair
And
then
when
he
came
still
impudently
on
to
her
car
still
familiar
but
letting
her
see
by
the
movement
of
his
head
that
he
had
gone
away
to
somebody
else
for
the
time
being
and
was
enjoying
pastures
new
then
she
determined
to
have
her
own
back
She
had
a
very
shrewd
idea
what
girls
John
Thomas
had
taken
out
She
went
to
Nora
Purdy
Nora
was
a
tall
rather
pale
but
well-built
girl
with
beautiful
yellow
hair
She
was
rather
secretive
Hey!
said
Annie
accosting
her
then
softly
Who's
John
Thomas
on
with
now
I
don't
know
said
Nora
Why
tha
does
said
Annie
ironically
lapsing
into
dialect
Tha
knows
as
well
as
I
do
Well
I
do
then
said
Nora
It
isn't
me
so
don't
bother
It's
Cissy
Meakin
isn't
it
It
is
for
all
I
know
Hasn't
he
got
a
face
on
him!
said
Annie
I
don't
half
like
his
cheek
I
could
knock
him
off
the
foot-board
when
he
comes
round
at
me
He'll
get
dropped
on
one
of
these
days
said
Nora
Ay
he
will
when
somebody
makes
up
their
mind
to
drop
it
on
him
I
should
like
to
see
him
taken
down
a
peg
or
two
shouldn't
you
I
shouldn't
mind
said
Nora
You've
got
quite
as
much
cause
to
as
I
have
said
Annie
But
we'll
drop
on
him
one
of
these
days
my
girl
What
Don't
you
want
to
I
don't
mind
said
Nora
But
as
a
matter
of
fact
Nora
was
much
more
vindictive
than
Annie

girl

Z
the
observers
What
happened
next
was
June
One
afternoon
when
Emily
had
been
home
with
me
and
Hugo
a
full
day
and
a
night
had
not
gone
at
all
to
the
communal
household
a
little
girl
came
to
the
door
asking
for
her
I
say
a
little
girl
conscious
of
the
absurdity
of
the
phrase
with
its
associations
of
freshness
and
promise
But
after
all
she
was
one
a
very
thin
child
with
strong
prominent
bones
Her
eyes
were
pale
blue
She
had
pale
hair
that
looked
dirty
hanging
to
her
shoulders
and
half-hiding
an
appealing
little
face
She
was
small
for
her
age
could
have
been
eight
or
nine
but
was
in
fact
eleven
In
other
words
she
was
two
years
younger
than
Emily
who
was
a
young
woman
and
loved
precariously
by
the
king
Gerald
But
her
breasts
were
stubby
little
points
and
her
body
altogether
in
the
chrysalis
stage
Where
is
Emily
she
demanded
Her
voice
but
I
shall
only
say
that
it
was
at
the
extreme
away
from
good
English
the
norm
once
used
for
announcements
news
or
by
officialdom
I
could
hardly
understand
her
her
accent
was
so
degraded
I
am
not
talking
about
the
words
she
used
which
were
always
sharp
enough
when
one
had
uncoded
them
were
stubborn
and
strong
attempts
to
lay
hold
of
meanings
and
ideas
every
bit
as
clear
and
good
as
those
expressed
in
tutored
speech
The
peremptoriness
of
the
Where
is
Emily
was
not
from
rudeness
but
because
of
the
effort
she
had
to
put
into
it
the
determination
to
be
understood
and
to
be
led
to
Emily
or
that
Emily
should
be
brought
out
to
her
It
was
too
because
she
was
a
person
who
had
not
been
brought
up
to
believe
she
had
rights
Yet
she
set
herself
towards
goals
she
wanted
things
and
achieved
them
she
would
reach
her
Emily
without
the
help
of
words
skills
manners
without
rights
She's
here
I
said
And
please
come
in
She
followed
me
stiff
with
the
determination
that
had
got
her
here
Her
eyes
were
everywhere
and
the
thought
came
into
my
mind
that
she
was
pricing
what
she
saw
Or
rather
valuing
since
pricing
was
somewhat
out-of-date
When
she
saw
Emily
today
a
languid
suffering
young
woman
on
a
chair
by
the
window
her
two
bare
feet
set
side
by
side
on
her
attendant
yellow
beast
the
child's
face
lit
with
a
heartbreakingly
sweet
smile
all
confidence
and
love
and
she
ran
forward
forgetting
herself
And
Emily
seeing
her
smiled
and
forgot
her
troubles
love-troubles
and
goodness
knows
what
else
and
the
two
girls
went
into
the
tiny
room
that
was
Emily's
Two
girls
in
a
young
girls
friendship
despite
one
being
already
a
woman
and
one
still
a
child
with
a
child's
face
and
body
But
not
as
I
discovered
with
a
child's
imaginings
for
she
was
in
love
with
Gerald
And
after
having
suffered
jealousy
because
of
the
favourite
Emily
by
turns
hating
and
denigrating
her
or
feverishly
and
slavishly
admiring
her
now
she
was
her
sister
in
sorrow
when
Gerald
was
being
loved
served
by
another
girl
or
girls
It
was
morning
when
she
came
and
at
lunchtime
the
two
emerged
from
the
bedroom
and
Emily
asked
with
her
unfailing
visitor's
manners
If
you
don't
mind
I
would
like
to
ask
June
to
have
a
sandwich
or
something
Later
in
the
day
the
two
tired
of
the
stuffy
room
and
came
into
the
living-room
and
sat
on
the
floor
on
either
side
of
Hugo
and
talked
while
they
patted
and
petted
him
June
was
wanting
advice
and
information
on
all
kinds
of
practical
matters
and
particularly
about
the
garden
which
was
Emily's
responsibility
since
Emily
understood
about
all
that
kind
of
thing
She
did
I
knew
nothing
of
this
in
Emily
who
with
me
had
not
showed
the
slightest
interest
in
such
matters
not
even
in
the
potted
plants
I
sat
listening
to
their
talk
reconstructing
from
it
the
life
of
their
community
how
very
odd
it
was
that
all
over
our
cities
side
by
side
with
citizens
who
still
used
electric
light
drew
water
for
which
they
had
paid
from
taps
expected
their
rubbish
to
be
collected
were
these
houses
which
were
as
if
the
technological
revolution
had
never
occurred
at
all
The
big
house
fifteen
minutes
walk
away
had
been
an
old
people's
home
It
had
large
grounds
Shrubs
and
flowerbeds
had
been
cleared
and
now
there
were
only
vegetables
There
was
even
a
little
shed
in
which
a
few
fowls
were
kept
another
illegality
that
went
on
everywhere
and
to
which
the
authorities
turned
a
blind
eye
The
household
bought
or
acquired
in
some
way
flour
dried
legumes
honey
But
they
were
about
to
get
a
hive
of
bees
They
also
bought
the
substitutes
chicken
and
beef
and
lamb
and
concocted
the
usual
unappetising
meals
with
them
Unappetising
only
to
some
there
were
plenty
of
young
people
who
had
eaten
nothing
else
in
their
lives
and
who
now
preferred
the
substitute
to
the
real
thing
As
I've
said
we
learn
to
like
what
we
can
get
The
place
was
a
conglomeration
of
little
workshops
they
made
soap
and
candles
and
wove
materials
and
dyed
them
they
cured
leather
they
dried
and
preserved
food
they
reconstructed
and
made
furniture
And
so
they
all
lived
Gerald's
gang
thirty
of
them
now
with
pressure
always
on
them
to
expand
since
so
many
people
wanted
to
join
them
and
had
to
be
refused
there
was
no
space
It
was
not
that
I
was
surprised
to
learn
of
all
this
I
had
heard
it
all
before
in
various
forms
For
instance
there
had
been
a
community
of
young
adults
and
small
children
not
far
away
where
even
the
water
system
and
sewage
had
broken
down
They
had
made
a
privy
in
the
garden
a
pit
with
a
packing-case
over
it
and
a
can
of
ashes
for
the
smell
and
the
flies
They
bought
water
from
the
door
or
tapped
the
mains
as
they
could
and
cadged
baths
from
friends
there
was
a
time
when
my
bathroom
was
being
used
by
them
But
that
group
drifted
off
somewhere
All
over
our
city
were
these
pockets
of
life
reverting
to
the
primitive
the
hand-to-mouth
Part
of
a
house
then
the
whole
house
a
group
of
houses
a
street
an
area
of
streets
People
looking
down
from
a
high
building
saw
how
these
nuclei
of
barbarism
took
hold
and
spread
At
first
the
observers
were
all
sharp
hostility
and
fear
They
made
the
sounds
of
disapproval
of
rectitude
but
they
were
in
fact
learning
as
they
the
still
fortunate
watched
these
savages
from
whose
every
finger
sprouted
new
skills
and
talents
In
some
parts
of
the
city
whole
suburbs
had
reverted
Miles
of
people
all
growing
their
potatoes
and
onions
and
carrots
and
cabbages
and
setting
guard
on
them
day
and
night
raising
chickens
and
ducks
making
their
sewage
into
compost
buying
or
selling
water
using
empty
rooms
or
an
empty
house
to
breed
rabbits
or
even
a
pig
people
no
longer
in
neat
little
families
but
huddled
together
in
groups
and
clans
whose
structure
evolved
under
the
pressures
of
necessity
At
night
such
an
area
withdrew
itself
into
a
dangerous
obscurity
where
no
one
dared
go
with
its
sparce
or
absent
street
lighting
its
potholed
pavements
and
rutted
streets
the
windows
showing
the
minuscule
flickering
of
candles
or
the
shallow
glow
of
some
improvised
light
on
a
wall
or
a
ceiling
Even
in
the
daytime
to
walk
there
seeing
wary
faces
half-visible
behind
shutters
knowing
that
bows
and
arrows
catapults
or
even
guns
were
held
trained
for
use
if
you
transgressed
such
an
expedition
was
like
a
foray
into
enemy
territory
or
into
the
past
of
the
human
race
Yet
even
at
that
late
stage
there
was
a
level
of
our
society
which
managed
to
live
as
if
nothing
much
was
happening
nothing
irreparable
The
ruling
class
but
that
was
a
dead
phrase
so
they
said
very
well
then
the
kind
of
person
who
ran
things
administered
sat
on
councils
and
committees
made
decisions
Talked
The
bureaucracy
An
international
bureaucracy
But
when
has
it
not
been
true
that
the
section
of
a
society
which
gets
the
most
out
of
it
maintains
in
itself
and
for
as
long
as
it
can
in
others
an
illusion
of
security
permanence
order
It
seems
to
me
that
this
has
something
to
do
at
bottom
with
conscience
a
vestigial
organ
in
humanity
which
still
demands
that
there
should
be
some
sort
of
justice
or
equity
feels
that
it
is
intolerable
this
is
felt
by
most
people
somewhere
or
at
least
occasionally
that
some
people
do
well
while
others
starve
and
fail
This
is
the
most
powerful
of
mechanisms
for
to
begin
with
the
maintaining
of
a
society
and
then
its
undermining
its
rotting
its
collapse
yes
of
course
this
is
not
new
has
been
going
on
throughout
history
very
likely
and
as
far
as
we
know
Has
there
been
a
time
in
our
country
when
the
ruling
class
was
not
living
inside
its
glass
bell
of
respectability
or
of
wealth
shutting
its
eyes
to
what
went
on
outside
Could
there
be
any
real
difference
when
this
ruling
class
used
words
like
justice
fair
play
equity
order
or
even
socialism
used
them
might
even
have
believed
in
them
or
believed
in
them
for
a
time
but
meanwhile
everything
fell
to
pieces
while
still
as
always
the
administrators
lived
cushioned
against
the
worst
trying
to
talk
away
wish
away
legislate
away
the
worst
for
to
admit
that
it
was
happening
was
to
admit
themselves
useless
admit
the
extra
security
they
enjoyed
was
theft
and
not
payment
for
services
rendered
And
yet
in
a
way
everybody
played
a
part
in
this
conspiracy
that
nothing
much
was
happening
or
that
it
was
happening
but
one
day
things
would
go
into
reverse
and
hey
presto!
back
we
would
be
in
the
good
old
days
Which
though
That
was
a
matter
of
temperament
if
you
have
nothing
you
are
free
to
choose
among
dreams
and
fantasies
I
fancied
a
rather
elegant
sort
of
feudalism
without
wars
of
course
or
injustice
Emily
having
never
experienced
or
suffered
it
would

O
one
of
young
couple
riding
P
other
of
young
couple
riding
It
was
a
warm
still
sunless
day
in
mid-August
The
sky
did
not
appear
so
much
cloudy
as
merely
a
uniform
pearly
gray
like
the
inside
of
a
seashell
Primrose
said
The
sea
where
they
saw
it
through
the
motionless
drooping
trees
was
gray
too
the
bay
looking
like
a
polished
metal
mirror
in
which
the
reflections
of
the
lead-gray
mountains
were
clear
and
motionless
In
the
forest
it
was
very
quiet
as
though
all
the
birds
and
small
creatures
had
abandoned
it
and
the
two
figures
of
the
man
and
his
wife
walking
along
the
narrow
footpath
and
their
little
cat
bounding
along
beside
them
seemed
the
only
things
alive
so
that
when
a
vermilion
and
black
and
white
garter
snake
wriggled
off
into
the
dry
leaves
and
twigs
it
sounded
loud
as
a
deer
crashing
through
the
bracken
Primrose
was
looking
everywhere
for
the
pair
of
goldfinches
whose
nest
with
its
exquisite
pale
blue-white
eggs
they
had
found
in
a
trammon
tree
only
six
feet
from
the
ground
in
May
and
which
they
had
watched
all
summer
with
delight
but
their
birds
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
The
dear
goldfinches
have
gone
to
Alcapancingo
she
said
Not
so
early
They're
just
gone
because
they
don't
like
it
here
any
more
with
all
these
new
houses
going
up
and
their
old
haunts
destroyed
Don't
be
gloomy
Sig
darling
It'll
be
all
right
Primrose
and
Sigbjrn
Wilderness
were
now
approaching
the
few
houses
on
the
fringe
of
the
forest
The
cat
black
and
white
with
platinum
whiskers
sat
sniffing
at
a
clump
of
spring
beauty
He
would
go
no
further
Then
he
vanished
Sigbjrn
and
Primrose
came
out
of
the
woods
into
a
place
where
the
ground
was
being
cleared
then
as
by
common
consent
turned
off
before
they
reached
the
store
that
had
come
in
sight
which
was
being
partly
dismantled
in
order
to
create
a
larger
one
taking
another
side
path
to
the
left
This
transverse
path
had
also
once
led
through
the
woods
but
the
ground
on
one
side
had
been
cleared
for
building
The
bushes
had
been
allowed
to
remain
and
it
was
still
a
pleasant
leafy
way
of
thimbleberries
and
salmonberries
that
in
winter
in
frost
in
moonlight
made
a
trillion
moons
It
brought
them
out
abruptly
on
a
dusty
main
highway
upon
either
side
of
which
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
lay
sections
of
brown
drainpipe
and
where
a
signpost
said
To
Dark
Rosslyn
Sigbjrn's
emotions
now
were
entirely
those
of
the
cat's
or
what
the
cat's
would
have
been
had
he
had
the
poor
sense
to
accompany
them
this
far
terror
fear
distrust
anger
anguish
and
a
hatred
so
pure
in
its
intensity
it
was
almost
beautiful
to
experience
It
was
mid-afternoon
and
Sunday
and
now
the
cars
honked
and
whizzed
by
in
an
all
but
continuous
uproar
each
sending
up
its
private
cyclone
of
dust
from
the
road
against
which
the
two
had
constantly
to
pause
and
turn
their
backs
The
bus
for
Dark
Rosslyn
came
past
snarling
like
a
wild
beast
crashed
by
leaving
a
backwash
of
air
in
which
the
trees
thrashed
for
some
moments
For
there
were
trees
again
now
on
either
side
of
the
road
for
a
short
distance
then
where
there
had
been
the
woodland
through
which
they
would
have
continued
their
path
there
was
a
huge
area
of
rubble
from
which
stumps
of
trees
blackened
hollow
some
in
cactus
shapes
protruded
as
if
blasted
by
lightning
Near
at
hand
on
the
highway
with
no
thought
of
privacy
some
new
houses
had
already
been
built
but
owing
to
the
law
no
trees
were
left
near
them
Nevertheless
the
destruction
of
the
forest
had
opened
up
a
magnificent
view
of
the
mountains
and
the
inlet
that
had
been
invisible
from
the
road
before
and
you
would
have
thought
that
all
this
evidence
of
growth
and
rebuilding
would
have
been
productive
of
anything
but
despair
On
either
side
of
the
road
a
shallow
ditch
fell
away
to
what
in
other
seasons
was
a
small
brook
now
dry
and
choked
with
weeds
Primrose
searching
for
wildflowers
wherever
a
trace
of
moisture
remained
in
these
ditches
was
wandering
back
and
forth
across
the
road
or
even
pausing
vaguely
in
the
middle
to
search
the
banks
on
either
side
At
these
times
Sigbjrn
would
shout
at
her
or
even
seize
her
by
the
waist
or
shoulder
and
push
her
into
the
side
Look
out
My
God
there's
a
car
Primrose
There's
a
I
know
it
Look
darling
and
she
was
off
again
swift
and
graceful
in
her
scarlet
corduroy
slacks
Sigbjrn's
anxiety
shifted
now
as
for
the
moment
she
walked
in
single
file
ahead
of
him
though
every
time
a
car
went
by
he
almost
jumped
into
the
ditch
himself
to
their
goal
in
Dark
Rosslyn
He
doubted
his
ability
to
find
it
in
the
maze
of
roads
that
wandered
around
the
hillside
at
the
edge
of
the
town
wondered
if
he
would
recognize
the
house
again
through
the
heavy
dolorous
recollections
of
the
previous
Sunday
and
feeling
in
his
right
side
still
the
pain
of
the
fall
in
the
black
woods
he
began
to
sweat
Now
he
wished
to
take
off
his
shirt
knowing
that
if
he
said
so
Primrose
would
say
brightly
Well
why
don't
you
and
somehow
unable
to
do
so
on
this
main
highway

said
a

Soft

Private
and
now
the
road
was
half
torn
up
and
the
ditches
where
the
brook
had
been
and
the
wildflowers
of
spring
once
grew
were
being
filled
in
with
a
pipe
line
bringing
water
and
all
the
commercial
comforts
and
plumbing
of
civilization
to
their
once
wild
and
lonely
haven
Here
in
a
particularly
vicious
slash
where
some
rank
thistles
and
huge
dandelions
grew
they
saw
their
goldfinches
feeding
among
the
thistles
and
paused
Among
them
was
a
new
bird
like
a
tiny
yellow
and
black
striped
sparrow
and
Primrose
ran
across
the
road
again
followed
by
Sigbjrn
looking
both
ways
at
once
Look!
It's
a
pine
martin
A
martin's
a
kind
of
rat
Yes
that's
right
but
there's
a
bird
called
a
purple
martin
You
mean
a
pine
siskin
Of
course
But
what's
it
doing
here
on
the
coast
They
only
live
in
the
high
altitudes
Oh
isn't
it
sweet
The
pine
siskin
darted
away
and
they
walked
on
past
now
thank
God
the
end
of
ugsome
Rosslyn
Park
and
the
little
new
coffee
bar
Sigbjrn
glanced
at
it
with
pure
hatred
it
was
Sunday
but
anyhow
you
could
only
buy
Coca-Cola
and
Seven-Up
the
big
new
schoolhouse
a
great
concrete
block
of
mnemonic
anguish
and
reached
a
short
stretch
still
comparatively
unspoiled
What
did
he
mean
by
this
comparatively
unspoiled
Were
one's
emotions
of
horror
even
quite
the
truth
Canada
was
indeed
a
pretty
large
country
to
despoil
But
her
legends
nearly
all
her
most
valuable
and
heroic
history
was
the
history
of
spoliation
in
one
form
or
another
But
man
was
not
a
bird
or
a
wild
animal
however
much
he
might
live
in
the
wilderness
The
conquering
of
wilderness
whether
in
fact
or
in
his
mind
was
part
of
his
own
process
of
self-determination
The
plight
was
an
old-fashioned
one
that
had
become
true
again
progress
was
the
enemy
it
was
not
making
man
more
happy
or
secure
Ruination
and
vulgarization
had
become
a
habit
Nor
though
they
had
found
a
sort
of
peace
a
sort
of
heaven
and
were
now
losing
it
again
had
they
very
consciously
been
looking
for
peace
Nevertheless
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
green
loveliness
of
their
lost
woodland
etc
etc
and
all
these
conflicting
clichs
buzzed
in
his
head
as
he
followed
Primrose
who
had
found
a
deep
spot
where
a
pool
of
water
from
the
brook
still
lingered
and
here
shaded
from
the
dust
and
heat
of
summer
a
mass
of
wild
blue
forget-me-nots
shone
fresh
and
bright
among
damp
emerald
moss
and
near
it
some
American
brooklime
But
Sigbjrn
could
not
climb
down
and
pick
them
for
her
he
could
not
even
remember
the
name
though
he
himself
had
first
found
and
identified
this
latter
flower
in
June
She
didn't
want
them
now
Primrose
said
they
would
be
all
wilted
before
they
even
reached
Dark
Rosslyn
perhaps
he
could
pick
her
some
on
the
way
back
And
now
she
had
seen
some
goldenrod
growing
among
a
great
bank
of
pearly
everlasting
the
first
goldenrod
of
the
year
They
would
pick
that
on
their
way
back
too
I'm
even
more
doubtful
now
he
said
Of
what
That
I
can
find
the
house
But
I
phoned
the
taxi
driver
this
morning
You
told
me
to
I
said
we'd
be
along
this
afternoon
He
knows
where
it
is
doesn't
he
I
don't
think
I
can
face
him
With
his
knowing
grin
he
added
There's
the
taxi
driver's
house
just
ahead
honey
Come
on
it'll
soon
be
over
now
Besides
I
wanted
to
save
money
Sigbjrn
said
Save!
Don't
be
angry
I'm
sure
I
can
find
it
Sigbjrn
said
standing
at
the
crossroads
It's
just
up
there
and
off
to
the
left
I
think
Well
how
far
is
it
Primrose
said
dubiously
Not
too
far
Well
perhaps
it's
a
fair
distance
but
if
we
don't
find
it
we
can
always
come
back
and
get
the
taxi
Primrose
hesitated
then
took
his
arm
and
they
went
off
up
the
side
road
The
road
was
unpaved
and
dusty
but
at
least
they
were
rid
of
the
momentous
traffic
and
the
taxi
driver
and
Sigbjrn
felt
rather
less
sick
and
almost
hopeful
But
the
intrusion
of
the
taxi
driver
at
all
disturbed
and
confused
him
Why
had
he
told
Primrose
to
phone
the
taxi
driver
He
thought
he
remembered
him
in
relation
to
last
Sunday
but
the
connection
between
him
and
the
object
of
their
visit
was
vague
Nonetheless
he
had
been
sufficiently
conscious
of
such
a
connection
to
think
it
worth
getting
Primrose
to
phone
And
then
there
was
always
the
question
that
he'd
thought
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
make
it
walking
at
all
The
road
went
downhill
briefly
toward
the
sea
turned
sharply
right
then
left
again
and
now
ahead
of
them
was
a
long
steep
hill
He
gazed
at
it
in
dismay
for
it
didn't
look
familiar
at
all
Had
he
really
come
this
way
Or
should
he
have
made
that
other
turn
off
to
the
left
as
Primrose
suggested
was
more
likely
He
hesitated
listening
to
the
distant
sound
of
traffic
the
klaxons
sounded
like
blended
mouthorgans
No
I'm
sure
it's
this
way
Come
on
Sigbjrn
said
and
they
started
up
the
hill
doggedly
Now
the
traffic
behind
a
suburban
dementia
launched
itself
at
them
flat
ugly
houses
the
cleared
land
stricken
and
bare
left
without
a
tree
to
give
shade
or
privacy
or
beauty
or
strewn
with
half
burned
stumps
and
rubbish

But
behind
each
one
of
these
bourgeois
horrors
was
still
the
dark
forest
waiting
one
hoped
for
revenge
They
trudged
slowly
up
the
hill
and
now
Sigbjrn
really
began
to
sweat
for
it
was
hot
here
with
a
sultry
damp
heat
that
made
the
air
feel
thick
and
hard
to
breathe
and
his
side
was
hurting
again
He
looked
anxiously
back
at
Primrose
who
had
removed
her
scarlet
corduroy
jacket
and
was
panting
and
scowling
behind
him
for
though
she
loved
to
walk
she
hated
climbing
hills
and
at
this
moment
she
meant
him
to
know
it
Sigbjrn
went
ahead
but
he
could
already
see
that
it
was
as
she
said
the
road
wound
directly
away
from
Dark
Rosslyn
and
back
toward
home
But
there
too
just
at
the
turn
was
a
rustic
wood
arch
at
the
left
which
said
Whytecliffe
Resort
Riding
Academy
Horses
by
the
Day
or
Hour
Refreshments
Sigbjrn
waited
unhappily
until
Primrose
caught
up
with
him
Well
she
said
Did
you
go
to
Whytecliffe
I
don't
think
so
No
Surely
you'd
remember
that
thing
She
pointed
to
the
arch
I
don't
know
but
we
might
as
well
go
and
see
You
go
then
I'll
sit
here
and
catch
my
breath
Tall
cedars
Douglas
firs
grew
beyond
the
arch
as
he
went
up
the
bridle
path
and
it
was
a
little
cooler
a
breath
from
the
sea
below
freshened
the
air
and
now
he
could
see
the
bay
beneath
him
and
for
some
reason
this
made
him
feel
better
There
below
him
and
to
the
right
were
the
stables
people
were
getting
on
and
off
horses
calling
to
each
other
and
a
young
couple
mounted
and
paced
up
the
hill
toward
him
What
do
I
do
You
just
pull
on
the
right
rein
and
it'll
do
it
for
you
And
that
was
true
too
once
on
it
the
horse
would
do
everything
for
you
even
to
throwing
you
off
It
was
hard
to
be
angry
with
a
place
where
you
could
hire
horses
or
see
a
riding
academy
as
a
symptom
of
modernity
He
and
Primrose
always
talked
of
riding
together
though
they
never
had
And
how
much
better
the
money
might
have
been
spent
here
with
her
well
it
was
no
use
looking
he
knew
it
wasn't
here
he'd
been
the
previous
Sunday
and
he
turned
back
Isn't
this
where
Greenslade
lives
now
at
Whytecliffe
somewhere
she
said
when
he
returned
to
the
arch
I
think
so
Yes
We
might
go
and
find
him
then
He'll
know
where
it
is
No!
Sigbjrn
said
No
I'll
find
it
for
Christ's
sake
or
we'll
get
the
taxi
driver
Come
on
But
Greenslade
was
with
you
He'll
know
No
Sigbjrn
started
distractedly
down
the
hill
You
said
no
yourself
You
said
you'd
rather
be
in
hell
than
meet
Greenslade
again
He's
a
horrible
man
Yapping
about
the
benefits
of
civilization
How
easy
it
is
for
people
to
talk
about
the
benefits
of
civilization
who've
never
known
the
far
greater
benefits
of
not
having
anything
to
do
with
it
at
all
Halfway
down
the
hill
Primrose
suddenly
took
his
arm
Look
Sigbjrn
there
those
birds
with
the
white
stripes
on
their
tails
Vesper
sparrows
No
They
don't
have
so
much
white
Oh
what
are
they
Pipits
Some
kind
of
pipits
American
pipits
Sigbjrn
said
as
the
birds
lighted
on
a
nearby
alder
tree
Yeah
See
how
they're
bobbing
their
tails
How
clever
you
are
Primrose
held
his
arm
tightly
to
her
side
And
brave
too
I
think
you're
swell
I
know
this
is
perfectly
bloody
for
you
Thank
you
I
think
you're
very
fine
too
But
all
this
isn't
easy
to
do
And
I
don't
see
why
I'm
doing
it
But
you
said
you
wanted
to
make
a
new
start
you
said
it
was
to
be
Yes
it
was
It

OF

A
THRONGING
VITALITY
WHICH
EXCITES
THE

AND
PREPARES
THE

FOR
THE
UNEXPECTED
DO
YOU
KNOW
PARIS
WELL
I
ASKED
NO
WE
CAME
ON
OUR
HONEYMOON
I
HAVEN'T
BEEN
SINCE
HOW
ON
EARTH
DID
YOU
FIND
OUT
YOUR
HOTEL
IT
WAS
RECOMMENDED
TO
ME
I
WANTED
SOMETHING
CHEAP
THE
ABSINTHE
CAME
AND
WITH
DUE
SOLEMNITY
WE
DROPPED
WATER
OVER
THE
MELTING
SUGAR
I
THOUGHT
I'D
BETTER
TELL
YOU
AT
ONCE
WHY
I
HAD
COME
TO
SEE
YOU
I
SAID
NOT
WITHOUT
EMBARRASSMENT
HIS
EYES
TWINKLED
I
THOUGHT
SOMEBODY
WOULD
COME
ALONG
SOONER
OR
LATER
I'VE
HAD
A

OF
LETTERS
FROM
AMY
THEN
YOU
KNOW
PRETTY
WELL
WHAT
I'VE
GOT
TO
SAY
I'VE
NOT
READ
THEM
I
LIT
A
CIGARETTE
TO
GIVE
MYSELF
A
MOMENT'S
TIME
I
DID
NOT
QUITE
KNOW
HOW
TO
SET
ABOUT
MY
MISSION

ELOQUENT
PHRASES
I
HAD
ARRANGED
PATHETIC

SEEMED
OUT

PLACE
ON
THE
AVENUE
DE
CLICHY
SUDDENLY
HE
GAVE
A
CHUCKLE
BEASTLY
JOB
FOR
YOU
THIS
ISN'T
IT
OH
I
DON'T
KNOW
I
ANSWERED
WELL
LOOK
HERE
YOU
GET
IT
OVER
AND
THEN
WE'LL
HAVE
A
JOLLY
EVENING
I
HESITATED
HAS
IT
OCCURRED
TO
YOU
THAT
YOUR
WIFE
IS
FRIGHTFULLY
UNHAPPY
SHE'LL
GET
OVER
IT
I
CANNOT
DESCRIBE
THE
EXTRAORDINARY
CALLOUSNESS
WITH
WHICH
HE
MADE
THIS
REPLY
IT
DISCONCERTED
ME
BUT
I
DID
MY
BEST
NOT
TO
SHOW
IT
I
ADOPTED
THE
TONE
USED
BY
MY
UNCLE
HENRY
A
CLERGYMAN
WHEN
HE
WAS
ASKING
ONE
OF
HIS
RELATIVES
FOR
A
SUBSCRIPTION
TO
THE
ADDITIONAL
CURATES
SOCIETY
YOU
DON'T
MIND
MY
TALKING
TO
YOU
FRANKLY
HE
SHOOK
HIS
HEAD
SMILING
HAS
SHE
DESERVED
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
TREAT
HER
LIKE
THIS
NO
HAVE
YOU
ANY
COMPLAINT
TO
MAKE
AGAINST
HER
NONE
THEN
ISN'T
IT
MONSTROUS
TO
LEAVE
HER
IN
THIS
FASHION
AFTER
SEVENTEEN
YEARS
OF
MARRIED
LIFE
WITHOUT
A
FAULT
TO
FIND
WITH
HER
MONSTROUS
I
GLANCED
AT
HIM
WITH
SURPRISE
HIS
CORDIAL
AGREEMENT
WITH
ALL
I
SAID
CUT
THE
GROUND
FROM
UNDER
MY
FEET
IT
MADE
MY
POSITION
COMPLICATED
NOT
TO
SAY
LUDICROUS
I
WAS
PREPARED
TO
BE
PERSUASIVE
TOUCHING
AND
HORTATORY
ADMONITORY
AND
EXPOSTULATING
IF
NEED
BE
VITUPERATIVE
EVEN
INDIGNANT
AND
SARCASTIC
BUT
WHAT
THE
DEVIL
DOES
A
MENTOR
DO
WHEN
THE
SINNER
MAKES
NO
BONES
ABOUT
CONFESSING
HIS
SIN
I
HAD
NO
EXPERIENCE
SINCE
MY
OWN
PRACTICE
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
TO
DENY
EVERYTHING
WHAT
THEN
ASKED
STRICKLAND
I
TRIED
TO
CURL
MY
LIP
WELL
IF
YOU
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
THERE
DOESN'T
SEEM
MUCH
MORE
TO
BE
SAID
I
DON'T
THINK
THERE
IS
I
FELT
THAT
I
WAS
NOT
CARRYING
OUT
MY
EMBASSY
WITH
ANY
GREAT
SKILL
I
WAS
DISTINCTLY
NETTLED
HANG
IT
ALL
ONE
CAN'T
LEAVE
A
WOMAN
WITHOUT
A
BOB
WHY
NOT
HOW
IS
SHE
GOING
TO
LIVE
I'VE
SUPPORTED
HER
FOR
SEVENTEEN
YEARS
WHY
SHOULDN'T
SHE
SUPPORT
HERSELF
FOR
A
CHANGE
SHE
CAN'T
LET
HER
TRY
OF
COURSE
THERE
WERE
MANY
THINGS
I
MIGHT
HAVE
ANSWERED
TO
THIS
I
MIGHT
HAVE
SPOKEN
OF
THE
ECONOMIC
POSITION
OF
WOMAN
OF
THE
CONTRACT
TACIT
AND
OVERT
WHICH
A
MAN
ACCEPTS
BY
HIS
MARRIAGE
AND
OF
MUCH
ELSE
BUT
I
FELT
THAT
THERE
WAS
ONLY
ONE
POINT
WHICH
REALLY
SIGNIFIED
DON'T
YOU
CARE
FOR
HER
ANY
MORE
NOT
A
BIT
HE
REPLIED
THE
MATTER
WAS
IMMENSELY
SERIOUS
FOR
ALL
THE
PARTIES
CONCERNED
BUT
THERE
WAS
IN
THE
MANNER
OF
HIS
ANSWERS
SUCH
A
CHEERFUL
EFFRONTERY
THAT
I
HAD
TO
BITE
MY
LIPS
IN
ORDER
NOT
TO
LAUGH
I
REMINDED
MYSELF
THAT
HIS
BEHAVIOUR
WAS
ABOMINABLE
I
WORKED
MYSELF
UP
INTO
A
STATE
OF
MORAL
INDIGNATION
DAMN
IT
ALL
THERE
ARE
YOUR
CHILDREN
TO
THINK
OF
THEY'VE
NEVER
DONE
YOU
ANY
HARM
THEY
DIDN'T
ASK
TO
BE
BROUGHT
INTO
THE
WORLD
IF
YOU
CHUCK
EVERYTHING
LIKE
THIS
THEY'LL
BE
THROWN
ON
THE
STREETS
THEY'VE
HAD
A
GOOD
MANY
YEARS
OF
COMFORT
IT'S
MUCH
MORE
THAN
THE
MAJORITY
OF
CHILDREN
HAVE
BESIDES
SOMEBODY
WILL
LOOK
AFTER
THEM
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
THE
POINT
THE
MACANDREWS
WILL
PAY
FOR
THEIR
SCHOOLING
BUT
AREN'T
YOU
FOND
OF
THEM
THEY'RE
SUCH
AWFULLY
NICE
KIDS
DO
YOU
MEAN
TO
SAY
YOU
DON'T
WANT
TO
HAVE
ANYTHING
MORE
TO
DO
WITH
THEM
I
LIKED
THEM
ALL
RIGHT
WHEN
THEY
WERE
KIDS
BUT
NOW
THEY'RE
GROWING
UP
I
HAVEN'T
GOT
ANY
PARTICULAR
FEELING
FOR
THEM
IT'S
JUST
INHUMAN
I
DARE
SAY
YOU
DON'T
SEEM
IN
THE
LEAST
ASHAMED
I'M
NOT
I
TRIED
ANOTHER
TACK
EVERYONE
WILL
THINK
YOU
A
PERFECT
SWINE
LET
THEM
WON'T
IT
MEAN
ANYTHING
TO
YOU
TO
KNOW
THAT
PEOPLE
LOATHE
AND
DESPISE
YOU
NO
HIS
BRIEF
ANSWER
WAS
SO
SCORNFUL
THAT
IT
MADE
MY
QUESTION
NATURAL
THOUGH
IT
WAS
SEEM
ABSURD
I
REFLECTED
FOR
A
MINUTE
OR
TWO
I
WONDER
IF
ONE
CAN
LIVE
QUITE
COMFORTABLY
WHEN
ONE'S
CONSCIOUS
OF
THE
DISAPPROVAL
OF
ONE'S
FELLOWS
ARE
YOU
SURE
IT
WON'T
BEGIN
TO
WORRY
YOU
EVERYONE
HAS
SOME
SORT
OF
CONSCIENCE
AND
SOONER
OR
LATER
IT
WILL
FIND
YOU
OUT
SUPPOSING
YOUR
WIFE
DIED
WOULDN'T
YOU
BE
TORTURED
BY
REMORSE
HE
DID
NOT
ANSWER
AND
I
WAITED
FOR
SOME
TIME
FOR
HIM
TO
SPEAK
AT
LAST
I
HAD
TO
BREAK
THE
SILENCE
MYSELF
WHAT
HAVE
YOU
TO
SAY
OF
THAT
ONLY
THAT
YOU'RE
A
DAMNED
FOOL
AT
ALL
EVENTS
YOU
CAN
BE
FORCED
TO
SUPPORT
YOUR
WIFE
AND
CHILDREN
I
RETORTED
SOMEWHAT
PIQUED
I
SUPPOSE
THE
LAW
HAS
SOME
PROTECTION
TO
OFFER
THEM
CAN
THE
LAW
GET
BLOOD
OUT
OF
A
STONE
I
HAVEN'T
ANY
MONEY
I'VE
GOT
ABOUT
A
HUNDRED
POUNDS
I
BEGAN
TO
BE
MORE
PUZZLED
THAN
BEFORE
IT
WAS
TRUE
THAT
HIS
HOTEL
POINTED
TO
THE
MOST
STRAITENED
CIRCUMSTANCES
WHAT
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
DO
WHEN
YOU'VE
SPENT
THAT
EARN
SOME
HE
WAS
PERFECTLY
COOL
AND
HIS
EYES
KEPT
THAT
MOCKING
SMILE
WHICH
MADE
ALL
I
SAID
SEEM
RATHER
FOOLISH
I
PAUSED
FOR
A
LITTLE
WHILE
TO
CONSIDER
WHAT
I
HAD
BETTER
SAY
NEXT
BUT
IT
WAS
HE
WHO
SPOKE
FIRST
WHY
DOESN'T
AMY
MARRY
AGAIN
SHE'S
COMPARATIVELY
YOUNG
AND
SHE'S
NOT
UNATTRACTIVE
I
CAN
RECOMMEND
HER
AS
AN
EXCELLENT
WIFE
IF
SHE
WANTS
TO
DIVORCE
ME
I
DON'T
MIND
GIVING
HER
THE
NECESSARY
GROUNDS
NOW
IT
WAS
MY
TURN
TO
SMILE
HE
WAS
VERY
CUNNING
BUT
IT
WAS
EVIDENTLY
THIS
THAT
HE
WAS
AIMING
AT
HE
HAD
SOME
REASON
TO
CONCEAL
THE
FACT
THAT
HE
HAD
RUN
AWAY
WITH
A
WOMAN
AND
HE
WAS
USING
EVERY
PRECAUTION
TO
HIDE
HER
WHEREABOUTS
I
ANSWERED
WITH
DECISION
YOUR
WIFE
SAYS
THAT
NOTHING
YOU
CAN
DO
WILL
EVER
INDUCE
HER
TO
DIVORCE
YOU
SHE'S
QUITE
MADE
UP
HER
MIND
YOU
CAN
PUT
ANY
POSSIBILITY
OF
THAT
DEFINITELY
OUT
OF
YOUR
HEAD
HE
LOOKED
AT
ME
WITH
AN
ASTONISHMENT
THAT
WAS
CERTAINLY
NOT
FEIGNED
THE
SMILE
ABANDONED
HIS
LIPS
AND
HE
SPOKE
QUITE
SERIOUSLY
BUT
MY
DEAR
FELLOW
I
DON'T
CARE
IT
DOESN'T
MATTER
A
TWOPENNY
DAMN
TO
ME
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
I
LAUGHED
OH
COME
NOW
YOU
MUSTN'T
THINK
US
SUCH
FOOLS
AS
ALL
THAT
WE
HAPPEN
TO
KNOW
THAT
YOU
CAME
AWAY
WITH
A
WOMAN
HE
GAVE
A
LITTLE
START
AND
THEN
SUDDENLY
BURST
INTO
A
SHOUT
OF
LAUGHTER
HE
LAUGHED
SO
UPROARIOUSLY
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
SITTING
NEAR
US
LOOKED
ROUND
AND
SOME
OF
THEM
BEGAN
TO
LAUGH
TOO
I
DON'T
SEE
ANYTHING
VERY
AMUSING
IN
THAT
POOR
AMY
HE
GRINNED
THEN
HIS
FACE
GREW
BITTERLY
SCORNFUL
WHAT
POOR
MINDS
WOMEN
HAVE
GOT!
LOVE
IT'S
ALWAYS
LOVE
THEY
THINK
A
MAN
LEAVES
THEM
ONLY
BECAUSE
HE
WANTS
OTHERS
DO
YOU
THINK
I
SHOULD
BE
SUCH
A
FOOL
AS
TO
DO
WHAT
I'VE
DONE
FOR
A
WOMAN
DO
YOU
MEAN
TO
SAY
YOU
DIDN'T
LEAVE
YOUR
WIFE
FOR
ANOTHER
WOMAN
OF
COURSE
NOT
ON
YOUR
WORD
OF
HONOUR
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHY
I
ASKED
FOR
THAT
IT
WAS
VERY
INGENUOUS
OF
ME
ON
MY
WORD
OF
HONOUR
THEN
WHAT
IN
GOD'S
NAME
HAVE
YOU
LEFT
HER
FOR
I
WANT
TO
PAINT
I
LOOKED
AT
HIM
FOR
QUITE
A
LONG
TIME
I
DID
NOT
UNDERSTAND
I
THOUGHT
HE
WAS
MAD
IT
MUST
BE
REMEMBERED
THAT
I
WAS
VERY
YOUNG
AND
I
LOOKED
UPON
HIM
AS
A
MIDDLE-AGED
MAN
I
FORGOT
EVERYTHING
BUT
MY
OWN
AMAZEMENT
BUT
YOU'RE
FORTY
THAT'S
WHAT
MADE
ME
THINK
IT
WAS
HIGH
TIME
TO
BEGIN
HAVE
YOU
EVER
PAINTED
I
RATHER
WANTED
TO
BE
A
PAINTER
WHEN
I
WAS
A
BOY
BUT
MY
FATHER
MADE
ME
GO
INTO
BUSINESS
BECAUSE
HE
SAID
THERE
WAS
NO
MONEY
IN
ART
I
BEGAN
TO
PAINT
A
BIT
A
YEAR
AGO
FOR
THE
LAST
YEAR
I'VE
BEEN
GOING
TO
SOME
CLASSES
AT
NIGHT
WAS
THAT
WHERE
YOU
WENT
WHEN
MRS
STRICKLAND
THOUGHT
YOU
WERE
PLAYING
BRIDGE
AT
YOUR
CLUB
THAT'S
IT
WHY
DIDN'T
YOU
TELL
HER
I
PREFERRED
TO
KEEP
IT
TO
MYSELF
CAN
YOU
PAINT
NOT
YET
BUT
I
SHALL
THAT'S
WHY
I'VE
COME
OVER
HERE
I
COULDN'T
GET
WHAT
I
WANTED
IN
LONDON
PERHAPS
I
CAN
HERE
DO
YOU
THINK
IT'S
LIKELY
THAT
A
MAN
WILL
DO
ANY
GOOD
WHEN
HE
STARTS
AT
YOUR
AGE
MOST
MEN
BEGIN
PAINTING
AT
EIGHTEEN
I
CAN
LEARN
QUICKER
THAN
I
COULD
WHEN
I
WAS
EIGHTEEN
WHAT
MAKES
YOU
THINK
YOU
HAVE
ANY
TALENT
HE
DID
NOT
ANSWER
FOR
A
MINUTE
HIS
GAZE
RESTED
ON
THE
PASSING
THRONG
BUT
I
DO
NOT
THINK
HE
SAW
IT
HIS
ANSWER
WAS
NO
ANSWER
I'VE
GOT
TO
PAINT
AREN'T
YOU
TAKING
AN
AWFUL
CHANCE
HE
LOOKED
AT
ME
THEN
HIS
EYES
HAD
SOMETHING
STRANGE
IN
THEM
SO
THAT
I
FELT
RATHER
UNCOMFORTABLE
HOW
OLD
ARE
YOU
TWENTY-THREE
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
THE
QUESTION
WAS
BESIDE
THE
POINT
IT
WAS
NATURAL
THAT
I
SHOULD
TAKE
CHANCES
BUT
HE
WAS
A
MAN
WHOSE
YOUTH
WAS
PAST
A
STOCKBROKER
WITH
A
POSITION
OF
RESPECTABILITY
A
WIFE
AND
TWO
CHILDREN
A
COURSE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NATURAL
FOR
ME
WAS
ABSURD
FOR
HIM
I
WISHED
TO
BE
QUITE
FAIR
OF
COURSE
A
MIRACLE
MAY
HAPPEN
AND
YOU
MAY
BE
A
GREAT
PAINTER
BUT
YOU
MUST
CONFESS
THE
CHANCES
ARE
A
MILLION
TO
ONE
AGAINST
IT
IT'LL
BE
AN
AWFUL
SELL
IF
AT
THE
END
YOU
HAVE
TO
ACKNOWLEDGE
YOU'VE
MADE
A
HASH
OF
IT
I'VE
GOT
TO
PAINT
HE
REPEATED
SUPPOSING
YOU'RE
NEVER
ANYTHING
MORE
THAN
THIRD-RATE
DO
YOU
THINK
IT
WILL
HAVE
BEEN
WORTH
WHILE
TO
GIVE
UP
EVERYTHING
AFTER
ALL
IN
ANY
OTHER
WALK
OF
LIFE
IT
DOESN'T
MATTER
IF
YOU'RE
NOT
VERY
GOOD
YOU
CAN
GET
ALONG
QUITE
COMFORTABLY
IF
YOU'RE
JUST
ADEQUATE
BUT
IT'S
DIFFERENT
WITH
AN
ARTIST
YOU
BLASTED
FOOL
HE
SAID
I
DON'T
SEE
WHY
UNLESS
IT'S
FOLLY
TO
SAY
THE
OBVIOUS
I
TELL
YOU
I'VE
GOT
TO
PAINT
I
CAN'T
HELP
MYSELF
WHEN
A
MAN
FALLS
INTO
THE
WATER
IT
DOESN'T
MATTER
HOW
HE
SWIMS
WELL
OR
BADLY
HE'S
GOT
TO
GET
OUT
OR
ELSE
HE'LL
DROWN
THERE
WAS
REAL
PASSION
IN
HIS
VOICE
AND
IN
SPITE
OF
MYSELF
I
WAS
IMPRESSED
I
SEEMED
TO
FEEL
IN
HIM
SOME
VEHEMENT
POWER
THAT
WAS
STRUGGLING
WITHIN
HIM
IT
GAVE
ME
THE
SENSATION
OF
SOMETHING
VERY
STRONG
OVERMASTERING
THAT
HELD
HIM
AS
IT
WERE
AGAINST
HIS
WILL
I
COULD
NOT
UNDERSTAND
HE
SEEMED
REALLY
TO
BE
POSSESSED
OF
A
DEVIL
AND
I
FELT
THAT
IT
MIGHT
SUDDENLY
TURN
AND
REND
HIM
YET
HE
LOOKED
ORDINARY
ENOUGH
MY
EYES
RESTING
ON
HIM
CURIOUSLY
CAUSED
HIM
NO
EMBARRASSMENT
I
WONDERED
WHAT
A
STRANGER
WOULD
HAVE
TAKEN
HIM
TO
BE
SITTING
THERE
IN
HIS
OLD
NORFOLK
JACKET
AND
HIS
UNBRUSHED
BOWLER
HIS
TROUSERS
WERE
BAGGY
HIS
HANDS
WERE
NOT
CLEAN
AND
HIS
FACE
WITH
THE
RED
STUBBLE
OF
THE
UNSHAVED
CHIN
THE
LITTLE
EYES
AND
THE
LARGE
AGGRESSIVE
NOSE
WAS
UNCOUTH
AND
COARSE
HIS
MOUTH
WAS
LARGE
HIS
LIPS
WERE
HEAVY
AND
SENSUAL
NO
I
COULD
NOT
HAVE
PLACED
HIM
YOU
WON'T
GO
BACK
TO
YOUR
WIFE
I
SAID
AT
LAST
NEVER
SHE'S
WILLING
TO
FORGET
EVERYTHING
THAT'S
HAPPENED
AND
START
AFRESH
SHE'LL
NEVER
MAKE
YOU
A
SINGLE
REPROACH
SHE
CAN
GO
TO
HELL
YOU
DON'T
CARE
IF
PEOPLE
THINK
YOU
AN
UTTER
BLACKGUARD
YOU
DON'T
CARE
IF
SHE
AND
YOUR
CHILDREN
HAVE
TO
BEG
THEIR
BREAD
NOT
A
DAMN
I
WAS
SILENT
FOR
A
MOMENT
IN
ORDER
TO
GIVE
GREATER
FORCE
TO
MY
NEXT
REMARK
I
SPOKE
AS
DELIBERATELY
AS
I
COULD
YOU
ARE
A
MOST
UNMITIGATED
CAD
NOW
THAT
YOU'VE
GOT
THAT
OFF
YOUR
CHEST

GO

I
HAD
AN
INFERNAL
HEADACHE
I
HAD
LEFT
THEM
EARLY
DECLINING
A
PRESSING
INVITATION
TO
DINNER
AND
THEN
HAD
STAYED
UP
HALF
THE
NIGHT
DRINKING
WHISKY
AND
I
STILL
FELT
AS
I
PREPARED
TO
LEAVE
THE
OFFICE
RATHER
SICK
AND
GIDDY
LAST
NIGHT
STRANGELY
ENOUGH
I
HAD
NOT
FELT
TOO
DEJECTED
BUT
THIS
I
REASONED
OUT
WAS
BECAUSE
OF
A
PARTICULAR
ILLUSION
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
FOSTERED
BY
THE
WHISKY
AN
ILLUSION
TO
THE
EFFECT
THAT
I
WAS
SHORTLY
GOING
TO
DO
SOMETHING
REMARKABLE
WHICH
WOULD
MIRACULOUSLY
ALTER
THE
SITUATION
IT
WAS
UNCLEAR
WHAT
THIS
REMARKABLE
ACTION
WOULD
BE
BUT
AS
THE
NIGHT
PROCEEDED
I
MORE
AND
MORE
SENSED
ITS
MAGNIFICENT
VEILED
PRESENCE
I
HAD
NOT
IT
SEEMED
AFTER
ALL
BEEN
CHEATED
OF
MY
MOMENT
OF
POWER
TODAY
HOWEVER
I
COULD
SEE
ONLY
TOO
CLEARLY
THE
EMPTINESS
OF
THIS
DREAM
WHICH
WAS
BUT
THE
HOLLOW
CORRELATE
OF
MY
ROLE
OF
TOTAL
VICTIM
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
I
COULD
DO
NOTHING
THAT
IS
EXCEPT
ACT
OUT
WITH
DIGNITY
MY
APPOINTED
TASK
OF
BEING
RATIONAL
AND
CHARITABLE
A
TASK
WHOSE
CHARMS
NEVER
MANY
WERE
LIKELY
TO
DIMINISH
AS
MY
CHARITABLENESS
AND
RATIONALITY
CAME
TO
BE
BY
ALL
CONCERNED
INCREASINGLY
TAKEN
FOR
GRANTED
MORE
PRECISELY
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
TO
BE
DONE
IN
THE
NEAR
FUTURE
EXCEPT
TO
MAKE
SENSIBLE
ARRANGEMENTS
WITH
ANTONIA
ABOUT
THE
FURNITURE
WRITE
A
NUMBER
OF
LETTERS
ABOUT
THE
LOWNDES
SQUARE
FLAT
AND
SEE
MY
SOLICITOR
ABOUT
THE
DIVORCE
PROCEEDINGS
THAT
AND
SEE
GEORGIE
I
WAS
SORRY
THAT
I
HAD
MADE
MYSELF
SO
DRUNK
LAST
NIGHT
NOT
ONLY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
HIDEOUS
DEPRESSION
OF
THE
HANGOVER
BUT
BECAUSE
I
FELT
IT
WOULD
MAKE
ME
STUPID
IN
DEALING
WITH
GEORGIE
I
STILL
HAD
MIXED
FEELINGS
ABOUT
SEEING
HER
AND
INDEED
MY
OPPOSITE
WISHES
HAD
BOTH
INCREASED
IN
INTENSITY
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
I
FELT
MORE
THAN
EVER
ABSORBED
INTO
THE
IDEA
OF
ANTONIA
I
WANTED
TO
THINK
ABOUT
HER
ALL
THE
TIME
ALTHOUGH
THIS
ACTIVITY
WAS
ENTIRELY
PAINFUL
IN
AN
OBSESSED
WAY
WHAT
I
MOST
DESIRED
WAS
TO
BE
TALKING
OVER
THE
SITUATION
WITH
ANTONIA
OR
PALMER
AND
IF
EITHER
OF
THEM
HAD
HAD
THE
TIME
TO
INDULGE
ME
THAT
IS
WHAT
I
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CONTINUALLY
DOING
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
IMAGE
OF
GEORGIE
MOVED
BY
SOME
PURE
POWER
OF
ITS
OWN
WAS
ACTIVE
WITHIN
ME
AND
MADE
IN
MY
TORMENTED
THOUGHTS
A
COOL
AND
EVEN
AUTHORITATIVE
PLACE
FOR
ITSELF
THITHER
I
DID
FEEL
DRAWN
GEORGIE'S
ROBUST
CHEERFULNESS
HER
GOOD
SENSE
HER
LUCID
TOUGHNESS
WERE
PERHAPS
JUST
WHAT
I
REQUIRE
TO
PULL
ME
OUT
OF
THE
REGION
OF
FANTASY
WHICH
I
WAS
INCREASINGLY
INHABITING
AND
RETURN
ME
TO
THE
REAL
WORLD
YET
COULD
I
AS
THINGS
WERE
RELY
ON
GEORGIE
TO
BE
CHEERFUL
AND
LUCID
WHAT
DEMANDS
MIGHT
SHE
NOT
NOW
ESPECIALLY
FINDING
ME
IN
THIS
WEAKENED
STATE
MAKE
UPON
ME
I
UNUTTERABLY
WANTED
SOME
SIMPLICITY
OF
CONSOLATION
BUT
GEORGIE
TOO
WAS
A
PERSON
CAPABLE
OF
BEING
IN
TORMENT
I
LOCKED
UP
MY
DESK
AND
PUT
INTO
MY
BRIEF-CASE
THE
LIST
OF
CLIENTS
WHOM
I
HAD
PROMISED
TO
VISIT
IN
JANUARY
AND
THE
DRAFT
OF
MY
CHAPTER
ON
THE
TACTICS
OF
GUSTAVUS
ADOLPHUS
AT
THE
BATTLE
OF
LEUTZEN
I
HAD
MADE
ARRANGEMENTS
SO
AS
NOT
TO
HAVE
TO
COME
TO
THE
OFFICE
AGAIN
FOR
A
LITTLE
WHILE
THE
CLIENTS
WOULD
RECEIVE
A
NOTE
TO
THE
EFFECT
THAT
MR
MYTTEN
MY
YOUNG
ASSISTANT
WOULD
VISIT
THEM
INSTEAD
AS
I
WAS
INDISPOSED
MYTTEN
WAS
AT
PRESENT
STILL
IN
BORDEAUX
WHERE
IT
WAS
DANGEROUS
TO
SEND
HIM
SINCE
HE
PROLONGED
HIS
VISITS
SO
UNCONSCIONABLY
CONDUCTING
SOME
NEGOTIATIONS
WITH
A
SMALL
HOUSE
WITH
WHICH
WE
HAD
NEWLY
BEGUN
TO
DO
SOME
BUSINESS
MYTTEN
WAS
A
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
A
SYBARITE
AND
AN
ASS
BUT
HE
WAS
LOYAL
AND
A
DECENT
JUDGE
OF
WINE
AND
WENT
DOWN
SPLENDIDLY
WITH
MY
MORE
SNOBBISH
CLIENTELE
I
COULD
TRUST
HIM
WITH
THE
VISITING
THOUGH
NOT
OF
COURSE
WITH
THE
TASTING
AND
I
NOTED
THAT
MY
NEXT
ESSENTIAL
ENGAGEMENT
WAS
TO
TASTE
HOCK
OF
WHICH
WE
STILL
HANDLED
A
LITTLE
ON
JANUARY
TH
OF
COURSE
I
ALWAYS
POLITELY
CONSULTED
MYTTEN
AND
VERY
OCCASIONALLY
LISTENED
TO
HIS
ADVICE
ON
WHAT
TO
BUY
BUT
A
DIRECTOR
OF
A
SMALL
WINE
FIRM
TENDS
TO
BECOME
AN
OMNIPOTENT
AND
JEALOUS
DEITY
AND
IT
WAS
ON
MY
PALATE
ALONE
THAT
THE
FIRM
OF
LYNCH-GIBBON
DEPENDED
AND
AS
I
HAD
NO
PATERNAL
FEELINGS
TOWARDS
MYTTEN
AND
DID
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
I
COULD
TRAIN
HIM
TO
BE
A
SECOND
ME
THE
LITTLE
FIRM
WOULD
DOUBTLESS
PERISH
WITH
ME
AND
THE
PARTICULAR
PIECE
OF
REALITY
REPRESENTED
BY
THE
DISCERNING
TASTE
WHICH
MY
FATHER
HAD
SO
CAREFULLY
TRAINED
AND
FOSTERED
IN
HIS
SON
WOULD
VANISH
AWAY
FOREVER
UNTIL
THE
TRUANT
MYTTEN'S
RETURN
MY
TWO
EXCELLENT
SECRETARIES
MISS
HERNSHAW
AND
MISS
SEELHAFT
COULD
GET
ON
PERFECTLY
WELL
ON
THEIR
OWN
I
PRIZED
THESE
GIRLS
EXCEEDINGLY
AS
THEY
COULD
WRITE
ACCURATE
AND
EVEN
WITTY
BUSINESS
LETTERS
IN
FRENCH
AND
GERMAN
AND
BY
NOW
KNEW
THE
BUSINESS
VERY
WELL
INDEED
THOUGH
QUAINTLY
THEY
HAD
NO
UNDERSTANDING
OF
WINE
AND
PRAISED
ANYTHING
THAT
WAS
OFFERED
TO
THEM
THEY
HAD
BEEN
WITH
ME
FOR
SOME
YEARS
NOW
AND
I
HAD
BEEN
VERY
WORRIED
IN
CASE
ONE
OR
OTHER
OF
THEM
SHOULD
TAKE
IT
INTO
HER
HEAD
TO
GET
MARRIED
UNTIL
THE
DAY
WHEN
I
REALISED
THROUGH
SOME
IMPERCEPTIBLE
BUT
CUMULATIVE
GATHERING
OF
IMPRESSIONS
THAT
THEY
WERE
A
HAPPY
AND
WELL-SUITED
LESBIAN
COUPLE
TODAY
I
HAD
WITH
EACH
OF
THEM
SEPARATELY
GONE
THROUGH
THE
PAINFUL
BUSINESS
OF
TELLING
THEM
ABOUT
MY
DIVORCE
I
WAS
MADE
AWARE
THAT
THEY
ALREADY
KNEW
SO
GLEEFULLY
FAST
DOES
BAD
NEWS
TRAVEL
THEY
STOOD
NOW
BY
THE
DOOR
WAITING
WITHOUT
VISIBLE
IMPATIENCE
TO
SEE
THE
LAST
OF
ME
THEIR
FACES
AND
ATTITUDES
EXPRESSED
THEIR
RESPECTIVE
MODES
OF
SYMPATHY
TALL
FAIR
MISS
HERNSHAW
LONG
VAINLY
COURTED
BY
THE
IMPERCEPTIVE
MYTTEN
SWAYING
MOIST-EYED
AND
READY
TO
HOLD
MY
HAND
SHORT
DARK
MISS
SEELHAFT
FROWNING
WITH
CONCERN
AS
SHE
POLISHED
HER
SPECTACLES
DARTING
ME
GLANCES
OF
BRISK
COMMISERATION
I
LEFT
THEM
AT
LAST
TO
THE
DBRIS
OF
THE
CHRISTMAS
ORDERS
AND
THE
JOYS
OF
EACH
OTHER'S
COMPANY
AND
DROVE
MY
CAR
TO
PELHAM
CRESCENT
ANTONIA
WAS
WEARING
A
BROWN
CASHMERE
PULLOVER
AND
A
STRING
OF
PEARLS
NEITHER
OF
WHICH
I
HAD
SEEN
BEFORE
SHE
HAD
NEVER
USED
TO
BUY
SO
MUCH
AS
A
HANDKERCHIEF
WITHOUT
CONSULTING
ME
I
NOTICED
TOO
HALF
RELIEVED
THAT
SHE
WAS
IN
A
STATE
OF
RESTLESS
IRRITATION
AND
IN
NO
MOOD
TO
PLY
ME
WITH
HER
TENDERNESS
SHE
JUMPED
UP
WHEN
SHE
SAW
ME
AND
SAID
REALLY
I
THINK
SHE
MIGHT
HAVE
WAITED
A
BIT
BEFORE
DISMANTLING
THE
HOUSE!
WHO
HONOR
KLEIN
I
RECALLED
THIS
LADY'S
EXISTENCE
I
SUPPOSE
SHE'S
TAKING
HER
OWN
STUFF
AWAY
DARLING
SHUT
THE
DOOR
SAID
ANTONIA
I
FEEL
HAUNTED
I
SUPPOSE
SHE
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
HER
OWN
THINGS
BUT
REALLY
WHEN
SHE
APPEARED
HERE
THIS
MORNING
IT
WAS
LIKE
BEING
HIT
BY
A
TORNADO
DID
YOU
SEE
ALL
THE
JUNK
PILED
UP
IN
THE
HALL
APPEARED
THIS
MORNING
ISN'T
SHE
STAYING
HERE
NO
THAT
WAS
ANOTHER
THING
AND
AFTER
I'D
SPENT
AGES
GETTING
HER
ROOM
READY
SHE
DECIDED
LAST
NIGHT
SHE
WANTED
TO
STAY
IN
A
HOTEL
IN
BLOOMSBURY
TO
BE
NEAR
THE
BRITISH
MUSEUM
OR
SOMETHING
AND
POOR
ANDERSON
HAD
TO
TAKE
HER
AWAY
IN
A
TAXI
AND
HE'S
NOT
AT
ALL
WELL
AND
HE
TOOK
AGES
GETTING
BACK
IN
THE
FOG
HOW
IS
PALMER
HIS
TEMPERATURE'S
STILL
UP
IT
WAS
NINETY-NINE
THIS
MORNING
I
DO
THINK
SHE'S
INCONSIDERATE
ALL
THE
SAME
I
LIKE
HER
I
LAUGHED
AT
THE
DETERMINED
WAY
ANTONIA
SAID
THIS
YOU
HAVE
TO
SHE'S
PALMER'S
SISTER
I
CONFESS
I
DON'T
FEEL
MYSELF
OBLIGED
IN
THIS
RESPECT!
ABOUT
THE
FURNITURE
DARLING
SAID
ANTONIA
MAY
WE
DO
IT
TOMORROW
AFTERNOON
ANDERSON
AND
I
ARE
JUST
OFF
TO
MARLOW
WE
THOUGHT
WE'D
STAY
AT
THE
COMPLEAT
ANGLER
JUST
FOR
THE
NIGHT
IT'S
SUCH
A
NICE
WARM
HOTEL
POOR
ANDERSON
IS
SO
OVERTIRED
I
THOUGHT
THE
LITTLE
CHANGE
WOULD
DO
HIM
GOOD
AND
WE
BOTH
HATE
SEEING
HONOR
MAULING
THE
HOUSE
I'M
TERRIBLY
SORRY
NOT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
ASK
YOU
TO
LUNCH
BUT
WE'RE
HAVING
IT
EARLY
IN
RATHER
A
RUSH
AND
LEAVING
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
I
HAD
INTRODUCED
ANTONIA
TO
THE
COMPLEAT
ANGLER
IT
HAD
BEEN
ONE
OF
OUR
HAUNTS
IN
THE
EARLY
DAYS
OF
OUR
MARRIAGE
I
COULDN'T
ANYWAY
I
SAID
I'M
JUST
LEAVING
TOWN
MYSELF
BUT
I'LL
BE
BACK
EARLY
TOMORROW
SEE
YOU
AT
HEREFORD
SQUARE
ANY
TIME
AFTER
THREE
I
TOLD
THIS
LIE
INSTINCTIVELY
AS
A
REJOINDER
TO
ANTONIA'S
AIR
OF
SOMEWHAT
PATRONISING
SOLICITUDE
AND
I
HAD
THE
SATISFACTION
OF
SEEING
HER
INHIBIT
HER
IMPULSE
TO
ASK
ME
WHERE
I
WAS
GOING
SHE
HAD
AFTER
ALL
SURRENDERED
CERTAIN
RIGHTS
THE
THREAD
WAS
NOT
BROKEN
BUT
WITHOUT
OUR
NOTICE
AND
WITHOUT
OUR
WILL
THE
GULF
HAD
INEVITABLY
GROWN
WIDER
SHE
SIGHED
AND
I
TOOK
MY
LEAVE
BEFORE
SHE
COULD
DISCOVER
THE
WORDS
WITH
WHICH
TO
DRAW
ME
GENTLY
ONCE
MORE
TOWARDS
HER
I
CLOSED
THE
DRAWING-ROOM
DOOR
UPON
ANTONIA
AND
ALMOST
FELL
OVER
HONOR
KLEIN
WHO
WAS
HALF
CARRYING
HALF
DRAGGING
A
LARGE
BOX
OF
BOOKS
ACROSS
THE
HALL
I
SAID
MAY
I
HELP
YOU
AND
TOGETHER
WE
HAULED
THE
BOX
INTO
THE
BIG
FRONT
ROOM
WHICH
PALMER
ALWAYS
CALLED
THE
LIBRARY
ALTHOUGH
IT
CONTAINED
ONLY
ONE
SMALL
BOOKCASE
THE
ROOM
WAS
IN
DISORDER
NOW
PILED
UP
WITH
TEA
CHESTS
CONTAINING
BOOKS
PAPERS
AND
PHOTOGRAPHS
A
NUMBER
OF
PICTURES
WERE
STACKED
AGAINST
THE
WALL
INCLUDING
THE
SERIES
OF
JAPANESE
PRINTS
FROM
THE
STUDY
I
NOTICED
TOO
HALF
HIDDEN
BY
A
HEAP
OF
LETTERS
A
FRAMED
PHOTOGRAPH
OF
WHAT
WAS
OBVIOUSLY
PALMER
AS
A
BOY
OF
SIXTEEN
IN
THE
DINING-ROOM
OPPOSITE
I
SAW
THROUGH
THE
DOOR
THE
TABLE
LAID
FOR
LUNCH
AND
AN
OPEN
BOTTLE
OF
LYNCH-GIBBON
CLARET
ONLY
TWO
PLACES
WERE
LAID
THANK
YOU
SAID
HONOR
KLEIN
NOW
WOULD
YOU
MIND
HELPING
ME
STACK
THESE
BOXES
ON
TOP
OF
EACH
OTHER
I
SHALL
NEED
THE
SPACE
WHEN
WE
HAD
FINISHED
THIS
AND
I
WISHED
TO
TAKE
MY
LEAVE
BUT
COULD
THINK
OF
NO
SUITABLE
FORMULA
I
BOWED
RATHER
AWKWARDLY
AND
WAS
ABOUT
TO
WITHDRAW
WHEN
SHE
SAID
YESTERDAY
YOU
ASKED
ME
WHAT
I
THOUGHT
OF
MY
BROTHER'S
EXPLOIT
MAY
I
ASK
WHAT
YOU
THINK
OF
IT
THIS
TOOK
ME
GREATLY
BY
SURPRISE
AND
I
HESITATED
FOR
WORDS
I
WAS
AT
ONCE
AWARE
THAT
I
MUST
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
WHAT
I
SAID
TO
HONOR
KLEIN
SHE
WENT
ON
DO
YOU
THINK
THEY
ARE
DOING
THE
RIGHT
THING
DO
YOU
MEAN
MORALLY
NO
NOT
MORALLY
SHE
SAID
ALMOST
WITH
SCORN
I
MEAN
FOR
THEIR
LIFE
SHE
CONTRIVED
TO
GIVE
THE
WORD
A
METAPHYSICAL
RING
I
SAID
YES
I
DO
THINK
THEY
ARE
DOING
THE
RIGHT
THING
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
HIDEOUSLY
IMPROPER
IN
DISCUSSING
ANTONIA'S
BUSINESS
WITH
THIS
WOMAN
YET
I
FOUND
SUDDENLY
THAT
I
WANTED
TO
DO
YOU
MIND
IF
I
CLOSE
THE
DOOR
SHE
SAID
SHE
STOOD
WITH
HER
BACK
TO
IT
STARING
AT
ME
WITH
A
CONCENTRATED
CALCULATING
EXPRESSION
SHE
WAS
WEARING
A
DARK
GREEN
COAT
AND
SKIRT
WHICH
HAD
ONCE
HAD
SOME
PRETENSION
TO
SMARTNESS
AND
SHE
LOOKED
RATHER
LESS
DUMPY
THAN
SHE
HAD
SEEMED
AT
THE
STATION
HER
BLUNT
LACED
SHOES
HAD
BEEN
POLISHED
SINCE
YESTERDAY
HER
SHORT
STRAIGHT
OILY
HAIR
A
LUSTROUS
BLACK
SAT
LIKE
A
CROPPED
WIG
ABOUT
HER
PALE
RATHER
WAXEN
JEWISH
FACE
HER
NARROW
EYES
WERE
LIKE
TWO
BLACK
CHIPS
SHE
SAID
I
WONDER
IF
YOU
REALISE
HOW
MUCH
YOUR
SOFT
BEHAVIOUR
DISMAYS
THEM
I
WAS
SURPRISED
AGAIN
YOU
ARE
WRONG
I
SAID
I
ADDED
IN
ANY
CASE
I
AM
POWERLESS
IF
I
CHOOSE
TO
BE
CIVILISED
IT
IS
MY
OWN
AFFAIR
I
GLARED
BACK
AT
HER
ALL
THE
SAME
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
REFRESHING
EVEN
EXHILARATING
EVEN
LIBERATING
AFTER
SO
MUCH
OF
THE
TENDER
AND
THE
POLITE
AFTER
ANTONIA
AND
PALMER'S
MASTERLY
WRAPPING
ABOUT
THIS
DIRECT
TALK
CIVILISED!
SHE
SAID
IT
AGAIN
WITH
SCORN
AS
YOU
MUST
KNOW
PERFECTLY
WELL
YOU
COULD
GET
YOUR
WIFE
BACK
IF
YOU
WANTED
HER
EVEN
NOW
I
DON'T
SAY
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
BEATEN
HER
AND
KICKED
MY
BROTHER
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
NEED
TO
PRESS
THEM
SO
INTO
EACH
OTHER'S
ARMS
THEY
ARE
BOTH
PERSONS
WITH
A
GREAT
CAPACITY
FOR
SELF-DECEPTION
THEY
HAVE
ENCHANTED
THEMSELVES
INTO
A
BELIEF
IN
THIS
MATCH
BUT
THEY
ARE
BOTH
CRAMMED
WITH
MISGIVINGS
THEY
WANT
TO
BE
LET
OFF
THE
FINAL
DECISION
THEY
LOOK
TO
YOU
FOR
HELP
CAN
YOU
NOT
SEE
THAT
I
WAS
AMAZED
I
SAID
NO
FRANKLY
I
CAN'T
SEE
IT
I
CAN
BEST
HELP
THEM
BY
BEING
GENTLE
AND
I
PROPOSE
TO
GO
ON
BEING
GENTLE
I
AM
AFTER
ALL
IN
A
POSITION
TO
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
ABOUT
BOTH
OF
THEM
I
SPOKE
FIRMLY
BUT
I
WAS
VERY
UPSET
BY
WHAT
SHE
HAD
SAID
AND
CONFUSED
AND
UNSURE
WHETHER
I
OUGHT
NOT
TO
BE
OFFENDED
I
TOOK
A
STEP
FORWARD
TO
INDICATE
THAT
I
WISHED
TO
GO
BUT
SHE
STOOD
HER
GROUND
THROWING
HER
HEAD
BACK
AGAINST
THE
DOOR
AND
LOOKING
UP
AT
ME
TRUTH
HAS
BEEN
LOST
LONG
AGO
IN
THIS
SITUATION
SHE
SAID
IN
SUCH
MATTERS
YOU
CANNOT
HAVE
BOTH
TRUTH
AND
WHAT
YOU
CALL
CIVILISATION
YOU
ARE
A
VIOLENT
MAN
MR
LYNCH-GIBBON
YOU
CANNOT
GET
AWAY
WITH
THIS
INTIMACY
WITH
YOUR
WIFE'S
SEDUCER
I
AM
NOT
ONE

DR

I

AND
I
DO
NOT

WITH
THAT
I
RECALLED
HOW
SHE
HERSELF
HAD
BEEN
CALLED
PRIMITIVE
STRAINED
BACK
AGAINST

CLOSE
TO

NOW
SHE
SEEMED
SOMETHING
BLACK
AND
UNTOUCHABLE
YOU
CANNOT
CHEAT
THE
DARK

MR
LYNCH-GIBBON
SHE
SAID
SOFTLY
PERHAPS
IT
IS
NO
BUSINESS
OF
MINE
IF
YOU
CHOOSE
TO
BE
POWERLESS
AND
TO
ABANDON
YOUR
WIFE
BUT
EVERYTHING
IN
THIS
LIFE
HAS
TO
BE
PAID
FOR
AND
LOVE
TOO
HAS
TO
BE
PAID
FOR
WHY
DOES
MY
BROTHER
WHO
IS
RICH
ALWAYS
CHARGE
HIGH
FEES
EVEN
TO
POOR
PATIENTS
BECAUSE
WITHOUT
PAYMENT
HE
COULD
NOT
SPEAK
TO
THEIR
CONDITION
WITHOUT
PAYMENT
THEY
WOULD
BE
WRETCHED
THEY
WOULD
BE
CAPTIVES
I
BELIEVE
YOU
LOVE
MY
BROTHER
BUT
YOU
DO
HIM
NO
GOOD
BY
LETTING
HIM
OFF
HE
WANTS
HE
NEEDS
YOUR
HARSHNESS
YOUR
CRITICISM
EVEN
YOUR
VIOLENCE
BY
GENTLENESS
YOU
ONLY
SPARE
YOURSELF
AND
PROLONG
THIS
ENCHANTMENT
OF
UNTRUTH
WHICH
THEY
HAVE
WOVEN
ABOUT
THEMSELVES
AND
ABOUT
YOU
TOO
SOONER
OR
LATER
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TO
BECOME
A
CENTAUR
AND
KICK
YOUR
WAY
OUT
I
LISTENED
TO
HER
WITH
GREAT
ATTENTION
I
WANTED
TO
UNDERSTAND
EXACTLY
WHAT
SHE
MEANT
YOU
SAID
EARLIER
THAT
YOU
THOUGHT
THEY
BOTH
WANTED
TO
BACK
OUT
I
SAID
BUT
WHAT
YOU
SAY
NOW
COULD
IMPLY
THAT
IF
I
WERE
VIOLENT
IT
MIGHT
MAKE
THEM
HAPPIER
WITH
EACH
OTHER
HONOR
KLEIN
GAVE
A
TIRED
GESTURE
THE
TENSION
LEFT
HER
BODY
AND
SHE
DROOPED
MOVING
A
LITTLE
AWAY
FROM
THE
DOOR
COULD
IMPLY
COULD
IMPLY!
SHE
SAID
WHERE
LOGIC
BREAKS
DOWN
ANYTHING
CAN
IMPLY
ANYTHING
WHILE
YOU
ARE
ALL
SO
SOFT
NOTHING
CAN
BE
CLEAR
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
NOW
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
REALLY
WANT
YOUR
WIFE
BACK
AFTER
ALL
AND
AS
I
AM
SURPRISED
THAT
YOU
HAVE
NOT
YET
TOLD
ME
IT
IS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
ME
YOUR
SIDE
OF
THE
MATTER
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
LET
THEM
STEAL
YOUR
MIND
AND
ORGANISE
YOU
AS
IF
YOU
WERE
AN
INFANT
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
IS
YOUR
AFFAIR
ALL
I
SAY
IS
THAT
ONLY
LIES
AND
EVIL
COME
FROM
LETTING
PEOPLE
OFF
I
LOOKED
AT
HER
HARSH
AND
MELANCHOLY
PROFILE
I
SAID
I
DON'T
IMAGINE
THAT
YOU
EVER
LET
PEOPLE
OFF
DO
YOU
DR
KLEIN

AND
SUDDENLY

NARROWING

HAS
GROWN

A

I
SAID
AT

THAT
I
FIND
IN

THE
CLUE

WELL
I
CERTAINLY
IMAGINE
IT
IS

THERE
HAVE
BEEN

STRUCK

A

IN
CROMWELL
ROAD
QUITE
SUDDENLY
AS
I
LOOKED
OVER
THE
NATURAL
HISTORY
MUSEUM
BY

BUT
THIS
IS
THE
LITTLE
ASSEMBLAGE
OF
CASES
OF
STUFFED
BIRDS
AND

UPON
THE
BLADESOVER
STAIRCASE
GROWN
ENORMOUS
AND
YONDER
AS
THE

THAT
I
HUNTED
OUT
IN

PUT
TOGETHER

DIVING
INTO

MUSEUM
UNDER
THIS
INSPIRATION
I
CAME
TO
A
LITTLE
READING-ROOM
AND
FOUND
AS
I
HAD
INFERRED
OLD
BROWN
BOOKS!
IT
WAS
REALLY
A
GOOD
PIECE
OF
SOCIAL
COMPARATIVE
ANATOMY
I
DID
THAT
DAY
ALL
THESE
MUSEUMS
AND
LIBRARIES
THAT
ARE
DOTTED
OVER

KENSINGTON

INDEED

BECAME
AS
IT
WERE
THE
LAST
DWINDLED
REPRESENTATIVE
OF
SUCH
A
MAN
OF
LETTERS
AS
SWIFT
BUT
NOW
THESE
THINGS
HAVE
ESCAPED
OUT
OF
THE
GREAT

ALTOGETHER
AND
TAKEN
ON
A
STRANGE
INDEPENDENT
LIFE
OF
THEIR
OWN
IT
IS
THIS
IDEA
OF
ESCAPING
PARTS
FROM
THE
SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY
SYSTEM
OF
BLADESOVER
OF
PROLIFERATING
AND
OVERGROWING
ELEMENTS
FROM

TO

LONDON
DAYS
IN
THOSE
DAYS
THEY
HAD
BEEN
BUT
LIGHTLY
TOUCHED
BY
THE
AMERICAN'S
PROFANING
HAND
AND
IN

I
FOUND
THE
DOCTOR'S
HOUSE
OF
THE
COUNTRY
VILLAGE
OR
COUNTRY
TOWN
UP
AND
DOWN
HARLEY
STREET
MULTIPLIED

NOT
OTHERWISE
DIFFERENT

SOLICITOR
BY
THE
HUNDRED
FURTHER
EASTWARD
IN

ABANDONED
HOUSES
OF
A

OF

AND
DOWN
IN
WESTMINSTER
BEHIND
PALLADIAN
FRONTS
THE

OFFICES
SHELTERED
IN
LARGE
BLADESOVERISH
ROOMS
AND
LOOKED
OUT
ON
ST
JAMES'S

THE
PARLIAMENT
HOUSES

MORE
I
HAVE
PARALLELED

THE

EVIDENT
IT
HAS
BECOME
TO

IS

EAGLE-NOSED
PEOPLE
TALKING
SOME
INCOMPREHENSIBLE
GIBBERISH
BETWEEN

SHOPS
AND
THE
BARROWS
AND
SOON
I
BECAME
QUITE
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
DEVIOUS
VICIOUS
DIRTILY-PLEASANT
EXOTICISM
OF
SOHO
I
FOUND
THOSE
CROWDED
STREETS
A
VAST

DULL
GREY
EXTERIOR
OF

WHERE
I
LODGED
AND
LIVED

WE
CAN
ONLY
GO
ON
PATIENTLY
PUTTING
THE
TRUTH
BEFORE
THEM
IT
ISN'T
THEM
SHE
CONTINUED
TAKING
HEART
FROM
HER
SIGHT
OF
THE
TRAFFIC
IT'S
THEIR
LEADERS
IT'S
THOSE
GENTLEMEN
SITTING
IN
PARLIAMENT
AND
DRAWING
FOUR
HUNDRED
A
YEAR
OF
THE
PEOPLE'S
MONEY
IF
WE
HAD
TO
PUT
OUR
CASE
TO
THE
PEOPLE
WE
SHOULD
SOON
HAVE
JUSTICE
DONE
TO
US
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
BELIEVED
IN
THE
PEOPLE
AND
I
DO
SO
STILL
BUT
SHE
SHOOK
HER
HEAD
AND
IMPLIED
THAT
SHE
WOULD
GIVE
THEM
ONE
MORE
CHANCE
AND
IF
THEY
DIDN'T
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THAT
SHE
COULDN'T
ANSWER
FOR
THE
CONSEQUENCES
MR
CLACTON'S
ATTITUDE
WAS
MORE
PHILOSOPHICAL
AND
BETTER
SUPPORTED
BY
STATISTICS
HE
CAME
INTO
THE
ROOM
AFTER
MRS
SEAL'S
OUTBURST
AND
POINTED
OUT
WITH
HISTORICAL
ILLUSTRATIONS
THAT
SUCH
REVERSES
HAD
HAPPENED
IN
EVERY
POLITICAL
CAMPAIGN
OF
ANY
IMPORTANCE
IF
ANYTHING
HIS
SPIRITS
WERE
IMPROVED
BY
THE
DISASTER
THE
ENEMY
HE
SAID
HAD
TAKEN
THE
OFFENSIVE
AND
IT
WAS
NOW
UP
TO
THE
SOCIETY
TO
OUTWIT
THE
ENEMY
HE
GAVE
MARY
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
HE
HAD
TAKEN
THE
MEASURE
OF
THEIR
CUNNING
AND
HAD
ALREADY
BENT
HIS
MIND
TO
THE
TASK
WHICH
SO
FAR
AS
SHE
COULD
MAKE
OUT
DEPENDED
SOLELY
UPON
HIM
IT
DEPENDED
SO
SHE
CAME
TO
THINK
WHEN
INVITED
INTO
HIS
ROOM
FOR
A
PRIVATE
CONFERENCE
UPON
A
SYSTEMATIC
REVISION
OF
THE
CARD-INDEX
UPON
THE
ISSUE
OF
CERTAIN
NEW
LEMON-COLOURED
LEAFLETS
IN
WHICH
THE
FACTS
WERE
MARSHALLED
ONCE
MORE
IN
A
VERY
STRIKING
WAY
AND
UPON
A
LARGE
SCALE
MAP
OF
ENGLAND
DOTTED
WITH
LITTLE
PINS
TUFTED
WITH
DIFFERENTLY
COLOURED
PLUMES
OF
HAIR
ACCORDING
TO
THEIR
GEOGRAPHICAL
POSITION
EACH
DISTRICT
UNDER
THE
NEW
SYSTEM
HAD
ITS
FLAG
ITS
BOTTLE
OF
INK
ITS
SHEAF
OF
DOCUMENTS
TABULATED
AND
FILED
FOR
REFERENCE
IN
A
DRAWER
SO
THAT
BY
LOOKING
UNDER
M
OR
S
AS
THE
CASE
MIGHT
BE
YOU
HAD
ALL
THE
FACTS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
SUFFRAGE
ORGANIZATIONS
OF
THE
COUNTY
AT
YOUR
FINGERS
ENDS
THIS
WOULD
REQUIRE
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
WORK
OF
COURSE
WE
MUST
TRY
TO
CONSIDER
OURSELVES
RATHER
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
A
TELEPHONE
EXCHANGE
FOR
THE
EXCHANGE
OF
IDEAS
MISS
DATCHET
HE
SAID
AND
TAKING
PLEASURE
IN
HIS
IMAGE
HE
CONTINUED
IT
WE
SHOULD
CONSIDER
OURSELVES
THE
CENTRE
OF
AN
ENORMOUS
SYSTEM
OF
WIRES
CONNECTING
US
UP
WITH
EVERY
DISTRICT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
WE
MUST
HAVE
OUR
FINGERS
UPON
THE
PULSE
OF
THE
COMMUNITY
WE
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHAT
PEOPLE
ALL
OVER
ENGLAND
ARE
THINKING
WE
WANT
TO
PUT
THEM
IN
THE
WAY
OF
THINKING
RIGHTLY
THE
SYSTEM
OF
COURSE
WAS
ONLY
ROUGHLY
SKETCHED
SO
FAR-JOTTED
DOWN
IN
FACT
DURING
THE
CHRISTMAS
HOLIDAYS
WHEN
YOU
OUGHT
TO
HAVE
BEEN
TAKING
A
REST
MR
CLACTON
SAID
MARY
DUTIFULLY
BUT
HER
TONE
WAS
FLAT
AND
TIRED
WE
LEARN
TO
DO
WITHOUT
HOLIDAYS
MISS
DATCHET
SAID
MR
CLACTON
WITH
A
SPARK
OF
SATISFACTION
IN
HIS
EYE
HE
WISHED
PARTICULARLY
TO
HAVE
HER
OPINION
OF
THE
LEMON-COLOURED
LEAFLET
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
PLAN
IT
WAS
TO
BE
DISTRIBUTED
IN
IMMENSE
QUANTITIES
IMMEDIATELY
IN
ORDER
TO
STIMULATE
AND
GENERATE
TO
GENERATE
AND
STIMULATE
HE
REPEATED
RIGHT
THOUGHTS
IN
THE
COUNTRY
BEFORE
THE
MEETING
OF
PARLIAMENT
WE
HAVE
TO
TAKE
THE
ENEMY
BY
SURPRISE
HE
SAID
THEY
DON'T
LET
THE
GRASS
GROW
UNDER
THEIR
FEET
HAVE
YOU
SEEN
BINGHAM'S
ADDRESS
TO
HIS
CONSTITUENTS
THAT'S
A
HINT
OF
THE
SORT
OF
THING
WE'VE
GOT
TO
MEET
MISS
DATCHET
HE
HANDED
HER
A
GREAT
BUNDLE
OF
NEWSPAPER
CUTTINGS
AND
BEGGING
HER
TO
GIVE
HIM
HER
VIEWS
UPON
THE
YELLOW
LEAFLET
BEFORE
LUNCH-TIME
HE
TURNED
WITH
ALACRITY
TO
HIS
DIFFERENT
SHEETS
OF
PAPER
AND
HIS
DIFFERENT
BOTTLES
OF
INK
MARY
SHUT
THE
DOOR
LAID
THE
DOCUMENTS
UPON
HER
TABLE
AND
SANK
HER
HEAD
ON
HER
HANDS
HER
BRAIN
WAS
CURIOUSLY
EMPTY
OF
ANY
THOUGHT
SHE
LISTENED
AS
IF
PERHAPS
BY
LISTENING
SHE
WOULD
BECOME
MERGED
AGAIN
IN
THE
ATMOSPHERE
OF
THE
OFFICE
FROM
THE
NEXT
ROOM
CAME
THE
RAPID
SPASMODIC
SOUNDS
OF
MRS
SEAL'S
ERRATIC
TYPEWRITING
SHE
DOUBTLESS
WAS
ALREADY
HARD
AT
WORK
HELPING
THE
PEOPLE
OF
ENGLAND
AS
MR
CLACTON
PUT
IT
TO
THINK
RIGHTLY
GENERATING
AND
STIMULATING
THOSE
WERE
HIS
WORDS
SHE
WAS
STRIKING
A
BLOW
AGAINST
THE
ENEMY
NO
DOUBT
WHO
DIDN'T
LET
THE
GRASS
GROW
BENEATH
THEIR
FEET
MR
CLACTON'S
WORDS
REPEATED
THEMSELVES
ACCURATELY
IN
HER
BRAIN
SHE
PUSHED
THE
PAPERS
WEARILY
OVER
TO
THE
FARTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
TABLE
IT
WAS
NO
USE
THOUGH
SOMETHING
OR
OTHER
HAD
HAPPENED
TO
HER
BRAIN
A
CHANGE
OF
FOCUS
SO
THAT
NEAR
THINGS
WERE
INDISTINCT
AGAIN
THE
SAME
THING
HAD
HAPPENED
TO
HER
ONCE
BEFORE
SHE
REMEMBERED
AFTER
SHE
HAD
MET
RALPH
IN
THE
GARDENS
OF
LINCOLN'S
INN
FIELDS
SHE
HAD
SPENT
THE
WHOLE
OF
A
COMMITTEE
MEETING
IN
THINKING
ABOUT
SPARROWS
AND
COLOURS
UNTIL
ALMOST
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
MEETING
HER
OLD
CONVICTIONS
HAD
ALL
COME
BACK
TO
HER
BUT
THEY
HAD
ONLY
COME
BACK
SHE
THOUGHT
WITH
SCORN
AT
HER
FEEBLENESS
BECAUSE
SHE
WANTED
TO
USE
THEM
TO
FIGHT
AGAINST
RALPH
THEY
WEREN'T
RIGHTLY
SPEAKING
CONVICTIONS
AT
ALL
SHE
COULD
NOT
SEE
THE
WORLD
DIVIDED
INTO
SEPARATE
COMPARTMENTS
OF
GOOD
PEOPLE
AND
BAD
PEOPLE
ANY
MORE
THAN
SHE
COULD
BELIEVE
SO
IMPLICITLY
IN
THE
RIGHTNESS
OF
HER
OWN
THOUGHT
AS
TO
WISH
TO
BRING
THE
POPULATION
OF
THE
BRITISH
ISLES
INTO
AGREEMENT
WITH
IT
SHE
LOOKED
AT
THE
LEMON-COLOURED
LEAFLET
AND
THOUGHT
ALMOST
ENVIOUSLY
OF
THE
FAITH
WHICH
COULD
FIND
COMFORT
IN
THE
ISSUE
OF
SUCH
DOCUMENTS
FOR
HERSELF
SHE
WOULD
BE
CONTENT
TO
REMAIN
SILENT
FOR
EVER
IF
A
SHARE
OF
PERSONAL
HAPPINESS
WERE
GRANTED
HER
SHE
READ
MR
CLACTON'S
STATEMENT
WITH
A
CURIOUS
DIVISION
OF
JUDGMENT
NOTING
ITS
WEAK
AND
POMPOUS
VERBOSITY
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
FEELING
THAT
FAITH
FAITH
IN
AN
ILLUSION
PERHAPS
BUT
AT
ANY
RATE
FAITH
IN
SOMETHING
WAS
OF
ALL
GIFTS
THE
MOST
TO
BE
ENVIED
AN
ILLUSION
IT
WAS
NO
DOUBT
SHE
LOOKED
CURIOUSLY
ROUND
HER
AT
THE
FURNITURE
OF
THE
OFFICE
AT
THE
MACHINERY
IN
WHICH
SHE
HAD
TAKEN
SO
MUCH
PRIDE
AND
MARVELLED
TO
THINK
THAT
ONCE
THE
COPYING-PRESSES
THE
CARD-INDEX
THE
FILES
OF
DOCUMENTS
HAD
ALL
BEEN
SHROUDED
WRAPPED
IN
SOME
MIST
WHICH
GAVE
THEM
A
UNITY
AND
A
GENERAL
DIGNITY
AND
PURPOSE
INDEPENDENTLY
OF
THEIR
SEPARATE
SIGNIFICANCE
THE
UGLY
CUMBERSOMENESS
OF
THE
FURNITURE
ALONE
IMPRESSED
HER
NOW
HER
ATTITUDE
HAD
BECOME
VERY
LAX
AND
DESPONDENT
WHEN
THE
TYPEWRITER
STOPPED
IN
THE
NEXT
ROOM
MARY
IMMEDIATELY
DREW
UP
TO
THE
TABLE
LAID
HANDS
ON
AN
UNOPENED
ENVELOPE
AND
ADOPTED
AN
EXPRESSION
WHICH
MIGHT
HIDE
HER
STATE
OF
MIND
FROM
MRS
SEAL
SOME
INSTINCT
OF
DECENCY
REQUIRED
THAT
SHE
SHOULD
NOT
ALLOW
MRS
SEAL
TO
SEE
HER
FACE
SHADING
HER
EYES
WITH
HER
FINGERS
SHE
WATCHED
MRS
SEAL
PULL
OUT
ONE
DRAWER
AFTER
ANOTHER
IN
HER
SEARCH
FOR
SOME
ENVELOPE
OR
LEAFLET
SHE
WAS
TEMPTED
TO
DROP
HER
FINGERS
AND
EXCLAIM
DO
SIT
DOWN
SALLY
AND
TELL
ME
HOW
YOU
MANAGE
IT
HOW
YOU
MANAGE
THAT
IS
TO
BUSTLE
ABOUT
WITH
PERFECT
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE
NECESSITY
OF
YOUR
OWN
ACTIVITIES
WHICH
TO
ME
SEEM
AS
FUTILE
AS
THE
BUZZING
OF
A
BELATED
BLUEBOTTLE
SHE
SAID
NOTHING
OF
THE
KIND
HOWEVER
AND
THE
PRETENCE
OF
INDUSTRY
WHICH
SHE
PRESERVED
SO
LONG
AS
MRS
SEAL
WAS
IN
THE
ROOM
SERVED
TO
SET
HER
BRAIN
IN
MOTION
SO
THAT
SHE
DISPATCHED
HER
MORNING'S
WORK
MUCH
AS
USUAL
AT
ONE
O'CLOCK
SHE
WAS
SURPRISED
TO
FIND
HOW
EFFICIENTLY
SHE
HAD
DEALT
WITH
THE
MORNING
AS
SHE
PUT
HER
HAT
ON
SHE
DETERMINED
TO
LUNCH
AT
A
SHOP
IN
THE
STRAND
SO
AS
TO
SET
THAT
OTHER
PIECE
OF
MECHANISM
HER
BODY
INTO
ACTION
WITH
A
BRAIN
WORKING
AND
A
BODY
WORKING
ONE
COULD
KEEP
STEP
WITH
THE
CROWD
AND
NEVER
BE
FOUND
OUT
FOR
THE
HOLLOW
MACHINE
LACKING
THE
ESSENTIAL
THING
THAT
ONE
WAS
CONSCIOUS
OF
BEING
SHE
CONSIDERED
HER
CASE
AS
SHE
WALKED
DOWN
THE
CHARING
CROSS
ROAD
SHE
PUT
TO
HERSELF
A
SERIES
OF
QUESTIONS
WOULD
SHE
MIND
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
THE
WHEELS
OF
THAT
MOTOR-OMNIBUS
PASSED
OVER
HER
AND
CRUSHED
HER
TO
DEATH
NO
NOT
IN
THE
LEAST
OR
AN
ADVENTURE
WITH
THAT
DISAGREEABLE-LOOKING
MAN
HANGING
ABOUT
THE
ENTRANCE
OF
THE
TUBE
STATION
NO
SHE
COULD
NOT
CONCEIVE
FEAR
OR
EXCITEMENT
DID
SUFFERING
IN
ANY
FORM
APPAL
HER
NO
SUFFERING
WAS
NEITHER
GOOD
NOR
BAD
AND
THIS
ESSENTIAL
THING
IN
THE
EYES
OF
EVERY
SINGLE
PERSON
SHE
DETECTED
A
FLAME
AS
IF
A
SPARK
IN
THE
BRAIN
IGNITED
SPONTANEOUSLY
AT
CONTACT
WITH
THE
THINGS
THEY
MET
AND
DROVE
THEM
ON
THE
YOUNG
WOMEN
LOOKING
INTO
THE
MILLINERS
WINDOWS
HAD
THAT
LOOK
IN
THEIR
EYES
AND
ELDERLY
MEN
TURNING
OVER
BOOKS
IN
THE
SECOND-HAND
BOOKSHOPS
AND
EAGERLY
WAITING
TO
HEAR
WHAT
THE
PRICE
WAS
THE
VERY
LOWEST
PRICE
THEY
HAD
IT
TOO
BUT
SHE
CARED
NOTHING
AT
ALL
FOR
CLOTHES
OR
FOR
MONEY
EITHER
BOOKS
SHE
SHRANK
FROM
FOR
THEY
WERE
CONNECTED
TOO
CLOSELY
WITH
RALPH
SHE
KEPT
ON
HER
WAY
RESOLUTELY
THROUGH
THE
CROWD
OF
PEOPLE
AMONG
WHOM
SHE
WAS
SO
MUCH
OF
AN
ALIEN
FEELING
THEM
CLEAVE
AND
GIVE
WAY
BEFORE
HER
STRANGE
THOUGHTS
ARE
BRED
IN
PASSING
THROUGH
CROWDED
STREETS
SHOULD
THE

BY
CHANCE
HAVE
NO
EXACT
DESTINATION
IN

OF
HIM
MUCH
AS
THE
MIND
SHAPES
ALL
KINDS
OF

WHEN
LISTENING
INATTENTIVELY
TO
MUSIC
FROM
AN
ACUTE
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
HERSELF
AS
AN
INDIVIDUAL
MARY
PASSED
TO
A
CONCEPTION
OF
THE
SCHEME
OF
THINGS
IN
WHICH
AS
A
HUMAN
BEING
SHE
MUST
HAVE
HER
SHARE
SHE
HALF
HELD
A
VISION
THE
VISION
SHAPED
AND
DWINDLED
SHE
WISHED
SHE
HAD
A
PENCIL
AND
A
PIECE
OF
PAPER
TO
HELP
HER
TO
GIVE
A
FORM
TO
THIS
CONCEPTION
WHICH
COMPOSED
ITSELF
AS
SHE
WALKED
DOWN
THE
CHARING
CROSS
ROAD
BUT
IF
SHE
TALKED
TO
ANY
ONE
THE
CONCEPTION
MIGHT
ESCAPE
HER
HER
VISION
SEEMED
TO
LAY
OUT
THE
LINES
OF
HER
LIFE
UNTIL
DEATH
IN
A
WAY
WHICH
SATISFIED
HER
SENSE
OF
HARMONY
IT
ONLY
NEEDED
A
PERSISTENT
EFFORT
OF
THOUGHT
STIMULATED
IN
THIS
STRANGE
WAY
BY
THE
CROWD
AND
THE
NOISE
TO
CLIMB
THE
CREST
OF
EXISTENCE
AND
SEE
IT
ALL
LAID
OUT
ONCE
AND
FOR
EVER
ALREADY
HER
SUFFERING
AS
AN
INDIVIDUAL
WAS
LEFT
BEHIND
HER
OF
THIS
PROCESS
WHICH
WAS
TO
HER
SO
FULL
OF
EFFORT
WHICH
COMPRISED
INFINITELY
SWIFT
AND
FULL
PASSAGES
OF
THOUGHT
LEADING
FROM
ONE
CREST
TO
ANOTHER
AS
SHE
SHAPED
HER
CONCEPTION
OF

IN

ONLY

ESCAPED

Now
is
this
any
way
to
interpret
the
world
Seems
there's
a
major
rumble
brewing
in
Poland
Solidarity
is
giving
Moscow
the
V-signs
and
fight-intros
Russia
will
beat
Poland
up
I'm
sure
if
things
go
on
this
way
That's
what
I'd
do
I
mean
give
them
an
inch
The
speculation
about
Lady
Diana's
trousseau
continues
I
have
no
strong
views
on
the
trousseau
but
I
wish
they'd
show
that
famous
snap
again
the
one
where
she's
holding
the
kid
in
her
arms
and
you
can
see
right
through
her
dress
A
barmaid
who
cudgelled
her
landlord
boyfriend
to
death
with
a
beer
flagon
has
been
sentenced
to
eighteen
months
imprisonment
suspended
How
come
Because
she
pleaded
Pre-Menstrual
Tension
I'd
have
thought
that
PMT
was
enough
of
a
male
hazard
anyway
without
that
kind
of
mollycoddling
Another
granny
has
been
mob-raped
in
her
sock
by
black
boys
and
skinheads
What
is
the

craze
for
grannies
This

Getting
raped
at

another
piece
about
that
chick
who's
dying
in
her

according

Poor

Well
I

too

I

We

I
queued
checked

I
got
frisked
X-rayed

I
hit
the

plundered
duty-free
walked
the
chutes
paced
the
waiting
room
until
we
entered
the
ship
two
by
two
all
types
represented
to
make
our
getaway
Aboard
the
travel
tube
a
new
kind
of
waiting
room
we
sat
in
lines
like
an
audience
to
check
out
the
art
therapy
on
offer
toothache
muzak
and
adorning
the
canvas
curtain
of
the

a

from

bracingly

brush
Next
the
death-defying
act
from
the
stewardesses
those
bashful
girls
and
their
oxygen
mine
But
the
stalls
gave
the
bird
to
this
dance
of
doom
Unhooked
from
London
we
boiled
and
shuddered
and
raced
Away!
I
thought
as
we
climbed
through
the
air
with
the
greatest
of
ease
I
looked
down
at
the
pretty
patterns
that
streets
don't
know
they
make
Me
I
was
flying
economy
but
the
plane
churning
sideways
now
was
guzzling
gas
at
seven
gallons
a
mile
Even
the
Fiasco
is
more
economical
than
that
I
was
flying
economy
but
I
too
needed
my
fuel
With
cigarette
and
lighter
cocked
I
awaited
the
release
of
NO

Twisting
my
neck
I
monitored
the
funereal
approach
of
the
drinks
trolley
I
wolfed
down
my
lunch
charming
a
second
helping
out
of
the
all-smiles
stewardess
I
love
airline
food
and
further
suspect
that
there's
money
in
it
somewhere
I
once
tried
to
interest
Terry
Linex
in
the
idea
of
opening
an
airfood
restaurant
Obviously
you'd
need
proper
seats
trays
mayonnaise
sachets
and
so
on
You
could
even
have
video
films
semi-darkness
no-smoking
sections
paper
bags
Linex
liked
the
way
I
was
thinking
but
he
said
that

get
the
punters
in
and
out
quickly
enough
The
food
would
never
be
fast
enough
to
make
really
fast
money
Using
the
costly
head-pincers
I
watched
the
in-flight
movie
The
movie
was
a
wreck
of
course
The
movie
was
a
flapping
squawking
gobbling
turkey
I
hope
my
movie
is
better
than
that
I
certainly
hope
it
makes
more
money
An
airline
sale
within
three
months
of
release
This
has
to
be
a
tragedy
for
everyone
involved
You
know
the
thing
I
want
more
than
anything
else
you
could
call
it
my
dream
in
life
is
to
make
lots
of
money
I
would
cheerfully
go
into
the
alchemy
business
if
it
existed
and
made
lots
of
money
We
travelled
on
through
air
and
time
Still
four
hours
to
kill
Drinking
and
smoking
alas
do
not
claim
one's
undivided
attention
That's
the
only
fault
I
have
to
find
with
these
activities
Some
people
it
seems
to
me
are
never
satisfied
Not
content
with
her
smart
new
chequebook
Selina
now
wants
a
Vantage
card
Oh
yeah
and
a
baby
A
baby
I
looked
around
the
quarter-empty
aircraft
Everyone
appeared
to
be
sleeping
or
reading
I
suppose
reading
must
come
in
quite
handy
at
times
like
these
The
tousled
girl
in
front
of
me
she
was
reading
a
buxom
magazine
its
text
was
in
French
I
think
but
even
I
could
tell
that
the
article
she
scanned
was
about
fellatio
technique
blowjob
knowhow
The
fur
coat
on
the
seat
beside
her
was
uncontrollably
voluminous
like
a
distending
liferaft
She
was
flying
to
her
man
or
maybe
she
was
flying
away
from
him
to
another
one
The
intent
bespectacled
young
lady
to
my
left
in
contrast
was
reading
a
book
called
Rousseau's
Philosophy
This
gave
me
a
neat
opening
I
fetched
another
fistful
of
miniatures
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
flight
telling
her
about
my
philosophy
It
was
tough
but
we
got
through
the
time
somehow
I
have
travelled
widely
said
Fielding
Goodney
in
the
world
of
pornography
Always
endeavour
Slick
to
keep
a
fix
on
the
addiction
industries
you
can't
lose
The
addicts
can't
win
Dope
liquor
gambling
anything
video
these
have
to
be
the
deep-money
veins
Nowadays
the
responsible
businessman
keeps
a
finger
on
the
pulse
of
dependence
What
next
All
projections
are
targeting
the
low-energy
domestic
stuff
the
schlep
factor
People
just
can't
hack
going
out
any
more
They're
all
addicted
to
staying
at
home
Hence
the
shit-food
bonanza
Swallow
your
chemicals
swallow
them
fast
and
get
back
inside
Or
take
the
junk
back
with
you
Stay
off
the
streets
Stay
inside
With
pornography
Yes
I
said
I
sipped
my
crimson
drink
I
lit
another
cigarette
We
were
in
an
Italian
restaurant
well
south
of
SoHo
Tribeca
somewhere
Fielding
said
it
was
a
mob
joint
and
I
believed
him
brocade
matt
light
as
quiet
as
a
church
I
am
a
standard
no-frills
Earthling
but
Goodney
in
his
white
suit
suntan
and
sliding
blond
hair
stood
out
like
a
pink
elephant
among
the
sin-sick
funeral
directors
lurking
and
cruising
against
the
blood-coloured
walls
These
guys
they
seemed
to
talk
without
moving
their
legs
Just
then
a
middle-aged
blow-dried
villain
the
usual
opera-star
face
woozy
with
loot
and
mother-love
urged
a
neon
redhead
past
our
table
our
good
table
to
which
Fielding
had
been
instantly
and
officiously
steered
Fielding
looked
up
He
paused
Antonio
Pisello
he
said
Tony
Cazzo
from
Staten
Island
He
was
shot
in
the
heart
five
years
ago
Know
what
saved
him
he
asked
and
jabbed
his
own
ribs
with
a
long
straight
thumb
Credit
cards
kept
in
a
deck
with
a
band
Used
to
be
a
bad
boy
but
now
he's
pretty
well
totally
legit
And
the
girl
Willa
Glueck
Smart
lady
A
grand-a-nighter
hooker
semi-retired
For
ten
years
she
worked
the
streets
you
know
giving
head
and
hand
at
a
dollar
a
dick
Then
five
years
at
the
top
the
very
top
No
one
knows
how
she
made
the
switch
It
just
doesn't
happen
Look
at
her
the
eyes
the
mouth
superb
No
evidence
I
can't
figure
it
I
hate
it
when
I
can't
figure
things
Indeed
lamentably
under-informed
Fielding
Goodney
He
smiled
in
innocent
self-reproach
then
swung
sternly
and
made
the
reverse
V-sign
at
the
watchful
waiter
Two
more
Red
Snappers
were
on
their
way
We
ordered
Fielding
held
the
crimson
menu
silken
tasselled
and
beautified
reminding
me
and
my
fingers
of
Selina
and
her
secrets
in
slender
brown
hands
the
wrists
cuffed
in
pale
blue
and
the
gold
links
taut
on
their
chains
Over
dinner
Fielding
explained
to
me
about
the
lucrative
contingencies
of
pornography
the
pandemonium
of
Forty-Second
Street
the
Boylesk
dealerships
on
Seventh
Avenue
with
their
prodigies
of
chickens
and
chains
the
Malibu
circuit
with
the
crews
splashing
through
the
set
at
dusk
for
the
last
degrees
of
heft
and
twang
and
purchase
from
the
beached
male
lead
on
the
motel
floor
the
soft
proliferations
of
soft
core
in
worldwide
cable
and
network
and
its
careful
codes
of
airbrush
and
dick-wipe
the
stupendous
aberrations
of
Germany
and
Japan
the
perversion-targeting
in
video
mail-order
the
mob
snuff-movie
operation
conceived
in
Mexico
City
and
dying
in
the
Five
Boroughs
And
I
asked
him
These
movies
they
exist
Sure
But
not
many
not
for
long
and
not
any
more
Fielding
I
noticed
cut
his
veal
in
the
normal
way
but
then
passed
his
fork
to
the
right
hand
to
prong
the
meat
Come
on
Slick
be
realistic
If
there
was
money
there
it
had
to
be
tried
The
girls
were
vagrants
Ever
seen
one
You
understand
what
you're
asking
me
You're
asking
me
if
I'm
an
accessory
after
the
fact
to
first-degree
murder
Not
me
Slick
This
was
organized
crime
superorganized
No
other
way
Snuff
movies
now
this
is
evidence
And
then
his
manner
the
force
field
he
gave
off
it
changed
not
for
long
He
became
pointed
intimate
He
said
Clinching
no
Evidence
that
it
corrupts
pornography
wouldn't
you
say
He
relaxed
and
so
did
his
manner
Too
hot
Slick
No
one
could
use
them
A
distribution
problem
We
went
on
to
discuss
our
distribution
problem
which
according
to
my
pal
Fielding
was
absolutely
non-existent
We
would
simply
lease
out
the
finished
product
that
way
said
Fielding
we
preserved
our
artistic
freedom
while
making
much
much
more
money
I
thought
only
the
big
boys
could
pull
off
a
gimmick
like
this
but
the
kid
had
it
all
worked
out
His
contacts
were
extraordinary
and
not
just
in
movies
either
As
he
talked
and
as
I
hunkered
down
to
a
long
train
of
grappa
and
espresso
I
felt
the
clasp
and
nuzzle
of
real
money
Money
my
bodyguard
You
know
Slick
he
said
sometimes
business
looks
to
me
like
a
big
dumb
dog
howling
to
be
played
with
Want
to
know
my
hunch
for
the
next
growth
area
in
the
addiction
line
Want
to
make
a
million
Shall
I
let
you
in
Do
it
I
said
Cuddles
said
Fielding
Goodney
Cuddling
up
Two
people
lying
down
and
generating
warmth
and
safety
Now
how
do
we
market
this
A
how-to
book
A
video
Nightshirts
A
cuddle
studio
with
cuddle
hostesses
Think
about
it
Slick
There
are
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
out
there
somewhere
in
cuddles
Fielding
caught
the
unspectacular
tab
leaving
a
twenty
on
the
plate
His
hired
Autocrat
was
waiting
on
the
street
At
one
point
Fielding
turned
to
me
and
said
with
midtown
flashing
against
his
face
Oh
I
misled
you
Slick
earlier
on
there
It's
murder
two
not
murder
one
New
York
murder
one
is
just
for
cops
prison
officers
shit
like
that
Forgive
me
I
slipped
out
near
Times
Square
I
heard
Fielding
give
the
driver
an
address
on
feminine
Park
Avenue
I
walked
unsteadily
through
the
heat
of
the
pornographic
night
As
for
my
own
body-clock
readings
and
time-travel
coordinates
well
it
was
a.m
in
here
and
fuming
with
booze
I
had
travelled
far
that
day
through
space
and
through
time
Man
how
I
needed
to
crash
Among
the
alleys
and
rooftops
near
the
Ashbery
Fielding
tells
me
a
nimble
maniac
sprints
and
climbs
at
large
What
he
needs
to
do
is
drop
slating
and
masonry
on
to
the
heads
of
strolling
theatre-goers
and
diners
He
has
done
it
five
times
now
He
has
had
five
hits
One
was
fatal
Murder
two
Ultraviolet
policemen
lie
in
wait
up
there
but
they
can't
seem
to
catch
him
this
rooftop
psychopath
adept
of
eave
and
sill
of
buttress
and
skyhatch
this
infinite-mass
artist
So
he
darts
and
shinnies
his
way
through
the
gothic
jaggedness
of
fire-escapes
drainpipes
and
TV
aerials
while
beneath
him
Broadway
crackles
in
late-night
styrofoam
and
there
is
no
money
involved
There
is
no
money
for
him
up
there
at
any
point
Date

October
th
It's
the
seventh
night
I
keep
on
thinking
the
same
thing
If
only
they
knew
If
only
they
knew
Share
the
outrage
So
now
I'm
trying
to
tell
it
to
this
pad
he
bought
me
this
morning
His
kindness
Calmly
Deep
down
I
get
more
and
more
frightened
It's
only
surface
calm
No
nastiness
no
sex
thing
But
his
eyes
are
mad
Grey
with
a
grey
lost
light
in
them
To
begin
with
I
watched
him
all
the
time
I
thought
it
must
be
sex
if
I
turned
my
back
I
did
it
where
he
couldn't
spring
at
me
and
I
listened
I
had
to
know
exactly
where
he
was
in
the
room
Power
It's
become
so
real
I
know
the
H-bomb
is
wrong
But
being
so
weak
seems
wrong
now
too
I
wish
I
knew
judo
Could
make
him
cry
for
mercy
This
crypt-room
is
so
stuffy
the
walls
squeeze
in
I'm
listening
for
him
as
I
write
the
thoughts
I
have
are
like
bad
drawings
Must
be
torn
up
at
once
Try
try
try
to
escape
It's
all
I
think
of
A
strange
thing
He
fascinates
me
I
feel
the
deepest
contempt
and
loathing
for
him
I
can't
stand
this
room
everybody
will
be
wild
with
worry
I
can
sense
their
wild
worry
How
can
he
love
me
How
can
you
love
someone
you
don't
know
He
wants
desperately
to
please
me
But
that's
what
madmen
must
be
like
They
aren't
deliberately
mad
they
must
be
as
shocked
in
a
way
as
everyone
else
when
they
finally
do
something
terrible
It's
only
this
last
day
or
two
I
could
speak
about
him
so
All
the
way
down
here
in
the
van
it
was
a
nightmare
Wanting
to
be
sick
and
afraid
of
choking
under
the
gag
And
then
being
sick
Thinking
I
was
going
to
be
pulled
into
some
thicket
and
raped
and
murdered
I
was
sure
that
was
it
when
the
van
stopped
I
think
that
was
why
I
was
sick
Not
just
the
beastly
chloroform
I
kept
on
remembering
Penny
Lester's
grisly
dormitory
stories
about
how
her
mother
survived
being
raped
by
the
Japanese
I
kept
on
saying
don't
resist
don't
resist
And
then
someone
else
at
Ladymont
once
said
that
it
takes
two
men
to
rape
you
Women
who
let
themselves
be
raped
by
one
man
want
to
be
raped
I
know
now
that
wouldn't
be
his
way
He'd
use
chloroform
again
or
something
But
that
first
night
it
was
don't
resist
don't
resist
I
was
grateful
to
be
alive
I
am
a
terrible
coward
I
don't
want
to
die
I
love
life
so
passionately
I
never
knew
how
much
I
wanted
to
live
before
If
I
get
out
of
this
I
shall
never
be
the
same
I
don't
care
what
he
does
So
long
as
I
live
It's
all
the
vile
unspeakable
things
he
could
do
I've
looked
everywhere
for
a
weapon
but
there's
nothing
of
any
use
even
if
I
had
the
strength
and
skill
I
prop
a
chair
against
the
iron
door
every
night
so
that
at
least
I
shall
know
if
he
tries
to
get
in
without
my
hearing
Hateful
primitive
wash-stand
and
place
The
great
blank
door
No
keyhole
Nothing
The
silence
I've
got
a
little
more
used
to
it
now
But
it
is
terrible
Never
the
least
sound
It
makes
me
feel
I'm
always
waiting
Alive
Alive
in
the
way
that
death
is
alive
The
collection
of
books
on
art
Nearly
fifty
pounds
worth
I've
added
them
up
That
first
night
it
suddenly
dawned
on
me
that
they
were
there
for
me
That
I
wasn't
a
haphazard
victim
after
all
Then
there
were
the
drawers
full
of
clothes
shirts
skirts
dresses
coloured
stockings
an
extraordinary
selection
of
weekend-in-Paris
underwear
night-dresses
I
could
see
they
were
about
my
size
They're
too
large
but
he
says
he's
seen
me
wear
the
colours
Everything
in
my
life
seemed
fine
There
was
G.P
But
even
that
was
strange
Exciting
Exciting
Then
this
I
slept
a
little
with
the
light
on
on
top
of
the
bed
I
would
have
loved
a
drink
but
I
thought
it
might
be
drugged
I
still
half
expect
the
food
to
be
doped
Seven
days
ago
It
seems
like
seven
weeks
He
looked
so
innocent
and
worried
when
he
stopped
me
He
said
he'd
run
over
a
dog
I
thought
it
might
be
Misty
Exactly
the
sort
of
man
you
would
not
suspect
The
most
unwolf
like
Like
falling
off
the
edge
of
the
world
There
suddenly
being
an
edge
Every
night
I
do
something
I
haven't
done
for
years
I
lie
and
pray
I
don't
kneel
I
know
God
despises
kneelers
I
lie
and
ask
him
to
comfort
M
and
D
and
Minny
and
Caroline
who
must
feel
so
guilty
and
everyone
else
even
the
ones
it
would
do
good
to
suffer
for
me
or
for
anyone
else
Like
Piers
and
Antoinette
I
ask
him
to
help
this
misery
who
has
me
under
his
power
I
ask
him
to
help
me
Not
to
let
me
be
raped
or
abused
and
murdered
I
ask
him
for
light
Literally
Daylight
I
can't
stand
the
absolute
darkness
He's
bought
me
nightlights
I
go
to
sleep
with
one
glowing
beside
me
now
Before
that
I
left
the
light
on
Waking
up
is
the
worst
thing
I
wake
up
and
for
a
moment
I
think
I'm
at
home
or
at
Caroline's
Then
it
hits
me
I
don't
know
if
I
believe
in
God
I
prayed
to
him
furiously
in
the
van
when
I
thought
I
was
going
to
die
that's
a
proof
against
I
can
hear
G.P
saying
But
praying
makes
things
easier
It's
all
bits
and
pieces
I
can't
concentrate
I've
thought
so
many
things
and
now
I
can't
think
of
one
But
it
makes
me
feel
calmer
The
illusion
anyway
Like
working
out
how
much
money
one's
spent
And
how
much
is
left
October
th
He
has
never
had
any
parents
he's
been
brought
up
by
an
aunt
I
can
see
her
A
thin
woman
with
a
white
face
and
a
nasty
tight
mouth
and
mean
grey
eyes
and
dowdy
beige
tea-cosy
hats
and
a
thing
about
dirt
and
dust
Dirt
and
dust
being
everything
outside
her
foul
little
back-street
world
I
told
him
he
was
looking
for
the
mother
he'd
never
had
but
of
course
he
wouldn't
listen
He
doesn't
believe
in
God
That
makes
me
want
to
believe
I
talked
about
me
About
D
and
M
in
a
bright
little
matter-of-fact
voice
He
knew
about
M
I
suppose
the
whole
town
knows
My
theory
is
that
I
have
to
unmartyr
him
The
time
in
prison
Endless
time
The
first
morning
He
knocked
on
the
door
and
waited
ten
minutes
as
he
always
does
It
wasn't
a
nice
ten
minutes
all
the
consoling
thoughts
I'd
scraped
together
during
the
night
ran
away
and
I
was
left
alone
I
stood
there
and
said
if
he
does
don't
resist
don't
resist
I
was
going
to
say
do
what
you
like
but
don't
kill
me
Don't
kill
me
you
can
do
it
again
As
if
I
was
washable
Hard-wearing
It
was
all
different
When
he
came
in
he
just
stood
there
looking
gawky
and
then
at
once
seeing
him
without
a
hat
on
I
knew
who
he
was
I
suppose
I
memorize
people's
features
without
thinking
I
knew
he
was
the
clerk
from
the
Town
Hall
Annexe
The
fabulous
pools
win
His
photo
in
the
paper
We
all
said
we'd
seen
him
about
He
tried
to
deny
it
but
he
went
red
He
blushes
at
everything
Simple
as
sneezing
to
put
him
on
the
defensive
His
face
has
a
sort
of
natural
hurt
set
Sheepish
No
giraffish
Like
a
lanky
gawky
giraffe
I
kept
on
popping
questions
he
wouldn't
answer
all
he
could
do
was
look
as
if
I
had
no
right
to
ask
As
if
this
wasn't
at
all
what
he'd
bargained
for
He's
never
had
anything
to
do
with
girls
With
girls
like
me
anyway
A
lilywhite
boy
He's
six
feet
Eight
or
nine
inches
more
than
me
Skinny
so
he
looks
taller
than
he
is
Gangly
Hands
too
big
a
nasty
fleshy
white
and
pink
Not
a
man's
hands
Adam's
apple
too
big
wrists
too
big
chin
much
too
big
underlip
bitten
in
edges
of
nostrils
red
Adenoids
He's
got
one
of
those
funny
inbetween
voices
uneducated
trying
to
be
educated
It
keeps
on
letting
him
down
His
whole
face
is
too
long
Dull
black
hair
It
waves
and
recedes
it's
coarse
Stiff
Always
in
place
He
always
wears
a
sports
coat
and
flannels
and
a
pinned
tie
Even
cuff-links
He's
what
people
call
a
nice
young
man
Absolutely
sexless
he
looks
He
has
a
way
of
standing
with
his
hands
by
his
side
or
behind
his
back
as
if
he
doesn't
know
what
on
earth
to
do
with
them
Respectfully
waiting
for
me
to
give
my
orders
Fish-eyes
They
watch
That's
all
No
expression
He
makes
me
feel
capricious
Like
a
dissatisfied
rich
customer
he's
a
male
assistant
in
a
draper's
It's
his
line
The
mock-humble
Ever-so-sorry
I
sit
and
eat
my
meals
and
read
a
book
and
he
watches
me
If
I
tell
him
to
go
he
goes
He's
been
secretly
watching
me
for
nearly
two
years
He
loves
me
desperately
he
was
very
lonely
he
knew
I
would
always
be
above
him
It
was
awful
he
spoke
so
awkwardly
he
always
has
to
say
things
in
a
roundabout
way
he
always
has
to
justify
himself
at
the
same
time
I
sat
and
listened
I
couldn't
look
at
him
It
was
his
heart
Sicked
up
all
over
the
hideous
tangerine
carpet
We
just
sat
there
when
he
had
finished
When
he
got
up
to
go
I
tried
to
tell
him
that
I
understood
that
I
wouldn't
say
anything
if
he
would
take
me
home
but
he
backed
away
out
I
tried
to
look
very
understanding
very
sympathetic
but
it
seemed
to
frighten
him
The
next
morning
I
tried
again
I
found
out
what
his
name
was
vile
coincidence!
I
was
very
reasonable
I
looked
up
at
him
and
appealed
but
once
again
it
just
frightened
him
At
lunch
I
told
him
I
could
see
he
was
ashamed
of
what
he
was
doing
and
that
it
wasn't
too
late
You
hit
his
conscience
and
it
gives
but
it
doesn't
hurt
him
at
all
I
am
ashamed
he
says
I
know
I
ought
he
says
I
told
him
he
didn't
look
a
wicked
person
He
said
this
is
the
first
wicked
thing
I've
ever
done
It
probably
is
But
he's
been
saving
up
Sometimes
I
think
he's
being
very
clever
He's
trying
to
enlist
my
sympathy
by
pretending
he's
in
the
grip
of
some
third
thing
That
night
I
tried
not
being
decent
being
sharp
and
bitchy
instead
He
just
looked
more
hurt
than
ever
He's
very
clever
at
looking
hurt
Putting
the
tentacles
of
his
being
hurt
around
me
His
not
being
my
class
I
know
what
I
am
to
him
A
butterfly
he
has
always
wanted
to
catch
I
remember
the
very
first
time
I
met
him
G.P
saying
that
collectors
were
the
worst
animals
of
all
He
meant
art
collectors
of
course
I
didn't
really
understand
I
thought
he
was
just
trying
to
shock
Caroline
and
me
But
of
course
he
is
right
They're
anti-life
anti-art
anti-everything
I
write
in
this
terrible
nightlike
silence
as
if
I
feel
normal
But
I'm
not
I'm
so
sick
so
frightened
so
alone
The
solitude
is
unbearable
Every
time
the
door
opens
I
want
to
rush
at
it
and
out
But
I
know
now
I
must
save
up
my
escape
attempts
Outwit
him
Plan
ahead
Survive

Let
me
describe
to
you
The
Hospice
m.d.J
for
I
don't
believe
you
ever
saw
it
It's
a
longish
lowish
sort
of
house
that
stands
at
the
end
of
a
wooded
track
in
the
deep
part
of
the
Common
It
was
once
called
Caesar's
Farm
because
it's
supposed
to
have
been
built
on
the
site
of
a
Roman
encampment
A
fairly
romantic
notion
but
who
knows
The
nuns
thought
very
little
of
it
and
changed
the
name
to
The
Hospice
of
St
Julian
Julian
for
Julius
and
there
St
Julian
hangs
in
the
hall
above
Mother
Ambrosine's
desk
the
holy
lad
with
the
golden
eyes
St
Julian
the
Hospitaler
St
Julian
the
patron
saint
of
watermen
and
minstrels
the
saint
of
the
passing
show
of
the
Fair
The
saint
who
put
a
leper
in
his
own
bed
and
was
told
by
an
angel
to
cheer
up
and
be
happy
in
married
love
Oh
he's
the
man
for
me
Barry
thinks
he
looks
a
sulky
sort
of
cove
Like
a
sullen
cream
bun
he
says
But
I
gasp
at
his
beauty
Piero
della
Francesca
The
great
eyes
don't
follow
you
about
the
room
They
never
look
at
you
but
out
of
the
window
over
the
Common
and
away
Away
to
the
waters
of
the
Common
and
the
Fair
the
Fair
the
Fair
Well
of
course
the
Common's
why
we
all
came
to
live
here
isn't
it
Our
Common
love
ha
ha
From
the
big
roads
that
slash
it
on
the
London
side
you
wouldn't
think
anything
of
it
just
a
round
field
with
some
grand
houses
standing
looking
at
it
and
a
pond
in
the
middle
where
we
all
skate
in
winter
and
fly
kites
and
sail
boats
the
rest
of
the
year
Vigorous
men
in
shorts
bounce
up
and
down
on
Sunday
afternoons
before
galloping
off
on
long-distance
runs
and
there's
usually
a
horse
or
two
with
well-mannered
people
on
board
touching
their
old
fashioned
black
riding-hats
with
their
crops
There
are
always
dozens
of
dog
walkers
mostly
women
on
their
own
calling
out
Artnoon
to
each
other
There's
the
little
antique
shop
where
you
can
pass
the
time
of
day
and
there's
a
row
of
wisteria-strangled
pastel
cottages
fine
furniture
showing
through
double-locked
windows
burglar
alarms
set
at
the
ready
There's
the
seventeenth-century
farm-house
that's
supposed
to
be
stuffed
with
Rembrandts
and
there's
the
pair
of
thirty-foot
wrought
iron
gates
a
coach
and
horses
rattles
through
each
night
at
eight
o'clock
though
I've
never
seen
it
The
gates
lead
to
a
new
close
of
houses
with
pink
and
peppermint
courtyard
tiles
The
coach
stops
on
the
tiles
before
a
house
that
hasn't
been
there
for
two
hundred
years
Ha
But
duckie-doo
dear
Joanio
beyond
the
pond
and
the
patios
and
the
golfers
in
their
yellow
jerseys
like
wandering
bananas
the
wild
part
of
the
Common
begins
Remember
the
sweep
of
bracken
nearly
half
a
mile
of
it
Did
you
know
that
a
French
duchess
used
to
produce
plays
in
a
glade
in
the
middle
of
it
Pastoral
parties
for
the
French
emigres
Marie
Antoinette
shepherdesses
wandered
down
the
rabbit-paths
in
silken
pinnies
carrying
ivory
crooks
down
to
the
green
scythed
stage
The
leathery
fish-bone
bracken
nearly
met
over
their
heads
Tinkling
laughter
lemonade
sugared
cakes
footmen
in
wigs
French
farce
Deep
sleepy
country
then
silent
as
Shropshire
Now
even
louder
than
when
you
left
Joan
you
can
hear
the
traffic
You
can
hear
it
anywhere
on
the
Common
now
tearing
east
and
west
across
the
London
counties
comforting
as
ships
engines
thundering
along
We
pay
more
for
living
near
the
Common
now
and
the
nuns
have
to
pay
more
still
to
let
us
have
the
privilege
of
dying
on
it
But
we
still
love
the
place
for
itself
It's
not
just
the
city-dweller's
snob
gold
card
the
chance
he
has
of
pretending
to
live
in
the
country
I
met
Old
Bernard
once
on
the
Common
cursing
and
swearing
under
his
breath
cracking
his
broken
fingers
the
Auschwitz
number
tattoo
hidden
beneath
his
shirt
cuff
You
all
play
at
being
country
gentlemen
he
shouts
on
bad
days
and
by
Christ
it's
over
But
he
walks
on
the
Common
almost
every
day
and
cycles
slowly
about
on
it
early
in
the
mornings
The
Common
has
a
presence
and
a
spirit
of
its
own
Beyond
the
pond
and
the
coloured
cottages
Joan
remember
how
the
woods
begin
Remember
how
the
ground
drops
down
and
the
trees
rise
and
thicken
Through
the
trees
paths
straggle
turn
and
dip
under
hanging
branches
and
bring
you
out
to
grassy
places
with
butterflies
and
brambles
and
streams
with
bits
of
logs
slung
across
for
bridges
You
can
walk
for
hours
seeing
nobody
but
the
odd
flasher
Or
you
can
walk
through
the
woods
a
mile
or
so
and
out
of
them
again
into
long
avenues
of
park-like
trees
You
probably
never
went
this
far
always
being
so
busy
If
like
me
you
had
lived
here
for
a
long
time
you
could
have
watched
the
trees
grow
and
change
their
nature
flourish
age
droop
recover
fall
They
fell
some
of
them
in
what
looks
like
their
prime
I
knew
a
tree
Joan
a
birch
It
stood
beyond
the
spring
It
never
grew
tall
It
flickered
and
swayed
When
it
was
young
it
tossed
its
hair
I
used
to
wander
about
on
the
Common
then
almost
every
day
watching
the
women
with
the
children
and
the
lonely
unappetising-looking
men
For
the
likes
of
me
they
had
put
a
seat
near
the
trees
On
the
seat
was
a
very
expensive
brass
plate
saying
In
memory
of
James
and
John
the
sons
of
thunder
two
Sealyhams
who
for
many
years
were
happy
on
these
Commons
Classy
that
the
plural
Classy
the
brass
It
got
nicked
like
they
nicked
all
the
brass
lettering
off
the
War
Memorial
Old
Bernard
walks
by
the
seat
cracking
and
crackling
his
tortured
hands
We
are
used
to
him
These
Commons
Where's
the
other
one
the
other
one
the
Common
of
the
golden
boy
the
passing
Fair
Hush
Wait
I
think
we'll
get
there
in
the
end
Now
that
lovely
tree
grew
more
and
more
beautiful
Its
bark
thickened
and
fumed
to
gold
and
pewter
flakes
The
leaves
fumed
first
to
green
and
then
to
white
confetti
from
silver
coins
like
the
sun
on
summer
water
to
October
sovereigns
shaking
against
the
autumn
sky
The
gold
discs
were
scattered
around
in
the
frailest
twigs
on
the
metal
branches
Then
one
day
it
was
gone
I
stood
by
the
seat
Gone
Joan
gone
The
tree
had
gone
There
was
turf
over
the
hole
neat
as
needlework
If
you
scuffed
your
feet
about
you
could
just
make
out
a
few
white
chippings
in
the
long
grass
The
tree
had
had
its
knock
on
the
door
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
Everything
tidied
away
Miss
Ingham
came
by
all
cardigans
and
wraps
and
her
pockets
bulging
with
the
roots
she
pinched
She
said
How
very
upsetting
Someone
had
seen
the
signs
of
mortality
in
the
tree
and
spared
it
a
lingering
death
There
are
still
badgers
on
the
Common
Joan
and
foxes
Do
you
ever
think
of
them
among
the
tigers
and
the
crocs
There
are
better
flowers
than
there
used
to
be
now
that
we
have
all
become
such
a
nice
bright
Green
and
the
cold
spring
still
rises
and
flows
down
through
the
trees
to
feed
the
mere
the
best
water
in
Surrey
says
Marjorie
Gargery
passing
paper
cups
of
it
around
among
her
children
There's
always
someone
standing
in
the
pine
trees
where
the
spring
rises
always
some
old
tramp
with
purple
lips
Often
that
queer
little
jogger
dressed
in
black
You
often
see
him
about
in
that
slinky
track
suit
He
never
looks
at
me
but
he
knows
that
I
am
there
I
sometimes
think
he
might
murder
me
It
would
happen
in
fiction
The
Roman
soldiers
at
the
spring
would
have
made
short
work
of
him
I
think
of
them
dipping
their
feet
in
the
water
and
their
Naafi
mugs
I
think
of
them
shivering
and
wishing
for
Umbria
and
the
land
of
Piero
delta
Francesca
except
he
hadn't
then
been
born
Well
now
this
pure
and
ancient
trickle
Joan
flows
not
so
far
away
from
a
metalled
narrow
road
marked
Private
that
leads
to
The
Hospice
One
mile
and
a
half
and
down
it
one
day
I
come
a
Maying
and
find
Mother
Ambrosine
at
her
books
Good
afternoon
Eliza
You
are
looking
very
wild
I
walked
Maybe
I
took
a
bus
part
of
the
way
Then
I
walked
From
the
other
side
Through
the
woods
You
walked
all
the
way
through
the
woods
My
dear
you've
walked
miles
Miles
I'm
not
an
old
woman
Mother
Ambrosine
But
my
lamb
it
is
pouring
with
rain
It
is
raining
like
the
Monsoon
Mother
Ambrosine
is
solid
and
sure
Her
face
is
smooth
and
brown
Her
eyes
are
brown
and
bright
and
clear
She
looks
completed
It
is
a
face
familiar
to
me
but
never
usual
It
is
a
face
with
which
you
do
not
compete
There
are
lines
about
the
eyes
across
the
brow
one
thread
More
lines
about
the
mouth
But
no
bags
No
pouches
She
travels
without
luggage
Her
ears
have
never
been
pierced
and
her
hair
has
never
seen
an
electric
drier
or
a
scented
shampoo
It's
short
and
springy
beneath
a
little
cap
that
is
the
residual
fin
of
what
for
centuries
in
her
Order
was
a
huge
and
yacht-like
veil
Stout
shoes
beneath
the
desk
support-tights
knees
well
apart
beneath
the
dark
serge
skirt
and
she
is
scratching
under
the
residual
fin
with
a
leaky
biro
Or
was
She
has
stopped
As
I
approach
the
desk
the
biro
is
brought
point
down
and
begins
to
rap
the
blotting
pad
to
the
skin
she
is
saying
At
once
to
the
Laundry
Take
off
those
clothes
I
can't
run
naked
through
The
Hospice
We'll
find
you
something
What
shall
we
do
with
her
Nick
I
see
for
the
first
time
that
the
Curate
is
sitting
in
her
office
Nick
Fish
the
committee
man
my
high-Protestant
priest
He
and
Mother
A
have
been
sitting
talking
together
sitting
quiet
together
Anglican
and
Roman
talking
and
thinking
St
Julian
above
their
heads
stares
on
and
I
examine
my
fingernails
They
have
begun
to
look
unfamiliar
lately
I
fear
Mother
A
and
Nick
Fish
This
silence
between
them
This
stillness
holds
within
it
the
awaited
grief
I
have
seen
Mother
A
of
course
many
times
at
a
death
but
a
Hospice
Joan
is
not
what
they
sometimes
make
out
a
brave
hearty
place
though
it's
no
bleak
house
of
corpses
either
It
was
to
try
to
find
out
something
about
death
that
I
came
here
in
the
first
place
as
I
dare
say
by
now
you
will
have
guessed
Only
domestic
work
it
may
be
but
there
are
few
secrets
in
a
kitchen
We've
all
wept
in
The
Hospice
Joan
We're
not
always
jealously
thinking
of
heaven
Death
they
tell
you
at
funerals
which
are
hellish
things
Joan
and
I
can't
stand
the
people
who
pretend
they're
not
death
is
just
like
stepping
into
another
room
Yeah
who
says
Who's
been
there
And
which
room
Joan
How
are
we
going
to
shape
up
to
turning
the
door-handle
to
find
out
I
have
seen
Mother
Ambrosine
the
warrior
Queen
for
God
distressed
and
shaken
by
death
and
if
it
were
not
so
there
would
be
no
strength
And
now
here's
Fish
the
Committee
in
his
scruffy
cassock
and
woolly
hat
and
gloves
working
away
at
a
rosary
and
making
sure
not
to
look
at
me
So
my
Lord
and
my
God
I
am
right
and
it
is
Barry
He
is
gone
Barry's
been
asking
for
you
says
Mother
A
Quickly
get
dry
and
go
and
see
him
How
is
he
Back
in
bed
Weak
Not
so
bad
Barry
she
says
to
Nick
Fish
is
still
here
He
is
in
love
with
Eliza
I
say
to
Nick
He
is
twenty-two
years
old
Fish
absorbs
this
information
unsmiling
and
twitches
He
can't
stand
me
Upper
class-rich-bitch-never-done-a-day's-work-in-her-life
But
I
watch
him
putting
holy
charity
together
as
he
lets
go
the
rosary
and
gets
to
his
feet
I
see
the
dirty
trainers
and
boyish
draggly
shoe-lace
I
see
the
inside
of
his
head
no
NO
Please
God
no
Don't
let
this
happen
I
will
my
soul
or
whatever
it
is
that
forces
on
me
these
visitations
I
will
my
eyes
not
to
see
the
jelly
within
the
bone
and
the
bone's
soft
marrow
and
the
cells
that
make
our
juices
cells
so
temporal
that
they
flow
away
like
the
foam
on
the
quay
that
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
little
mermaid
in
the
tale
She
faded
downwards
from
the
head
Off
with
her
head
Blink
Swallow
Better
Nick's
taut
face
is
back
and
I
see
the
expression
on
its
surface
and
the
effort
he
is
making
as
a
Christian
priest
dealing
with
poor
dotty
Eliza
But
how
can
he
ever
give
comfort
if
he
can't
conceal
the
clock-work
the
cuckoo
clockwork
going
on
within
his
head
Yet
it's
hard
to
trust
a
mask
and
if
you
arouse
hostile
feelings
maybe
it's
better
to
know
it
even
if
they're
in
a
priest
Cock-a-snook
back
maybe
Cockasnook
His
brain
is
saying
no
don't
look
look
away
Eliza
Peabody
oh
my
God
not
her
again
The
mad
woman
Needs
a
shrink
What's
Mother
Am
doing
letting
her
in
here
Hullo
Eliza
Nice
to
see
you
Sorry
I
had
to
go
the
last
time
we
met
We
must
have
that
talk
some
time

About
my
grandmother
Flory
Zogoiby
Epifania
da
Gama's
opposite
number
her
equal
in
years
although
closer
to
me
by
a
generation
a
decade
before
the
century's
turn
Fearless
Flory
would
haunt
the
boys
school
playground
teasing
adolescent
males
with
swishings
of
skirts
and
sing-song
sneers
and
with
a
twig
would
scratch
challenges
into
the
earth
step
across
this
line
Line-drawing
comes
down
to
me
from
both
sides
of
the
family
She
would
taunt
them
with
nonsensical
terrifying
incantations
making
like
a
witch
Obeah
jadoo
fo
fum
chicken
entrails
kingdom
come
Ju
ju
voodoo
fee
fi
piddle
cocktails
time
to
die
When
the
boys
came
at
her
she
attacked
them
with
a
ferocity
that
easily
overcame
their
theoretical
advantages
of
strength
and
size
Her
gifts
of
war
came
down
to
her
from
some
unknown
ancestor
and
though
her
adversaries
grabbed
her
hair
and
called
her
Jewess
they
never
vanquished
her
Sometimes
she
literally
rubbed
their
noses
in
the
dirt
On
other
occasions
she
stood
back
scrawny
arms
folded
in
triumph
across
her
chest
and
allowed
her
stunned
victims
to
back
unsteadily
away
Next
time
pick
on
someone
your
own
size
Flory
added
insult
to
injury
by
inverting
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
Us
pint-size
jewinas
are
too
hot
for
you
to
handle
Yes
she
was
rubbing
it
in
but
even
this
attempt
to
make
metaphors
of
her
victories
to
represent
herself
as
the
champion
of
the
small
of
the
Minority
of
girls
failed
to
make
her
popular
Fast
Flory
Flory-the-Roary
she
acquired
a
Reputation
The
time
came
when
nobody
would
cross
the
lines
she
went
on
drawing
with
fearsome
precision
across
the
gullies
and
open
spaces
of
her
childhood
years
She
grew
moody
and
inward
and
sat
on
behind
her
dust-lines
besieged
within
her
own
fortifications
By
her
eighteenth
birthday
she
had
stopped
fighting
having
learned
something
about
winning
battles
and
losing
wars
The
point
I'm
leading
up
to
is
that
Christians
had
in
Flory's
view
stolen
more
from
her
than
ancestral
spice
fields
What
they
took
was
even
then
getting
to
be
in
short
supply
and
for
a
girl
with
a
Reputation
the
supply
was
even
shorter
in
her
twenty-fourth
year
Solomon
Castile
the
synagogue
caretaker
had
stepped
across
Miss
Flory's
lines
to
ask
for
her
hand
in
marriage
The
act
was
generally
thought
to
be
one
of
great
charity
or
stupidity
or
both
Even
in
those
days
the
numbers
of
the
community
were
decreasing
Maybe
four
thousand
persons
living
in
the
Mattancherri
Jewtown
and
by
the
time
you
excluded
family
members
and
the
very
young
and
the
very
old
and
the
crazy
and
infirm
the
youngsters
of
marriageable
age
were
not
spoiled
for
choice
of
partners
Old
bachelors
fanned
themselves
by
the
clocktower
and
walked
by
the
harbour's
edge
hand
in
hand
toothless
spinsters
sat
in
doorways
sewing
clothes
for
non-existent
babies
Matrimony
inspired
as
much
spiteful
envy
as
celebration
and
Flory's
marriage
to
the
caretaker
was
attributed
by
gossip
to
the
ugliness
of
both
parties
As
sin
the
sham
tongues
said
Pity
the
kids
my
God
Old
enough
to
be
her
father
Flory
scolded
Abraham
but
Solomon
Castile
born
in
the
year
of
the
Indian
Uprising
had
been
twenty
years
her
senior
poor
man
probably
wanted
to
get
married
while
he
was
still
capable
the
wagging
tongues
surmised
and
there
is
one
more
fact
about
their
wedding
It
took
place
on
the
same
day
in
as
a
much
grander
affair
no
newspapers
recorded
the
Castile-Zogoiby
nuptials
in
their
social-register
columns
but
there
were
many
photographs
of
Mr
Francisco
da
Gama
and
his
smiling
Mangalorean
bride
The
vengefulness
of
the
spouseless
was
finally
satisfied
because
after
seven
years
and
seven
days
of
explosive
wedlock
during
which
Flory
gave
birth
to
one
child
a
boy
who
would
perversely
grow
up
to
be
the
most
handsome
young
man
of
his
dwindling
generation
caretaker
Castile
at
nightfall
on
his
fiftieth
birthday
walked
over
to
the
water's
edge
hopped
into
a
rowing-boat
with
half
a
dozen
drunken
Portuguese
sailors
and
ran
away
to
sea
He
should
have
known
better'n
to
marry
Roary
Flory
according
to
contented
bachelor-spinster
whispers
but
wise
man's
brain
don't
come
automatic
along
with
wise
man's
name
The
broken
marriage
came
to
be
known
in
Mattancherri
as
the
Misjudgment
of
Solomon
but
Flory
blamed
the
Christian
ships
the
mercantile
armada
of
the
omnipotent
west
for
tempting
her
husband
away
in
search
of
golden
streets
And
at
the
age
of
seven
her
son
was
obliged
to
give
up
his
father's
name
unlucky
in
fathers
he
took
his
mother's
unlucky
Zogoiby
for
his
own
After
Solomon's
desertion
Flory
took
over
as
caretaker
of
blue
ceramic
tiles
and
Joseph
Rabban's
copper
plates
claiming
the
post
with
a
gleaming
ferocity
that
silenced
all
rumbles
of
opposition
to
her
appointment
Under
her
protection
not
only
little
Abraham
but
also
the
parchment
Old
Testament
on
whose
ragged-edged
leathery
pages
the
Hebrew
letters
flowed
and
the
hollow
golden
crown
presented
Christian
Era
by
the
Maharaja
of
Travancore
She
instituted
reforms
When
the
faithful
came
to
worship
she
ordered
them
to
remove
their
shoes
Objections
were
raised
to
this
positively
Moorish
practice
Flory
in
response
barked
mirthless
laughs
What
devotion
she
snorted
Caretaking
you
want
from
me
better
you
take
some
care
too
Boots
off!
Chop
chop!
Protectee
Chinee
tiles
No
two
are
identical
The
tiles
from
Canton
X
approx
imported
by
Ezekiel
Rabhi
in
the
year
CE
covered
the
floors
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
little
synagogue
Legends
had
begun
to
stick
to
them
Some
said
that
if
you
explored
for
long
enough
you'd
find
your
own
story
in
one
of
the
blue-and-white
squares
because
the
pictures
on
the
tiles
could
change
were
changing
generation
by
generation
to
tell
the
story
of
the
Cochin
Jews
Still
others
were
convinced
that
the
tiles
were
prophecies
the
keys
to
whose
meanings
had
been
lost
with
the
passing
years
Abraham
as
a
boy
crawled
around
the
synagogue
bum-in-air
with
his
nose
pressed
against
antique
Chinese
blue
He
never
told
his
mother
that
his
father
had
reappeared
in
ceramic
form
on
the
synagogue
floor
a
year
after
he
decamped
in
a
little
blue
rowing-boat
with
blue-skinned
foreign-looking
types
by
his
side
heading
off
towards
an
equally
blue
horizon
After
this
discovery
Abraham
periodically
received
news
of
Solomon
Castile
through
the
good
offices
of
the
metamorphic
tiles
He
next
saw
his
father
in
a
cerulean
scene
of
Dionysiac
willow-pattern
merrymaking
amid
slain
dragons
and
grumbling
volcanoes
Solomon
was
dancing
in
an
open
hexagonal
pavilion
with
a
carefree
joy
upon
his
blue-tile
face
which
utterly
transformed
it
from
the
dolorous
countenance
which
Abraham
remembered
If
he
is
happy
the
boy
thought
then
I'm
glad
he
went
From
his
earliest
days
Abraham
had
instinctive
knowledge
of
the
paramountcy
of
happiness
and
it
was
this
same
instinct
which
years
later
would
allow
the
grown-up
duty
manager
to
seize
the
love
offered
with
many
blushes
and
sarcasms
by
Aurora
da
Gama
in
the
chiaroscuro
of
the
Ernakulam
godown
Over
the
years
Abraham
found
his
father
wealthy
and
fat
in
one
tile
seated
upon
cushions
in
the
Position
of
Royal
Ease
and
waited
upon
by
eunuchs
and
dancing-girls
but
only
a
few
months
later
he
was
skinny
and
mendicant
in
another
twelve-by-twelve
scenario
Now
Abraham
understood
that
the
former
caretaker
had
left
all
restraints
behind
him
and
was
oscillating
wildly
through
a
life
that
had
deliberately
been
allowed
to
go
out
of
control
He
was
a
Sindbad
seeking
his
fortune
in
the
oceanic
happenstance
of
the
earth
He
was
a
heavenly
body
which
had
managed
by
an
act
of
will
to
wrench
itself
free
of
its
fixed
orbit
and
now
wandered
the
galaxies
accepting
whatever
destiny
might
provide
It
seemed
to
Abraham
that
his
father's
breakaway
from
the
gravity
of
the
everyday
had
used
up
all
his
reserves
of
will-power
so
that
after
that
initial
and
radical
act
of
transformation
he
was
brokenruddered
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds
and
tides
As
Abraham
Zogoiby
neared
adolescence
Solomon
Castile
began
to
appear
in
semi-pornographic
tableaux
whose
appropriateness
for
a
synagogue
would
have
been
the
subject
of
much
controversy
had
they
come
to
anyone
else's
notice
but
Abraham's
These
tiles
cropped
up
in
the
dustiest
and
murkiest
recesses
of
the
building
and
Abraham
preserved
them
by
allowing
mould
to
form
and
cobwebs
to
gather
over
their
more
reprehensible
zones
in
which
his
father
disported
himself
with
startling
numbers
of
individuals
of
both
sexes
in
a
fashion
which
his
wide-eyed
son
could
only
think
of
as
educational
And
yet
in
spite
of
the
salacious
gymnastics
of
these
activities
the
ageing
wanderer
had
regained
his
old
lugubriousness
of
mien
so
that
perhaps
all
his
journeys
had
done
no
more
than
wash
him
up
at
the
last
on
the
same
shores
of
discontent
whence
he
had
first
set
forth
On
the
day
Abraham
Zogoiby's
voice
broke
he
was
gripped
by
the
notion
that
his
father
was
about
to
return
He
raced
through
the
alleys
of
the
Jewish
quarter
down
to
the
waterfront
where
cantilevered
Chinese
fishing
nets
were
spread
out
against
the
sky
but
the
fish
he
sought
did
not
leap
out
of
the
waves
When
he
returned
in
despondency
to
the
synagogue
all
the
tiles
depicting
his
father's
odyssey
had
changed
and
showed
scenes
both
anonymous
and
banal
Abraham
in
a
feverish
rage
spent
hours
crawling
across
the
floor
in
search
of
magic
To
no
avail
for
the
second
time
in
his
life
his
unwise
father
Solomon
Castile
had
vanished
into
the
blue
I
no
longer
remember
when
I
first
heard
the
family
story
which
provided
me
with
my
nickname
and
my
mother
with
the
theme
of
her
most
famous
series
of
paintings
the
Moor
sequence
that
reached
its
triumphant
culmination
in
the
unfinished
and
subsequently
stolen
masterpiece
The
Moor's
Last
Sigh
I
seem
to
have
known
it
all
my
life
this
lurid
saga
from
which
I
should
add
Mr
Vasco
Miranda
derived
an
early
work
of
his
own
but
in
spite
of
long
familiarity
I
have
grave
doubts
about
the
literal
truth
of
the
story
with
its
somewhat
overwrought
Bombay-talkie
masala
narrative
its
almost
desperate
reaching
back
for
a
kind
of
authentification
for
evidence
I
believe
and
others
have
since
confirmed
that
simpler
explanations
can
be
offered
for
the
transaction
between
Abraham
Zogoiby
and
his
mother
most
particularly
for
what
he
did
or
did
not
find
in
an
old
trunk
underneath
the
altar
I
will
offer
one
such
alternative
version
by
and
by
For
the
moment
I
present
the
approved
and
polished
family
yarn
which
being
so
profound
a
part
of
my
parents
pictures
of
themselves
and
so
significant
a
part
of
contemporary
Indian
art
history
has
for
those
reasons
if
no
other
a
power
and
importance
I
will
not
attempt
to
deny
We
have
reached
a
key
moment
in
the
tale
Let
us
return
briefly
to
young
Abraham
on
hands
and
knees
frantically
searching
the
synagogue
for
the
father
who
had
just
abandoned
him
again
calling
out
to
him
in
a
cracked
voice
swooping
from
bulbul
to
crow
until
at
length
overcoming
an
unspoken
taboo
he
ventured
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
behind
beneath
the
pale
blue
drape
with
golden
hem
that
graced
the
high
altar
Solomon
Castile
wasn't
there
the
teenager's
flashlight
fell
instead
upon
an
old
box
marked
with
a
Z
and
fastened
with
a
cheap
padlock
which
was
soon
picked
for
schoolboys
have
skills
which
adults
forget
as
surely
as
lessons
learned
by
rote
And
so
despairing
of
his
absconded
father
he
found
his
mother's
secrets
out
instead
What
was
in
the
box
Why
the
only
treasure
of
any
value
viz
the
past
and
the
future
Also
however
emeralds
And
so
to
the
day
of
crisis
when
the
adult
Abraham
Zogoiby
charged
into
the
synagogue
I'll
show
her
Fitz
he
cried
and
dragged
the
trunk
out
from
its
hiding-place
His
mother
pursuing
him
saw
her
secrets
coming
out
into
the
open
and
felt
her
legs
give
way
She
sat
down
on
blue
tiles
with
a
thump
while
Abraham
opened
the
box
and
drew
out
a
silver
dagger
which
he
stuck
in
his
trouser-belt
then
breathing
in
short
gasps
Flory
watched
him
remove
and
place
upon
his
head
an
ancient
tattered
crown
Not
the
nineteenth-century
circlet
of
gold
donated
by
Maharaja
Travancore
but
something
altogether
more
ancient
was
the
way
I
heard
it
A
dark
green
turban
wound
in
cloth
rendered
illusory
by
age
so
delicate
that
even
the
orange
evening
light
filtering
into
the
synagogue
seemed
too
fierce
so
provisional
that
it
might
almost
have
disintegrated
beneath
Flora

Fifty
feet
from
the
perimeter
fence
Jim
lay
in
the
deep
grass
beside
the
pheasant
trap
He
listened
to
the
guards
arguing
with
each
other
as
they
conducted
their
hourly
patrol
of
the
camp
Now
that
the
American
air
attacks
had
become
a
daily
event
the
Japanese
soldiers
no
longer
slung
their
rifles
over
their
shoulders
They
clasped
the
long-barrelled
weapons
in
both
hands
and
were
so
nervous
that
if
they
saw
Jim
outside
the
camp
perimeter
they
would
shoot
at
him
without
thinking
Jim
watched
them
through
the
netting
of
the
pheasant
trap
Only
the
previous
day
they
had
shot
a
Chinese
coolie
trying
to
steal
into
the
camp
He
recognised
one
of
the
guards
as
Private
Kimura
a
large-boned
farmer's
son
who
had
grown
almost
as
much
as
Jim
in
his
years
at
the
camp
The
private's
strong
back
had
burst
through
his
faded
tunic
and
only
his
ammunition
webbing
held
the
tattered
garment
together
Before
the
war
finally
turned
against
the
Japanese
Private
Kimura
often
invited
Jim
to
the
bungalow
he
shared
with
three
other
guards
and
allowed
him
to
wear
his
kendo
armour
Jim
could
remember
the
elaborate
ceremony
as
the
Japanese
soldiers
dressed
him
in
the
metal
and
leather
armour
and
the
ripe
smell
of
Private
Kimura's
body
that
filled
the
helmet
and
shoulder
guards
He
remembered
the
burst
of
violence
as
Private
Kimura
attacked
him
with
the
two-handed
sword
the
whirlwind
of
blows
that
struck
his
helmet
before
he
could
fight
back
His
head
had
rung
for
days
Giving
him
his
orders
Basie
had
been
forced
to
shout
until
he
woke
the
men's
dormitory
in
E
Block
and
Dr
Ransome
had
called
Jim
into
the
camp
hospital
and
examined
his
ears
Remembering
those
powerful
arms
and
the
quickness
of
Private
Kimura's
eyes
Jim
lay
flat
in
the
long
grass
behind
the
trap
For
once
he
was
glad
that
the
trap
had
failed
to
net
a
bird
The
two
Japanese
had
stopped
by
the
wire
fence
and
were
scanning
the
group
of
abandoned
buildings
that
lay
outside
the
north-west
perimeter
of
Lunghua
Camp
Beside
them
just
within
the
camp
was
the
derelict
hulk
of
the
assembly
hall
the
curved
balcony
of
its
upper
circle
open
to
the
sky
The
camp
occupied
the
site
of
a
teacher
training
college
that
had
been
bombed
and
overrun
during
the
fighting
around
Lunghua
Aerodrome
in
The
damaged
buildings
nearest
to
the
airfield
had
been
excluded
from
the
camp
and
it
was
here
in
the
long
grass
quadrangles
between
the
gutted
residence
halls
that
Jim
set
his
pheasant
traps
After
roll-call
that
morning
he
had
slipped
through
the
fence
where
it
emerged
from
a
bank
of
nettles
surrounding
a
forgotten
blockhouse
on
the
airfield
perimeter
Leaving
his
shoes
on
the
blockhouse
steps
he
waded
along
a
shallow
canal
and
then
crawled
through
the
deep
grass
between
the
ruined
buildings
The
first
of
the
traps
was
only
a
few
feet
from
the
perimeter
fence
a
distance
that
had
seemed
enormous
to
Jim
when
he
first
crept
through
the
barbed
wire
He
had
looked
back
at
the
secure
world
of
the
camp
at
the
barrack
huts
and
water
tower
at
the
guardhouse
and
dormitory
blocks
almost
afraid
that
he
had
been
banished
from
them
forever
Dr
Ransome
often
called
Jim
a
free
spirit
as
he
roved
across
the
camp
hunting
down
some
new
idea
in
his
head
But
here
in
the
deep
grass
between
the
ruined
buildings
he
felt
weighed
by
an
unfamiliar
gravity
For
once
making
the
most
of
this
inertia
Jim
lay
behind
the
trap
An
aircraft
was
taking
off
from
Lunghua
Airfield
clearly
silhouetted
against
the
yellow
facades
of
the
apart-
ment
houses
in
the
French
Concession
but
he
ignored
the
plane
The
soldier
beside
Private
Kimura
shouted
to
the
children
playing
in
the
balcony
of
the
assembly
hall
Kimura
was
walking
back
to
the
wire
He
scanned
the
surface
of
the
canal
and
the
clumps
of
wild
sugar
cane
The
poor
rations
of
the
past
year
the
Japanese
guards
were
almost
as
badly
fed
as
their
British
and
American
prisoners
had
drawn
the
last
of
the
adolescent
fat
from
Kimura's
arms
After
a
recent
attack
of
tuberculosis
his
strong
face
was
puffy
and
coolie-like
Dr
Ransome
had
repeatedly
warned
Jim
never
to
wear
Private
Kimura's
kendo
armour
A
fight
between
them
would
be
less
one-sided
now
even
though
Jim
was
only
fourteen
But
for
the
rifle
he
would
have
liked
to
challenge
Kimura
As
if
aware
of
the
threat
within
the
grass
Private
Kimura
called
to
his
companion
He
leaned
his
rifle
against
the
pine
fencing-post
stepped
through
the
wire
and
stood
in
the
deep
nettles
Flies
rose
from
the
shallow
canal
and
settled
on
his
lips
but
Kimura
ignored
them
and
stared
at
the
strip
of
water
that
separated
him
from
Jim
and
the
pheasant
traps
Could
he
see
Jim's
footprints
in
the
soft
mud
Jim
crawled
away
from
the
trap
but
the
clear
outline
of
his
body
lay
in
the
crushed
grass
Kimura
was
rolling
his
tattered
sleeves
ready
to
wrestle
with
his
quarry
Jim
watched
him
stride
through
the
nettles
He
was
certain
that
he
could
outrun
Kimura
but
not
the
bullet
in
the
second
soldier's
rifle
How
could
he
explain
to
Kimura
that
the
pheasant
traps
had
been
Basie's
idea
It
was
Basie
who
had
insisted
on
the
elaborate
camouflage
of
leaves
and
twigs
and
who
made
him
climb
through
the
wire
twice
a
day
even
though
they
had
never
seen
a
bird
let
alone
caught
one
It
was
important
to
keep
in
with
Basie
who
had
small
but
reliable
sources
of
food
He
could
tell
Kimura
that
Basie
knew
about
the
secret
camp
radio
but
then
the
extra
food
would
cease
What
most
worried
Jim
was
the
thought
that
if
Kimura
struck
him
he
would
fight
back
Few
boys
of
his
own
age
dared
to
touch
Jim
and
in
the
last
year
since
the
rations
had
failed
few
men
However
if
he
fought
back
against
Kimura
he
would
be
dead
He
calmed
himself
calculating
the
best
moment
to
stand
up
and
surrender
He
would
bow
to
Kimura
show
no
emotion
and
hope
that
the
hundreds
of
hours
he
had
spent
hanging
around
the
guardhouse
albeit
at
Basie's
instigation
would
count
in
his
favour
He
had
once
given
English
lessons
to
Kimura
but
although
they
were
clearly
losing
the
war
the
Japanese
had
not
been
interested
in
learning
English
Jim
waited
for
Kimura
to
climb
the
bank
towards
him
The
soldier
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
canal
a
bright
black
object
gleaming
in
his
hand
The
creeks
ponds
and
disused
wells
within
Lunghua
Camp
held
an
armoury
of
rusting
weapons
and
unstable
ammunition
abandoned
during
the
hostilities
Jim
peered
through
the
grass
at
the
pointed
cylinder
assuming
that
the
tidal
water
in
the
canal
had
uncovered
an
old
artillery
shell
or
mortar
bomb
Kimura
shouted
to
the
second
soldier
waiting
by
the
barbed
wire
He
brushed
the
flies
from
his
face
and
spoke
to
the
object
as
if
murmuring
to
a
baby
He
raised
it
behind
his
head
in
the
position
taken
by
the
Japanese
soldiers
throwing
a
grenade
Jim
waited
for
the
explosion
and
then
realized
that
Private
Kimura
was
holding
a
large
fresh-water
turtle
The
creature's
head
emerged
from
its
carapace
and
Kimura
began
to
laugh
excitedly
His
tubercular
face
resembled
a
small
boy's
reminding
Jim
that
Private
Kimura
had
once
been
a
child
as
he
himself
had
been
before
the
war
After
crossing
the
parade
ground
the
Japanese
soldiers
disappeared
among
the
lines
of
ragged
washing
between
the
barrack
huts
Jim
emerged
from
the
damp
cavern
of
the
blockhouse
Wearing
the
leather
golfing
shoes
given
to
him
by
Dr
Ransome
he
climbed
through
the
wire
In
his
hand
he
carried
Kimura's
turtle
The
ancient
creature
contained
at
least
a
pound
of
meat
and
Basie
almost
certainly
would
know
a
special
recipe
for
turtle
Jim
could
imagine
Basie
tempting
it
out
of
its
shell
with
a
live
caterpillar
then
skewering
its
head
with
his
jack-knife
In
front
of
Jim
was
Lunghua
Camp
his
home
and
universe
for
the
past
three
years
and
the
suffocating
prison
of
nearly
two
thousand
Allied
nationals
The
shabby
barrack
huts
the
cement
dormitory
blocks
the
worn
parade
ground
and
the
guardhouse
with
its
leaning
watch-tower
lay
together
under
the
June
sun
a
rendezvous
for
every
fly
and
mosquito
in
the
Yangtze
basin
But
once
he
stepped
through
the
wire
fence
Jim
felt
the
air
steady
around
hirn
He
ran
along
the
cinder
path
his
tattered
shirt
flying
from
his
bony
shoulders
like
the
tags
of
washing
between
the
huts
In
his
ceaseless
journeys
around
the
camp
Jim
had
learned
to
recognise
every
stone
and
weed
A
sun-bleached
sign
crudely
painted
with
the
words
Regent
Street
was
nailed
to
a
bamboo
pole
beside
the
pathway
Jim
ignored
it
as
he
did
the
similar
signs
enscribed
Piccadilly
Knightsbridge
and
Petticoat
Lane
which
marked
the
main
pathways
within
the
camp
These
relics
of
an
imaginary
London
which
many
of
the
Shanghai-born
British
prisoners
had
never
seen
intrigued
Jim
but
in
some
way
annoyed
him
With
their
constant
talk
about
pre-war
London
the
older
British
families
in
the
camp
claimed
a
special
exclusiveness
He
remembered
a
line
from
one
of
the
poems
that
Dr
Ransome
had
made
him
memorize
a
foreign
field
that
is
for
ever
England
But
this
was
Lunghua
not
England
Naming
the
sewage-stained
paths
between
the
rotting
huts
after
a
vaguely
remembered
London
allowed
too
many
of
the
British
prisoners
to
shut
out
the
reality
of
the
camp
another
excuse
to
sit
back
when
they
should
have
been
helping
Dr
Ransome
to
clear
the
septic
tanks
To
their
credit
in
Jim's
eyes
neither
the
Americans
nor
the
Dutch
and
Belgians
in
the
camp
wasted
their
time
on
nostalgia
The
years
in
Lunghua
had
not
given
Jim
a
high
opinion
of
the
British
And
yet
the
London
street
signs
fascinated
him
part
of
the
magic
of
names
that
he
had
discovered
in
the
camp
What
conceivably
were
Lord's
the
Serpentine
and
the
Trocadero
There
were
so
few
books
or
magazines
that
an
unfamiliar
brand-name
had
all
the
mystery
of
a
message
from
the
stars
According
to
Basie
who
was
always
right
the
American
fighters
with
the
ventral
radiators
that
strafed
Lunghua
Airfield
were
called
Mustangs
the
name
of
a
wild
pony
Jim
relished
the
name
to
know
that
the
planes
were
Mustangs
was
more
important
to
him
than
the
confirmation
that
Basie
had
his
ear
to
the
camp's
secret
radio
He
hungered
for
names
Jim
stumbled
on
the
worn
path
unable
to
control
the
golf
shoes
Too
often
these
days
he
became
light-headed
Dr
Ransome
had
warned
him
not
to
run
but
the
American
air
attacks
and
the
imminent
prospect
of
the
war's
end
made
him
too
impatient
to
walk
Trying
to
protect
the
turtle
he
grazed
his
left
knee
He
limped
across
the
cinder
track
and
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
derelict
drinking-water
station
Here
brackish
water
taken
from
the
ponds
in
the
camp
had
once
been
boiled
by
the
prisoners
There
was
still
a
small
supply
of
coal
in
the
camp
store-rooms
but
the
work
gang
of
six
Britons
who
stoked
the
fires
had
lost
interest
Although
Dr
Ransome
remonstrated
with
them
they
preferred
to
suffer
from
chronic
dysentery
rather
than
make
the
effort
of
boiling
the
water
While
Jim
nursed
his
knee
the
members
of
the
gang
sat
outside
the
nearby
barrack
hut
watching
the
sky
as
if
they
expected
the
war
to
end
within
the
next
ten
minutes
Jim
recognised
Mr
Mulvaney
an
accountant
with
the
Shanghai
Power
Company
who
had
often
swum
in
the
pool
at
Amherst
Avenue
Beside
him
was
the
Reverend
Pearce
a
Methodist
missionary
whose
Japanese-speaking
wife
openly
collaborated
with
the
guards
reporting
to
them
each
day
on
the
prisoners
activites
No
one
criticised
Mrs
Pearce
for
this
and
in
fact
most
of
the
prisoners
in
Lunghua
were
only
too
keen
to
collaborate
Jim
vaguely
disapproved
but
agreed
that
it
was
probably
sensible
to
do
anything
to
survive
After
three
years
in
the
camp
the
notion
of
patriotism
meant
nothing
The
bravest
prisoners
and
collaboration
was
a
risky
matter
were
those
who
bought
their
way
into
the
favour
of
the
Japanese
and
thereby
helped
their
fellows
with
small
supplies
of
food
and
bandages
Besides
there
were
few
illicit
activities
to
betray
No
one
in
Lunghua
would
dream
of
trying
to
escape
and
everyone
rightly
ratted
on
any
fool
about
to
step
through
the
wire
for
fear
of
the
reprisals
to
come
The
water-workers
scraped
their
clogs
on
the
steps
and
stared
into
the
sun
moving
only
to
pick
the
ticks
from
between
their
ribs
Although
emaciated
the
process
of
starvation
had
somehow
stopped
a
skin's
depth
from
the
skeleton
below
Jim
envied
Mr
Mulvaney
and
the
Reverend
Pearce
he
himself
was
still
growing
The
arithmetic
that
Dr
Ransome
had
taught
him
made
it
all
too
clear
that
the
food
supplied
to
the
camp
was
shrinking
at
a
faster
rate
than
that
at
which
the
prisoners
were
dying
In
the
centre
of
the
parade
ground
a
group
of
twelve-year-old
boys
were
playing
marbles
on
the
baked
earth
Seeing
the
turtle
they
ran
towards
Jim
Each
of
them
controlled
a
dragonfly
tied
to
a
length
of
cotton
The
blue
flames
flicked
to
and
fro
above
their
heads
Jim!
Can
we
touch
it
What
is
it
Did
Private
Kimura
give
it
to
you
Jim
smiled
benignly
It's
a
bomb
He
held
out
the
turtle
and
generously
allowed
everyone
to
inspect
it
Despite
the
gap
in
years
several
of
the
boys
had
been
close
friends
in
the
days
after
his
arrival
in
Lunghua
when
he
had
needed
every
ally
he
could
find
But
he
had
outgrown
them
and
made
other
friends
Dr
Ransome
Basie
and
the
American
seamen
in
E
Block
with
their
ancient
pre-war
copies
of
the
Reader's
Digest
and
Popular
Mechanics
that
he
devoured
Now
and
then
as
if
recapturing
his
lost
childhood
Jim
reentered
the
world
of
boyish
games
and
would
play
tops
and
marbles
and
hopscotch
Is
it
dead
It's
moving!
It's
bleeding!
A
smear
of
blood
from
Jim's
knee
gave
the
turtle's
head
a
piratical
flourish
Jim
you
killed
it!
The
largest
of
the
boys
Richard
Pearce
reached
out
to
touch
the
reptile
but
Jim
tucked
it
under
his
arm
He
disliked
and
slightly
feared
Richard
Pearce
who
was
almost
as
big
as
himself
He
envied
Richard
the
extra
Japanese
rations
which
his
mother
fed
to
him
As
well
as
the
food
the
Pearces
had
a
small
library
of
confiscated
books
which
they
guarded
jealously
It's
a
blood
bond
Jim
explained
grandly
By
rights
turtles
belonged
to
the
sea
to
the
open
river
visible
a
mile
to
the
west
of
the
camp
that
broad
tributary
of
the
Yangtze
down
which
he
had
once
dreamed
of
sailing
with
his
parents
to
the
safety
of
a
world
without
war
Watch
out
He
waved
Richard
aside
I've
trained
it
to
attack!
The
boys
backed
away
from
him
There
were
times
when
Jim's
humour
made
them
uneasy
Although
he
tried
to
stop
himself
Jim
resented
their
clothes
hand-me-downs
stitched
together
by
their
mothers
but
far
superior
to
his
own
rags
More
than
this
he
resented
that
they
had
mothers
and
fathers
at
all
During
the
past
year
Jim
had
gradually
realized
that
he
could
no
longer
remember
what
his
parents
looked
like
Their
veiled
figures
still
entered
his
dreams
but
he
had
forgotten
their
faces

It
was
in
the
autumn
of
after
long
meditation
that
Amanda
Fergusson
proposed
to
Miss
Logan
the
expedition
to
Arghuri
Miss
Logan
was
a
vigorous
and
seemingly
practical
woman
some
ten
years
older
than
Miss
Fergusson
and
had
been
fond
of
the
Colonel
without
any
zephyr
of
indiscretion
arising
More
to
the
point
she
had
travelled
to
Italy
a
few
years
previously
while
in
the
employment
of
Sir
Charles
B
I
regret
that
I
am
unacquainted
with
the
place
replied
Miss
Logan
when
first
interviewed
Is
it
far
beyond
Naples
It
is
on
the
lower
slopes
of
Mount
Ararat
Miss
Fergusson
responded
The
name
Arghuri
is
derived
from
two
Armenian
words
signifying
he
planted
the
vine
It
is
where
Noah
returned
to
his
agricultural
labours
after
the
Flood
An
ancient
vine
stock
planted
by
the
Patriarch's
own
hands
still
flourishes
Miss
Logan
concealed
her
astonishment
at
this
curious
lecture
but
felt
bound
to
enquire
further
And
why
might
we
be
going
there
To
intercede
for
the
soul
of
my
father
There
is
a
monastery
upon
the
mountain
It
is
a
long
way
to
go
I
believe
it
to
be
appropriate
I
see
Miss
Logan
was
pensive
at
first
but
then
brightened
And
shall
we
drink
the
wine
there
She
was
remembering
her
travels
in
Italy
It
is
forbidden
replied
Miss
Fergusson
Tradition
forbids
it
Tradition
Heaven
then
Heaven
has
forbidden
it
in
memory
of
the
fault
into
which
the
grapes
betrayed
the
Patriarch
Miss
Logan
who
would
complaisantly
allow
the
Bible
to
be
read
to
her
but
was
not
diligent
in
turning
the
pages
herself
exhibited
a
momentary
confusion
Drunkenness
explained
Miss
Fergusson
Noah's
drunkenness
Of
course
The
monks
of
Arghuri
are
permitted
to
eat
the
grapes
but
not
to
ferment
them
I
see
There
is
also
an
ancient
willow
tree
sprung
from
one
of
the
planks
of
Noah's
Ark
which
grows
there
I
see
And
thus
it
was
agreed
They
would
depart
in
the
spring
to
avoid
the
malarial
menace
of
the
later
seasons
Each
would
require
a
portable
bedstead
an
air
mattress
and
a
pillow
they
would
take
some
Oxley's
essence
of
ginger
some
good
opium
quinine
and
Seidlitz
powders
a
portable
inkstand
a
match-box
and
supply
of
German
tinder
umbrellas
against
the
sun
and
flannel
belts
to
ward
off
cramps
of
the
stomach
during
the
night
After
some
discussion
they
decided
not
to
travel
with
either
a
portable
bath
or
a
patent
coffee-machine
But
they
counted
as
necessary
a
pair
of
iron-pointed
walking
sticks
a
clasp-knife
stout
hunting-whips
to
beat
off
the
legions
of
dogs
they
were
prepared
to
encounter
and
a
policeman's
small
lantern
since
they
had
been
warned
that
Turkish
paper
lanterns
were
useless
in
a
hurricane
They
took
mackintoshes
and
heavy
greatcoats
anticipating
that
Lady
Mary
Wortley
Montagu's
dream
of
perennial
sunshine
was
unlikely
to
be
fulfilled
for
lesser
voyagers
Miss
Logan
understood
gunpowder
to
be
the
most
acceptable
offering
for
the
Turkish
peasant
and
writing-paper
for
the
superior
classes
A
common
box-compass
she
had
further
been
advised
would
afford
pleasure
by
directing
the
Mussulman
to
the
point
of
his
prayers
but
Miss
Fergusson
was
disinclined
to
assist
the
heathen
in
his
false
adorations
Finally
the
ladies
packed
two
small
glass
bottles
which
they
intended
to
fill
with
grape
juice
crushed
from
the
fruit
of
Noah's
vineyard
They
travelled
by
Government
steam-packet
from
Falmouth
to
Marseilles
thereafter
entrusting
themselves
to
the
French
conveyances
In
early
May
they
were
received
by
the
British
Ambassador
in
Constantinople
As
Miss
Fergusson
explained
the
extent
and
purpose
of
their
journey
the
diplomat
studied
her
a
dark-haired
woman
in
early
middle
age
with
protuberant
black
eyes
and
rather
full
reddish
cheeks
which
pushed
her
lips
forward
into
a
pout
Yet
she
was
in
no
wise
a
flirt
her
natural
expression
appeared
to
mix
prudishness
with
certainty
a
combination
which
left
the
Ambassador
indifferent
He
grasped
most
of
what
she
was
saying
without
ever
quite
bestowing
upon
her
his
full
attention
Ah
he
said
at
the
finish
there
was
a
rumour
a
few
years
ago
that
some
Russo
had
managed
to
get
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
Parrot
replied
Miss
Fergusson
without
a
smile
Not
a
Russo
I
think
Dr
Friedrich
Parrot
Professor
in
the
University
of
Dorpat
The
Ambassador
gave
a
diagonal
nod
of
the
head
as
if
it
were
slightly
impertinent
to
know
more
than
he
did
about
local
matters
It
seems
to
me
appropriate
and
just
went
on
Miss
Fergusson
that
the
first
traveller
to
ascend
the
mountain
upon
which
the
Ark
rested
should
bear
the
name
of
an
animal
No
doubt
part
of
the
Lord's
great
design
for
us
all
No
doubt
replied
the
Ambassador
looking
away
to
Miss
Logan
for
some
clue
as
to
the
personality
of
her
employer
No
doubt
They
remained
a
week
in
the
Ottoman
capital
by
no
means
long
enough
for
Miss
Logan
to
become
accustomed
to
the
coarse
stares
she
received
at
the
table
d'h
te
Then
the
two
ladies
gave
themselves
up
to
the
Favaid-i-Osmaniyeh
a
Turkish
company
running
steamers
to
Trebizond
The
accommodation
was
crowded
and
to
Miss
Logan's
mind
far
filthier
than
anything
she
had
previously
encountered
She
ventured
upon
deck
the
first
morning
and
was
approached
by
not
one
but
three
potential
beaux
each
with
his
hair
curled
and
exuding
a
powerful
odour
of
bergamot
Thereafter
Miss
Logan
despite
having
been
engaged
for
her
experience
confined
herself
to
the
cabin
Miss
Fergusson
professed
not
to
notice
such
inconveniences
and
to
be
positively
intrigued
by
the
scrum
of
third-class
passengers
on
board
she
would
occasionally
return
with
an
observation
or
a
question
designed
to
stir
Miss
Logan
from
her
dismal
state
of
mind
Why
her
employer
wished
to
know
were
the
Turkish
women
all
accommodated
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
quarter-deck
Was
there
some
purpose
be
it
of
society
or
of
religion
behind
such
positioning
Miss
Logan
was
unable
to
furnish
a
reply
Now
that
they
had
left
Naples
way
behind
them
she
felt
increasingly
less
secure
At
the
faintest
whiff
of
bergamot
she
shuddered
When
Miss
Logan
had
permitted
herself
to
become
engaged
for
the
voyage
to
Asiatic
Turkey
she
had
under-estimated
Miss
Fergusson's
pertinacity
The
absconding
muleteer
the
swindling
innkeeper
and
the
devious
customs-house
officer
were
all
treated
to
the
same
display
of
unthwartable
will
Miss
Logan
lost
count
of
the
times
their
luggage
was
detained
or
they
were
told
that
a
buyurulda
or
special
permit
would
be
necessary
in
addition
to
the
tezkare
they
had
already
procured
but
Miss
Fergusson
with
assistance
from
a
dragoman
whose
own
brief
display
of
independent
thought
had
been
snuffed
out
early
on
harried
demanded
and
succeeded
She
was
tirelessly
willing
to
discuss
things
in
the
manner
of
the
country
to
sit
down
with
a
landlord
for
example
and
answer
such
questions
as
whether
England
was
smaller
than
London
and
which
of
the
two
belonged
to
France
and
how
much
larger
the
Turkish
navy
was
than
those
of
England
France
and
Russia
put
together
Miss
Logan
had
further
imagined
that
their
journey
while
devotional
in
its
final
purpose
might
afford
pleasant
opportunities
for
sketching
the
activity
which
had
first
established
a
bond
between
employer
and
companion
But
antiquities
held
no
charm
for
Amanda
Fergusson
she
had
no
desire
to
examine
heathen
temples
to
Augustus
or
half-surviving
columns
supposedly
erected
in
honour
of
the
apostate
Emperor
Julian
At
least
she
evinced
an
interest
in
the
natural
landscape
As
they
rode
inland
from
Trebizond
hunting-whips
at
the
ready
against
the
expected
dog-packs
they
viewed
mohair
goats
on
hillsides
of
dwarf
oak
dull
yellow
vines
lush
apple
orchards
they
heard
grasshoppers
whose
ringing
note
seemed
sharper
and
more
insistent
than
that
of
their
British
cousins
and
they
witnessed
sunsets
of
the
rarest
purple
and
rose
There
were
fields
of
corn
opium
and
cotton
bursts
of
rhododendron
and
yellow
azalea
red-legged
partridge
hoopoes
and
blue
crows
In
the
Zirgana
mountains
large
red
deer
softly
returned
their
gaze
from
an
apprehensive
distance
At
Erzerum
Miss
Logan
prevailed
upon
her
employer
to
visit
the
Christian
church
The
impulse
proved
at
first
a
happy
one
for
in
the
graveyard
Miss
Fergusson
discovered
tombstones
and
crosses
whose
Celtic
air
recalled
those
of
her
native
Ireland
a
smile
of
approval
crossed
her
dutiful
features
But
this
unexpected
lenity
was
short-lived
Leaving
the
church
the
two
ladies
noticed
a
young
peasant
woman
placing
a
votive
offering
in
a
crevice
by
the
main
door
It
proved
to
be
a
human
tooth
no
doubt
her
own
The
crevice
upon
further
examination
was
found
to
be
stuffed
full
of
yellowing
incisors
and
weathered
molars
Miss
Fergusson
expressed
herself
forcibly
on
the
subject
of
popular
superstition
and
the
responsibility
of
the
clergy
Those
who
preached
the
word
of
God
she
maintained
should
be
judged
according
to
the
word
of
God
and
punished
the
more
severely
if
found
wanting
They
crossed
into
Russia
engaging
at
the
frontier
post
a
new
guide
a
large
and
bearded
Kurd
who
claimed
familiarity
with
the
requirements
of
foreigners
Miss
Fergusson
addressed
him
in
what
seemed
to
Miss
Logan
a
mixture
of
Russo
and
Turk
The
days
when
Miss
Logan's
fluent
Italian
had
been
of
use
to
them
were
long
past
having
begun
the
journey
as
guide
and
interpreter
she
felt
she
had
dwindled
into
a
mere
hanger-on
with
little
greater
status
than
the
discarded
dragoman
or
the
newly-appointed
Kurd
As
the
three
of
them
proceeded
into
Caucasia
they
disturbed
flocks
of
pelican
whose
earthbound
ungainliness
was
miraculously
transfigured
by
flight
Miss
Fergusson's
irritation
over
the
incident
in
Erzerum
began
to
calm
Passing
the
eastern
spur
of
Mount
Alageuz
they
gazed
intently
as
the
broad
bulk
of
Great
Ararat
slowly
revealed
itself
The
summit
was
hidden
enfolded
in
a
circle
of
white
cloud
which
glittered
brilliantly
in
the
sun
It
has
a
halo
exclaimed
Miss
Logan
Like
an
angel
You
are
correct
Miss
Fergusson
replied
with
a
little
nod
People
like
my
father
would
not
agree
of
course
They
would
tell
us
that
such
comparisons
are
all
hot
air
Literally
She
gave
a
pursed
smile
and
Miss
Logan
with
an
enquiring
glance
invited
her
to
continue
They
would
explain
that
the
halo
of
cloud
is
a
perfectly
natural
phenomenon
During
the
night
and
for
several
hours
after
dawn
the
summit
remains
clearly
visible
but
as
the
plain
warms
up
in
the
morning
sun
the
hot
air
rises
and
becomes
vapour
at
a
given
height
At
the
day's
end
when
everything
cools
down
again
the
halo
disappears
It
comes
as
no
surprise
to
science
she
said
with
a
disapproving
emphasis
upon
the
final
word
It
is
a
magic
mountain
commented
Miss
Logan
Her
employer
corrected
her
It
is
a
holy
mountain
She
gave
an
impatient
sigh
There
always
appear
to
be
two
explanations
of
everything
That
is
why
we
have
been
given
free
will
in
order
that
we
may
choose
the
correct
one
My
father
failed
to
comprehend
that
his
explanations
were
based
as
much
upon
faith
as
mine
Faith
in
nothing
It
would
be
all
vapour
and
clouds
and
rising
air
to
him
But
who
created
the
vapour
who
created
the
clouds
Who
ensured
that
Noah's
mountain
of
all
mountains
would
be
blessed
each
day
with
a
halo
of
cloud
Exactly
said
Miss
Logan
not
entirely
in
agreement
That
day
they
encountered
an
Armenian
priest
who
informed
them
that
the
mountain
towards
which
they
were
heading
had
never
been
ascended
and
moreover
never
would
be
When
Miss
Fergusson
politely
suggested
the
name
of
Dr
Parrot
the
priest
assured
her
that
she
was
mistaken
Perhaps
she
was
confusing
Massis
as
he
referred
to
Great
Ararat
with
the
volcano
far
to
the
south
which
the
Turks
called
Sippan
Dagh
The
Ark
of
Noah
before
it
found
its
final
resting-place
had
struck
the
summit
of
Sippan
Dagh
and
removed
its
cap
thereby
exposing
the
inner
fires
of
the
earth
That
mountain
he
understood
was
accessible
to
man
but
not
Massis
On
this
subject
if
on
nothing
else
Christian
and
Mussulman
agreed
And
furthermore
went
on
the
priest
was
it
not
so
proven
by
Holy
Scripture
The
mountain
before
them
was
the
birthplace
of
mankind
and
he
referred
the
ladies
while
excusing
himself
with
an
ingratiating
laugh
for
mentioning
an
indelicate
subject
to
the
authority
of
Our
Saviour's
words
to
Nicodemus
where
it
is
stated
that
a
man
cannot
enter
a
second
time
into
his
mother's
womb
and
be
born
once
more
As
they
were
parting
the
priest
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
black
amulet
worn
smooth
over
many
centuries
It
was
he
claimed
a
piece
of
bitumen
which
assuredly
had
once
formed
part
of
the
hull
of
Noah's
Ark
and
had
great
value
in
the
averting
of
mischief
Since
the
ladies
had
expressed
such
interest
in
the
mountain
of
Massis
then
perhaps
Miss
Fergusson
courteously
responded
to
the
suggested
transaction
by
pointing
out
that
if
indeed
it
was
impossible
to
ascend
the
mountain
then
the
likelihood
of
their
believing
that
the
amulet
could
be
a
piece
of
bitumen
from
the
Patriarch's
vessel
was
not
very
great
The
Armenian
however
saw
no
incompatibility
between
his
two
propositions
Perhaps
a
bird
had
carried
it
down
as
the
dove
had
borne
the
olive
branch
Or
it
might
have
been
brought
by
an
angel
Did
not
tradition
relate
how
Saint
James
had
three
times
attempted
to
ascend
Massis
and
on
the
third
occasion
been
told
by
an
angel
that
it
was
forbidden
but
that
the
angel
had
given
him
a
plank
of
wood
from
the
Ark
and
there
where
he
had
received
it
was
founded
the
monastery
of
Saint
James
They
parted
without
a
bargain
being
struck
Miss
Logan
embarrassed
by
Our
Lord's
words
to
Nicodemus
was
instead
thinking
about
bitumen
was
that
not
the
material
used
by
artists
to
blacken
the
shadows
in
their
paintings
Miss
Fergusson
on
the
other
hand
had
merely
been
put
into
a
temper
first
by
the
attempt
to
thrust
some
foolish
meaning
on
to
the
scriptural
verse
and
secondly
by
the
priest's
brazen
commercial
behaviour
She
had
yet
to
be
impressed
by
the
Eastern
clergy
who
not
only
countenanced
belief
in
the
miraculous
powers
of
human
teeth
but
actually
traded
in
bogus
religious
relics
It
was
monstrous
They
should
be
punished
for
it
No
doubt
they
would
be

Logan

and
nation
the
soil
that
fed
him
and
his
forebears
the
stones
and
sands
of
his
familiar
places
long-silenced
battles
and
struggles
of
conscience
of
the
smiles
of
girls
and
the
slow
utterance
of
old
women
of
accidents
and
the
gradual
action
of
inexorable
law
of
all
this
and
something
else
too
a
single
flame
which
in
every
way
obeys
the
laws
that
pertain
to
Fire
itself
and
yet
is
lit
and
put
out
from
one
moment
to
the
next
and
can
never
be
relumed
in
the
whole
waste
of
time
to
come
So
Randolph
Henry
Ash
ca
when
he
was
writing
Ragnar
k
a
poem
in
twelve
books
which
some
saw
as
a
Christianising
of
the
Norse
myth
and
some
trounced
as
atheistic
and
diabolically
despairing
It
mattered
to
Randolph
Ash
what
a
man
was
though
he
could
without
undue
disturbance
have
written
that
general
pantechnicon
of
a
sentence
using
other
terms
phrases
and
rhythms
and
have
come
in
the
end
to
the
same
satisfactory
evasive
metaphor
Or
so
Roland
thought
trained
in
the
post-structuralist
deconstruction
of
the
subject
If
he
had
been
asked
what
Roland
Michell
was
he
would
have
had
to
give
a
very
different
answer
In
he
was
twenty-nine
a
graduate
of
Prince
Albert
College
London
and
a
PhD
of
the
same
university
His
doctoral
dissertation
was
entitled
History
Historians
and
Poetry
A
Study
of
the
Presentation
of
Historical
Evidence
in
the
Poems
of
Randolph
Henry
Ash
He
had
written
it
under
the
supervision
of
James
Blackadder
which
had
been
a
discouraging
experience
Blackadder
was
discouraged
and
liked
to
discourage
others
He
was
also
a
stringent
scholar
Roland
was
now
employed
part-time
in
what
was
known
as
Blackadder's
Ash
Factory
why
not
Ashram
Val
had
said
which
operated
from
the
British
Museum
to
which
Ash's
wife
Ellen
had
given
many
of
the
manuscripts
of
his
poems
when
he
died
The
Ash
Factory
was
funded
by
a
small
grant
from
London
University
and
a
much
larger
one
from
the
Newsome
Foundation
in
Albuquerque
a
charitable
Trust
of
which
Mortimer
Cropper
was
a
Trustee
This
might
appear
to
indicate
that
Blackadder
and
Cropper
worked
harmoniously
together
on
behalf
of
Ash
This
would
be
a
misconception
Blackadder
believed
Cropper
to
have
designs
on
those
manuscripts
lodged
with
but
not
owned
by
the
British
Library
and
to
be
worming
his
way
into
the
confidence
and
goodwill
of
the
owners
by
displays
of
munificence
and
helpfulness
Blackadder
a
Scot
believed
British
writings
should
stay
in
Britain
and
be
studied
by
the
British
It
may
seem
odd
to
begin
a
description
of
Roland
Michell
with
an
excursus
into
the
complicated
relations
of
Blackadder
Cropper
and
Ash
but
it
was
in
these
terms
that
Roland
most
frequently
thought
of
himself
When
he
did
not
think
in
terms
of
Val
He
thought
of
himself
as
a
latecomer
He
had
arrived
too
late
for
things
that
were
still
in
the
air
but
vanished
the
whole
ferment
and
brightness
and
journeyings
and
youth
of
the
s
the
blissful
dawn
of
what
he
and
his
contemporaries
saw
as
a
pretty
blank
day
Through
the
psychedelic
years
he
was
a
schoolboy
in
a
depressed
Lancashire
cotton
town
untouched
alike
by
Liverpool
noise
and
London
turmoil
His
father
was
a
minor
official
in
the
County
Council
His
mother
was
a
disappointed
English
graduate
He
thought
of
himself
as
though
he
were
an
application
form
for
a
job
a
degree
a
life
but
when
he
thought
of
his
mother
the
adjective
would
not
be
expurgated
She
was
disappointed
In
herself
in
his
father
in
him
The
wrath
of
her
disappointment
had
been
the
instrument
of
his
education
which
had
taken
place
in
a
perpetual
rush
from
site
to
site
of
a
hastily
amalgamated
three-school
comprehensive
the
Aneurin
Bevan
school
combining
Glasdale
Old
Grammar
School
St
Thomas
Beckett's
C
of
E
Secondary
School
and
the
Clothiers
Guild
Technical
Modern
School
His
mother
had
drunk
too
much
stout
gone
up
the
school
and
had
him
transferred
from
metal
work
to
Latin
from
Civic
Studies
to
French
she
had
paid
a
maths
coach
with
the
earnings
of
a
paper-round
she
had
sent
him
out
on
And
so
he
had
acquired
an
old-fashioned
classical
education
with
gaps
where
teachers
had
been
made
redundant
or
classroom
chaos
had
reigned
He
had
done
what
was
hoped
of
him
always
had
four
A's
at
A
Level
a
First
a
PhD
He
was
now
essentially
unemployed
scraping
a
living
on
part-time
tutoring
dogsbodying
for
Blackadder
and
some
restaurant
dishwashing
In
the
expansive
s
he
would
have
advanced
rapidly
and
involuntarily
but
now
he
saw
himself
as
a
failure
and
felt
vaguely
responsible
for
this
He
was
a
small
man
with
very
soft
startling
black
hair
and
small
regular
features
Val
called
him
Mole
which
he
disliked
He
had
never
told
her
so
He
lived
with
Val
whom
he
had
met
at
a
Freshers
tea
party
in
the
Student
Union
when
he
was
eighteen
He
believed
now
though
this
belief
may
have
been
a
mythic
smoothing
of
his
memory
that
Val
was
the
first
person
his
undergraduate
self
had
spoken
to
socially
that
was
not
officially
He
had
liked
the
look
of
her
he
remembered
a
soft
brown
uncertain
look
She
had
been
standing
on
her
own
holding
a
teacup
in
front
of
her
not
looking
about
her
but
rather
fixedly
out
of
the
window
as
though
she
expected
no
one
to
approach
and
invited
no
one
She
projected
a
sort
of
calm
a
lack
of
strife
and
so
he
went
over
to
join
her
And
since
then
they
had
never
not
been
together
They
signed
up
for
the
same
courses
and
joined
the
same
societies
they
sat
together
in
seminars
and
went
together
to
the
National
Film
Theatre
they
had
sex
together
and
moved
together
into
a
one-roomed
flat
in
their
second
year
They
lived
frugally
off
a
diet
of
porridge
and
lentils
and
beans
and
yogurt
they
drank
a
little
beer
making
it
spin
out
they
shared
book-buying
they
were
both
entirely
confined
to
their
grants
which
did
not
go
far
in
London
and
could
not
be
supplemented
with
holiday
earnings
for
these
had
vanished
with
the
oil
crisis
Val
had
been
Roland
was
sure
partly
responsible
for
his
First
Along
with
his
mother
and
Randolph
Henry
Ash
She
simply
expected
it
of
him
she
made
him
always
say
what
he
thought
she
argued
points
she
worried
constantly
about
whether
she
was
whether
they
both
were
working
hard
enough
They
quarrelled
hardly
at
all
and
when
they
did
it
was
almost
always
because
Roland
expressed
concern
about
Val's
reserve
with
the
world
in
general
her
refusal
to
advance
opinions
in
class
and
later
even
to
him
In
the
early
days
she
had
had
lots
of
quiet
opinions
he
remembered
which
she
had
offered
him
shyly
slyly
couched
as
a
kind
of
invitation
or
bait
There
had
been
poems
she
had
liked
Once
she
had
sat
up
naked
in
his
dark
digs
and
recited
Robert
Graves
She
tells
her
love
while
half
asleep
In
the
dark
hours
With
half-words
whispered
low
As
Earth
stirs
in
her
winter
sleep
And
puts
out
grass
and
flowers
Despite
the
snow
Despite
the
falling
snow
She
had
a
rough
voice
gentled
between
London
and
Liverpool
as
the
group
voice
was
When
Roland
began
to
speak
after
this
she
put
a
hand
over
his
mouth
which
was
as
well
for
he
had
nothing
to
say
Later
Roland
noticed
as
he
himself
had
his
successes
Val
said
less
and
less
and
when
she
argued
offered
him
increasingly
his
own
ideas
sometimes
the
reverse
side
of
the
knitting
but
essentially
his
She
even
wrote
her
Required
Essay
on
Male
Ventriloquism
The
Women
of
Randolph
Henry
Ash
Roland
did
want
this
When
he
suggested
that
she
should
strike
out
on
her
own
make
herself
noticed
speak
up
she
accused
him
of
taunting
her
When
he
asked
what
did
she
mean
taunting
she
resorted
as
she
always
did
when
they
argued
to
silence
Since
silence
was
also
Roland's
only
form
of
aggression
they
would
continue
in
this
way
for
days
or
one
terrible
time
when
Roland
directly
criticised
Male
Ventriloquism
for
weeks
And
then
the
fraught
silence
would
modulate
into
conciliatory
monosyllable
and
back
to
their
peaceful
co-existence
When
Finals
came
Roland
did
steadily
and
predictably
well
Val's
papers
were
bland
and
minimal
in
large
confident
handwriting
well
laid-out
Male
Ventriloquism
was
judged
to
be
good
work
and
discounted
by
the
examiners
as
probably
largely
by
Roland
which
was
doubly
unjust
since
he
had
refused
to
look
at
it
and
did
not
agree
with
its
central
proposition
which
was
that
Randolph
Henry
Ash
neither
liked
nor
understood
women
that
his
female
speakers
were
constructs
of
his
own
fear
and
aggression
that
even
the
poem-cycle
Ask
to
Embla
was
the
work
not
of
love
but
of
narcissism
the
poet
addressing
his
Anima
No
biographical
critic
had
ever
satisfactorily
identified
Embla
Val
did
very
badly
Roland
had
supposed
she
had
expected
this
but
it
became
dreadfully
obvious
that
she
had
not
There
were
tears
night-long
choked
whimpering
tears
and
the
first
tantrum
Val
left
him
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
set
up
house
and
went
briefly
home
Home
was
Croydon
where
she
lived
with
her
divorced
mother
in
a
council
flat
supported
by
social
security
supplemented
occasionally
by
haphazard
maintenance
payments
from
her
father
who
was
in
the
Merchant
Navy
and
had
not
been
seen
since
Val
was
five
Val
had
never
during
their
time
together
proposed
to
Roland
that
they
visit
her
mother
though
Roland
had
twice
taken
her
to
Glasdale
where
she
had
helped
his
father
wash
up
and
had
taken
his
mother's
jeering
deflation
of
their
way
of
life
in
her
stride
telling
him
Don't
worry
Mole
I've
seen
it
all
before
Only
mine
drinks
If
you
lit
a
match
in
our
kitchen
it'd
go
up
with
a
roar
When
Val
was
gone
Roland
realised
with
a
shock
like
a
religious
conversion
that
he
did
not
want
their
way
of
life
to
go
on
He
rolled
over
and
spread
his
loosened
limbs
in
the
bed
he
opened
windows
he
went
to
the
Tate
Gallery
alone
and
looked
at
the
dissolving
blue
and
gold
air
of
Turner's
Norham
Castle
He
cooked
a
pheasant
for
his
rival
in
the
departmental
rat-race
Fergus
Wolff
which
was
exciting
and
civilised
although
the
pheasant
was
tough
and
full
of
shot
He
made
plans
which
were
not
plans
but
visions
of
solitary
activity
and
free
watchfulness
things
he
had
never
had
After
a
week
Val
came
back
tearful
and
shaky
and
declared
that
she
meant
at
least
to
earn
her
living
and
would
take
a
course
in
shorthand-typing
At
least
you
want
me
she
told
Roland
her
face
damp
and
glistening
I
don't
know
why
you
should
want
me
I'm
no
good
but
you
do
Of
course
I
do
Roland
had
said
Of
course
When
his
DES
grant
ran
out
Val
became
the
breadwinner
whilst
he
finished
his
PhD
She
acquired
an
IBM
golfball
typewriter
and
did
academic
typing
at
home
in
the
evenings
and
various
well-paid
temping
jobs
during
the
day
She
worked
in
the
City
and
in
teaching
hospitals
in
shipping
firms
and
art
galleries
She
resisted
pressure
to
specialise
She
would
not
be
drawn
out
to
talk
about
her
work
to
which
she
almost
never
referred
without
the
adjective
menial
I
must
do
just
a
few
more
menial
things
before
I
go
to
bed
or
more
oddly
I
was
nearly
run
over
on
my
menial
way
this
morning
Her
voice
acquired
a
jeering
note
not
unfamiliar
to
Roland
who
wondered
for
the
first
time
what
his
mother
had
been
like
before
her
disappointment
which
in
her
case
was
his
father
and
to
some
extent
himself
The
typewriter
clashed
and
harried
him
at
night
never
rhythmical
enough
to
be
ignored

unknown
Now
who
has
planted
this
thick
hedge
of
crimson
roses
in
all
this
dark
green
luxuriant
foliage
with
oh
what
cruel
thorns
Melanie
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
thorns
among
roses
as
if
she
woke
from
a
hundred
years
night
la
belle
au
bois
dormante
imprisoned
in
a
century's
steadily
burgeoning
garden
But
it
was
only
her
new
wallpaper
which
was
printed
with
roses
though
she
had
not
before
noticed
the
thorns
And
familiar
Edward
Bear
lay
on
her
pillow
and
Victoria
slept
on
her
stomach
in
her
cot
six
feet
away
behind
white
painted
bars
Grey
uncertain
light
leaked
in
through
the
curtains
The
tip
of
Melanie's
nose
was
frozen
with
cold
She
put
her
face
in
Edward
Bear's
belly
for
warmth
The
fur
smelled
peppery
She
remembered
yesterday
The
Last
Meal
in
the
Old
Home
like
a
Pre-Raphaelite
painting
the
three
orphans
and
the
grieving
servant
seated
in
melancholy
around
the
old
table
using
the
old
knives
and
forks
they
would
never
use
again
What
would
become
of
the
knives
and
forks
who
would
want
to
buy
them
They
are
stainless
steel
flotsam
swishing
around
the
uncaring
beaches
of
other
people's
lives
They
would
probably
be
thrown
away
They
sat
at
a
table
covered
with
a
checked
tablecloth
and
tiles
clicked
underfoot
Mummy
brought
back
the
tiles
from
Spain
and
there
was
a
big
brick
fireplace
with
horse-brasses
and
copper
pans
and
the
boiler
in
the
middle
for
the
central
heating
where
there
should
have
been
a
huge
fire
But
never
mind
Such
a
lovely
old-fashioned
kitchen
Her
mother
had
once
been
photographed
in
the
kitchen
in
a
frilly
apron
mixing
a
cake
The
photographs
were
printed
in
a
series
of
features
about
celebrities
wives
and
who
they
were
and
how
they
coped
It
was
a
lovely
kitchen
Their
last
meal
in
it
should
have
been
a
kind
of
sacrament
But
Victoria
had
greased
herself
like
an
Eskimo
with
sausage
fat
being
too
young
for
sentiment
Well
good-bye
to
all
that
They
had
come
to
London
and
eaten
rabbit
pie
and
the
day
ended
inappropriately
with
music
and
dancing
Finn
dancing
in
his
stained
vest
and
Francie
playing
the
fiddle
like
the
devil
himself
who
had
been
a
fiddler
and
the
dumb
aunt
in
a
cape
of
fiery
hair
whistling
along
a
flute
Or
had
she
dreamed
it
But
if
so
why
And
if
she
had
not
dreamed
it
how
had
she
got
back
to
bed
Had
Finn
carried
her
She
pictured
herself
in
her
graceless
flannel
pyjamas
clutched
to
Finn's
narrow
young
breast
she
limp
as
a
bolster
with
a
black
wig
on
it
Finn
looked
like
a
satyr
Maybe
his
legs
were
hairy
under
the
worn-out
trousers
coarse-pelted
goat
legs
and
neat
cloven
hooves
Only
he
was
too
dirty
for
a
satyr
who
would
probably
wash
frequently
in
mountain
streams
Finn
looks
untrustworthy
she
thought
His
eyes
were
so
shifting
so
leering
and
slippery
the
slight
cast
made
one
unsure
of
the
direction
of
his
gaze
And
his
ugly
noisy
way
of
breathing
through
his
mouth
He
reminded
her
of
a
clothes
peg-selling
or
paper-flower-hawking
gipsy
who
would
raid
the
henhouse
or
seduce
the
maids
or
steal
the
washing
from
the
line
or
all
three
together
He
disturbed
her
but
not
pleasantly
Still
he
was
young
and
she
had
been
afraid
the
house
would
be
full
of
only
old
people
The
light
looked
tremulous
and
early
She
would
have
liked
to
sleep
again
but
found
she
could
not
and
so
she
had
to
get
up
The
cold
struck
through
her
pyjamas
She
was
accustomed
to
central
heating
She
would
have
to
buy
some
new
thick
pyjamas
for
the
winter
which
was
just
beginning
if
there
was
any
money
But
the
thought
upset
her
would
there
be
any
spare
money
any
pocket-money
for
her
own
small
personal
needs
shampoos
and
stockings
and
perhaps
a
little
face-cream
that
sort
of
thing
There
was
no
way
of
telling
She
belted
her
raincoat
over
her
pyjamas
Her
old
candlewick
cotton
dressing-gown
had
finally
shrunk
to
uselessness
just
before
her
parents
went
away
In
the
rush
of
their
departure
there
had
been
no
time
to
buy
her
a
new
one
We'll
bring
you
a
really
super
one
back
from
America
promised
her
mother
She
had
to
find
her
own
way
to
the
bathroom
and
was
pleased
with
herself
for
so
quickly
remembering
that
it
lay
at
the
end
of
the
passage
She
felt
less
of
a
stranger
once
she
knew
where
the
bathroom
was
Too
tired
to
wash
the
night
before
she
had
not
used
it
Now
feeling
the
train
grubbiness
all
over
her
she
thought
she
might
have
a
bath
It
would
be
good
to
roll
in
hot
water
all
over
But
water
ran
cold
in
the
bathroom
basin
She
held
her
hand
under
the
flow
for
a
long
time
but
the
water
grew
no
warmer
Incredulously
she
had
to
accept
the
fact
that
there
was
no
hot
water
in
the
bathroom
neither
to
bath
in
nor
to
wash
her
face
with
She
had
not
realised
there
were
still
houses
where
there
was
no
hot-water
system
or
that
a
relative
of
hers
might
live
in
one
Neither
was
there
proper
toilet
soap
Squatting
toad-like
in
a
blue
and
white
china
soap-dish
with
a
Greek
key
design
was
a
worn
cake
of
common
household
soap
coarse-textured
and
yellow
and
marked
with
dirty
thumbprints
from
careless
usage
which
stung
her
face
and
probably
corroded
it
She
could
feel
her
skin
corroding
Cold
water
and
washing
soap
this
was
how
it
was
to
be
There
was
a
crack
in
the
deep
old-fashioned
wash-basin
and
a
long
red
hair
was
fixed
in
the
crack
and
floated
out
in
the
water
as
the
basin
filled
The
towel
was
on
a
roller
it
fell
off
towel
and
roller
both
when
she
tried
to
dry
her
hands
The
towel
was
striped
and
not
quite
clean
and
slimy
and
harsh
to
the
touch
at
the
same
time
Four
frayed
toothbrushes
pink
green
blue
and
yellow
were
stuck
in
a
plastic
rack
which
had
got
itself
caked
up
with
toothpaste
On
a
smeared
glass
shelf
a
full
set
of
false
teeth
grinned
faceless
like
a
disappeared
Cheshire
cat
from
a
cloudy
tumbler
The
plastic
gums
were
hectically
coloured
a
sunset
pink
Melanie
thought
they
must
belong
to
Uncle
Philip
He
had
come
back
then
The
lavatory
had
most
of
the
works
of
the
cistern
showing
When
she
tugged
the
chain
which
had
a
pottery
handle
bluntly
instructing
her
to
PULL
on
it
there
was
a
raucous
metallic
clanking
fit
to
wake
the
whole
house
but
not
a
trickle
of
water
came
down
to
flush
the
bowl
She
tried
again
This
time
a
few
reluctant
drops
spattered
the
millpond
surface
but
did
not
disturb
it
She
gave
up
There
was
she
observed
no
toilet
paper
next
to
the
lavatory
but
hanging
from
a
loop
of
string
a
number
of
sheets
of
the
Daily
Mirror
roughly
ripped
into
squares
There
was
a
copy
of
the
Irish
Independent
thrust
down
behind
the
lavatory
pipe
Someone
must
have
been
reading
it
during
an
attack
of
constipation
The
bathroom
was
painted
a
dark
green
half-way
up
the
walls
and
above
that
cream
It
was
a
narrow
high
room
with
unsuitable
stately
proportions
to
the
tall
window
which
was
glazed
with
frosted
glass
and
half-covered
by
a
torn
plastic
curtain
with
Disney
fish
on
it
There
was
no
mirror
in
the
bathroom
not
even
a
shaving
one
Over
the
bath
which
stood
on
four
clawed
brass
feet
and
contained
a
puddle
of
grit-flecked
water
in
which
floated
a
small
plastic
submarine
from
a
packet
of
cereal
was
a
large
geyser
the
exposed
metal
of
which
had
turned
green
with
the
years
Melanie
washed
as
quickly
as
she
could
The
bathroom
depressed
her
very
much
The
Last
Wash
at
the
Old
Home
Not
a
genre
picture
at
all
but
a
photograph
from
an
advertising
book
on
bathrooms
Porcelain
gleamed
pink
and
the
soft
fluffy
towels
and
the
toilet
paper
were
pink
to
match
Steaming
water
gushed
plentifully
from
the
dolphin
shaped
taps
and
jars
of
bath
essence
and
toilet
water
and
after-shave
glowed
like
jewellery
and
the
low
lavatory
tactfully
flushed
with
no
noise
at
all
It
was
a
temple
to
cleanness
Mother
loved
nice
bathrooms
She
thought
bathrooms
were
terribly
important
Don't
said
Melanie
sternly
to
herself
cry
because
of
the
state
of
their
bathroom
But
all
the
same
it
was
hard
She
forced
herself
not
to
think
of
the
old
bathroom
and
by
extension
of
her
mother
Now
though
she
perceived
that
many
things
which
she
had
taken
for
granted
in
her
life
simple
cosy
homely
things
were
in
fact
great
luxuries
No
wonder
there
was
no
inheritance
for
the
children
and
they
must
scrape
themselves
with
newspaper
and
redden
their
pampered
fingers
in
icy
water
now
that
the
goose
who
laid
the
golden
eggs
was
dead
The
bedroom
seemed
already
known
and
safe
She
put
on
her
black
trousers
and
her
chocolate-brown
sweater
because
they
were
at
the
top
of
the
first
suitcase
she
opened
and
she
would
have
worn
them
at
home
on
a
cool
autumn
day
when
there
was
mist
on
the
hills
and
woodsmoke
in
the
lanes
and
She
looked
out
of
the
window
The
morning
was
damp
though
not
rainy
the
grey
day
just
beginning
There
were
a
few
leaves
left
on
the
straggly
garden
bushes
hanging
all
crumpled
and
lifeless
Bare
patches
of
dun-coloured
earth
showed
through
the
scanty
garden-plot
grass
Creepers
grew
on
the
walls
deciduous
they
stretched
out
their
bare
stems
in
a
complicated
network
like
barbed
wire
There
was
a
narrow
alley
with
dustbins
in
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
beyond
that
the
rude
and
unkempt
backsides
of
a
row
of
tenement
houses
with
blind
curtained
windows
and
washing
long
pants
vests
sheets
shirts
limp
in
the
windless
air
strung
out
on
high
lines
running
from
pulleys
at
far-up
windows
Tin
baths
like
giant
snails
stuck
half-way
up
the
walls
as
if
resting
in
a
trip
to
the
top
A
new
territory
lay
here
in
which
she
must
live
Victoria
turned
over
in
her
sleep
and
cooed
at
a
dream
She
was
peachy
and
downy
and
sweet
with
baby
sleep
a
blue
ribbon
in
her
hair
which
was
dark
and
curly
What
would
Victoria
become
here
Would
she
grow
up
into
a
street
urchin
plimsolls
no
socks
grimy
tee
shirt
with
a
London
accent
grating
on
a
nicely-brought-up
ear
And
Jonathon
in
his
cabin
under
the
eaves
And
what
of
herself
of
Melanie
The
house
was
entirely
quiet
Melanie
decided
to
adventure
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
where
she
had
not
been
She
wanted
to
learn
the
new
domestic
geography
as
soon
as
she
could
to
find
out
what
lay
behind
all
the
doors
and
how
to
light
the
stove
and
whereabouts
the
dog
slept
To
make
herself
at
home
She
had
to
make
herself
at
home
somehow
She
could
not
bear
to
feel
such
a
stranger
so
alien
and
somehow
so
insecure
in
her
own
personality
as
if
she
found
herself
hard
to
recognise
in
these
new
surroundings
She
crept
down
the
lino-covered
stairs
The
kitchen
was
quite
dark
because
the
blinds
were
drawn
There
was
a
smell
of
stale
cigarette
smoke
and
some
unwashed
cups
were
stacked
neatly
in
the
sink
but
the
room
was
ferociously
clean
It
was
quite
a
big
room
There
was
a
built-in
dresser
painted
dark
brown
loaded
with
crockery
a
flour
jar
a
bread-bin
There
was
a
larder
you
could
walk
into
Melanie
experimentally
walked
into
it
and
pulled
the
door
to
on
herself
in
a
cool
smell
of
cheese
and
mildew
What
did
they
eat
Tins
of
things
they
seemed
particularly
fond
of
tinned
peaches
there
was
a
whole
stack
of
tins
of
peaches
Tinned
beans
tinned
sardines
Aunt
Margaret
must
buy
tins
in
bulk
There
were
a
number
of
cake
tins
and
Melanie
opened
one
and
found
last
night's
currant
cake
She
took
a
ready-cut
slice
of
it
and
ate
it
It
made
her
feel
more
at
home
already
to
steal
something
from
the
larder
She
went
back
into
the
kitchen
scattering
crumbs

Clara
C
Clara's
father
G
Clara's
mother
J
Headmistress
L
Clara's
family
M
Mrs
Hewitt
Because
there
was
nothing
in
Clara's
past
that
would
seem
to
have
fitted
her
for
such
recognitions
she
was
not
bred
to
it
And
when
she
reflected
as
she
frequently
did
upon
what
she
had
been
bred
to
she
was
profoundly
puzzled
by
her
own
origins
Her
birth
as
far
as
she
could
see
had
been
accidental
no
careful
well-intended
deity
could
have
selected
for
her
her
own
home
But
she
did
not
like
to
admit
the
accidental
for
if
her
birth
was
the
effect
of
chance
so
then
was
her
escape
the
same
arbitrary
law
that
had
produced
her
might
well
have
blinded
her
at
the
most
crucial
moments
of
her
life
and
left
her
forever
desiring
forever
missing
never
achieving
an
eternal
misfit
She
had
seen
people
like
this
She
had
no
confidence
that
time
would
bring
with
it
inevitable
growth
she
grew
by
will
and
by
strain
As
a
child
she
was
always
deeply
affected
by
the
story
of
the
sower
who
sowed
his
seeds
and
some
fell
by
the
wayside
and
some
on
stony
ground
and
some
fell
among
the
thorns
and
some
fell
upon
good
ground
and
bore
fruit
This
story
was
a
favourite
of
the
headmistress
of
her
primary
school
so
she
heard
it
often
at
Morning
Prayers
and
long
before
she
could
see
it
as
a
parable
she
already
felt
shock
before
its
injustice
The
random
scattering
of
seeds
and
how
much
worse
of
human
souls
appalled
her
As
she
grew
older
she
looked
upon
herself
tragically
defiantly
with
all
the
hopelessness
of
fourteen
years
as
a
plant
trying
to
root
itself
upon
the
solid
rock
without
water
without
earth
without
shade
and
then
when
a
little
older
yet
when
conscious
of
some
growth
she
had
to
concede
that
she
must
have
fallen
happily
upon
some
small
dry
sandy
fissure
where
a
few
grains
of
sand
a
few
drops
of
moisture
had
been
enough
to
support
her
trembling
and
tenacious
life
Because
she
would
live
she
would
survive
It
always
amazed
her
to
see
that
other
people
could
live
so
comfortably
upon
such
barren
territory
Northam
was
to
her
the
very
image
of
unfertile
ground
and
yet
other
people
lived
there
and
stayed
there
when
they
had
money
in
the
bank
and
legs
to
walk
away
on
She
hated
her
home
town
with
such
violence
that
when
she
returned
each
vacation
from
University
she
would
shake
and
tremble
with
an
ashamed
and
feverish
fear
She
hated
it
and
she
was
afraid
of
it
because
she
doubted
her
power
to
escape
even
after
two
years
in
London
she
still
thought
that
her
brain
might
go
or
that
her
nerve
might
snap
and
that
she
would
be
compelled
to
return
feebly
defeated
to
her
mother's
house
She
was
so
constantly
braced
her
will
so
stiff
from
desire
that
she
could
not
sleep
at
nights
she
feared
that
if
she
fell
asleep
she
might
lose
her
determination
and
her
faith
might
wake
up
alone
in
her
narrow
bed
in
the
small
back
bedroom
overlooking
the
small
square
garden
backing
onto
the
next
small
square
garden
where
for
so
many
years
she
had
lain
and
dreamed
her
subversive
dreams
She
was
frightened
of
this
and
also
she
was
frightened
of
her
mother
Her
father
was
dead
He
was
killed
on
a
pedestrian
crossing
when
Clara
was
sixteen
Those
who
took
an
interest
in
Clara
might
have
seen
in
his
death
the
loss
of
an
ally
because
outwardly
at
least
he
appeared
to
be
more
intelligent
than
his
wife
at
least
he
did
not
scorn
in
public
as
she
did
all
efforts
of
the
mind
and
all
the
aims
of
education
But
in
fact
he
had
never
been
particularly
sympathetic
towards
Clara
and
paid
but
a
feeble
and
superficial
attention
to
her
progress
He
did
not
like
children
he
did
not
much
like
anything
He
took
slightly
more
interest
in
his
two
sons
Arthur
and
Alan
but
not
through
any
natural
preference
for
them
it
was
simply
that
with
them
he
knew
better
what
questions
should
be
asked
His
work
which
he
pursued
at
the
Town
Hall
was
never
mentioned
in
the
house
and
as
far
as
Clara
could
gather
it
was
mathematical
highly
respectable
and
highly
dull
When
people
asked
Mrs
Maugham
where
her
daughter
got
her
brains
from
she
would
sniff
and
shrug
her
shoulders
and
say
as
though
disclaiming
a
vice
or
a
disease
Well
she
certainly
didn't
get
them
from
me
she
must
have
got
them
from
him
I
suppose
a
remark
which
Clara
took
years
to
place
in
all
its
ambiguity
for
the
truth
was
that
Mrs
Maugham
had
done
well
at
school
she
had
shone
and
prospered
and
the
evidence
of
her
distant
triumphs
still
lay
around
the
house
in
the
form
of
inscribed
Sunday
school
prizes
But
whatever
talents
she
had
once
had
she
had
now
turned
ferociously
against
them
whereas
her
husband
did
still
pay
a
curious
self-willed
homage
to
the
intellectual
virtues
he
possessed
an
edition
of
the
Encyclopaedia
Britannica
which
he
would
from
time
to
time
read
He
would
also
exhort
his
children
to
read
it
and
laid
great
stress
upon
the
utility
of
information
His
own
father
had
been
a
skilled
mechanic
a
phrase
which
conveyed
little
to
Clara
and
as
he
himself
had
managed
to
purchase
by
his
own
labours
a
three
bedroomed
semi-detached
house
in
a
pleasant
suburban
district
he
might
have
been
thought
to
have
cause
to
feel
fairly
content
with
life
But
he
did
not
He
was
perpetually
in
the
grip
of
some
obscure
niggling
unexplained
bitterness
which
led
him
to
repudiate
most
of
the
overtures
which
Clara
would
from
time
to
time
make
towards
him
she
made
these
attempts
because
she
was
less
frightened
of
him
than
she
was
of
her
mother
and
she
did
on
one
or
two
occasions
the
purchase
of
a
bicycle
permission
to
go
to
the
cinema
manage
to
enlist
his
sympathies
But
she
could
see
that
his
heart
was
not
in
it
And
truly
she
could
not
blame
him
She
could
hardly
bear
to
think
the
thought
but
it
did
seem
to
her
that
anyone
who
had
lived
for
so
many
years
with
her
mother
could
be
excused
for
a
certain
lack
of
joie
de
vivre
When
he
died
she
felt
no
real
grief
The
only
reality
of
the
event
had
been
her
mother's
reaction
which
was
silent
grim
and
grudging
to
the
last
not
a
tear
did
she
shed
and
after
the
funeral
as
she
turned
away
from
the
graveside
and
started
to
walk
slowly
through
the
cemetery
mud
she
set
her
mouth
in
that
prophetic
way
and
straightened
her
thick
body
and
then
as
she
passed
a
gravestone
announcing
that
death
is
but
a
separation
she
opened
her
mouth
and
said
Well
he's
gone
and
I
can't
say
I'm
sorry
And
Clara
walking
by
her
side
and
hearing
these
words
burst
suddenly
and
at
last
into
loud
hysterical
weeping
and
as
the
tears
flooded
down
her
hot
cheeks
she
knew
that
they
were
not
for
her
father
but
for
the
meanness
and
the
lack
of
love
and
for
the
fear
that
she
would
die
in
so
ugly
a
hole
and
so
unloved
Nobody
comforted
her
for
weeping
was
not
necessary
but
it
was
on
the
other
hand
permissible
and
when
she
got
home
the
aunts
and
uncles
were
kind
to
her
and
offered
her
cups
of
tea
Even
her
brothers
were
kind
though
embarrassed
and
Clara
as
she
sat
there
picking
endlessly
at
the
fringe
of
the
tablecloth
had
a
vision
of
some
other
world
where
violent
emotion
could
be
a
thing
of
beauty
where
even
tears
could
be
admitted
and
not
ignored
where
good
taste
in
tomb
stones
consisted
not
in
cheap
restrained
economy
of
design
fabric
and
word
but
of
marble
angels
wildly
grieving
Anything
anything
would
make
death
tolerable
she
thought
anything
that
could
admit
something
of
the
grand
somewhere
and
not
this
small
cramped
sitting
room
this
domestic
duplicity
this
pouring
of
cups
of
tea
these
harshly
unaltered
faces
One
tear
would
have
sufficed
her
one
murmur
of
regret
but
there
was
nothing
the
family
were
not
even
in
mourning
for
they
found
the
wearing
of
mourning
a
false
and
hypocritical
extravagance
They
would
admit
nothing
they
sat
there
like
stones
and
their
one
aim
was
to
sit
there
like
stones
so
that
no
one
could
tell
if
they
cared
or
did
not
care
so
that
there
should
be
no
difference
between
caring
and
not
caring
The
funeral
itself
had
been
a
grotesque
manifestation
of
Mrs
Maugham's
opinions
She
had
refused
to
have
her
husband
cremated
not
because
she
had
anything
so
fanciful
as
a
religious
objection
to
cremation
but
because
she
quite
erroneously
considered
cremation
to
be
a
new-fangled
idea
and
she
objected
to
the
new
She
had
been
brought
up
as
a
chapel-goer
and
two
generations
back
her
family
had
been
staunch
Wesleyans
but
she
herself
had
long
since
dropped
any
pretence
to
faith
of
any
kind
and
now
considered
all
religious
observation
as
ridiculous
frivolity
However
she
maintained
the
moral
impetus
of
her
early
years
although
she
had
quite
cast
off
its
derivations
and
turned
her
back
upon
its
fraudulent
source
the
narrow
fervours
and
disapprovals
were
there
but
their
objects
had
subtly
altered
over
the
years
So
that
the
wearing
of
mourning
fifty
years
earlier
a
sign
of
virtue
had
now
in
Mrs
Maugham's
generation
become
a
habit
to
be
scorned
and
condemned
it
was
ostentatious
and
therefore
it
was
insincere
And
her
dislike
of
the
insincere
ran
so
deep
that
she
would
rather
publicly
disclaim
all
grief
for
her
dead
husband
than
be
accused
of
insincerity
But
it
took
a
trained
observer
to
follow
her
through
the
quicksands
of
her
disapprobation
a
false
step
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
aunts
for
instance
could
have
reversed
her
attitude
and
led
her
into
a
eulogy
of
black
into
a
martyred
position
whence
the
garments
of
all
the
others
were
an
insult
to
her
lone
and
exclusive
widowhood
into
a
position
where
she
alone
had
the
right
to
flout
the
weight
of
tradition
She
was
as
Clara
had
discovered
at
an
early
age
colossally
inconsistent
and
sometimes
Clara
thought
that
it
might
have
been
easier
to
live
with
a
true
religious
fanatic
whose
fads
and
fancies
would
be
at
least
predictable
and
well-marshalled
with
the
backing
of
some
kind
of
external
authority
from
which
there
could
be
some
appeal
As
it
was
it
was
impossible
for
even
the
most
servile
and
well-meaning
to
avoid
offence
For
what
Mrs
Maugham
thought
one
week
to
be
wholly
disgraceful
she
was
praising
the
next
and
with
no
apparent
consciousness
of
discrepancy
For
instance
there
was
the
question
of
the
coffin
Clara
could
not
count
the
times
she
had
heard
her
mother
declare
that
when
she
died
she
would
be
dead
and
she
wouldn't
care
what
happened
to
her
body
and
for
all
she
cared
they
could
put
her
out
for
the
dustman
to
collect
sentiments
which
from
the
first
had
filled
Clara
with
a
vague
alarm
and
horror
for
they
were
clearly
reasonable
enough
in
their
own
way
And
yet
when
her
husband
died
the
price
and
quality
of
the
coffin
became
topics
of
obsessive
interest
and
the
precise
balance
of
economy
and
decency
a
subject
for
endless
dissertation
Clara
heard
again
and
again
of
Mrs
Hewitt
who
buried
her
husband
in
an
economy
coffin
of
some
inappropriately
cheap
and
porous
wood
and
claimed
a
rebate
from
the
insurance
and
of
the
equally
wicked
and
abandoned
Mrs
Duffy
who
had
squandered
a
fortune
on
black
crepe
and
gilt
handles
through
a
sheer
love
of
ostentation
In
the
end
Clara
exasperated
beyond
endurance
brought
up
once
more
the
possibility
of
cremation
not
daring
to
mention
even
in
her
own
mind
which
had
not
quite
forsaken
filial
tenderness
the
possibility
of
the
once-praised
dust
cart
and
Mrs
Maugham
square
immutable
said
quite
astonishingly
for
her
and
invoking
sanctions
she
had
been
deriding
for
thirty
years
that
ashes
must
go
to
ashes
and
dust
to
dust
Clara
forbore
to
point
out
that
cremation
did
result
precisely
in
ashes
because
she
took
expertly
her
mother's
meaning
which
was
that
cremation
was
an
unnatural
practice
and
that
bodies
ought
to
rot
quietly
at
their
own
leisure
And
moreover
Clara
had
even
seen
in
the
phrase
some
dim
far-off
flicker
of
comfort
because
harsh
though
it
was
it
was
not
without
a
consoling
figurative
literary
beauty

X

Wedding
Bells
Shop!
Bunty
has
turned
herself
into
a
bag
lady
She
is
carrying
so
many
smart
paper
bags
that
she
can't
see
where
she's
going
and
almost
falls
through
the
Shop
door
dislodging
part
of
the
hearing-aid
battery
display
as
she
sinks
down
with
a
grateful
sigh
into
the
nearest
wheelchair
and
kicks
off
her
shoes
It's
murder
out
there
she
informs
us
It's
going
to
be
murder
in
here
when
George
finds
out
how
much
money
she's
just
spent
What
the
heck
have
you
been
buying
he
asks
as
she
fishes
out
a
hat
and
sticks
it
on
her
head
The
hat
is
pea-green
satin
and
looks
like
a
drum
George
stares
aghast
at
the
drum-hat
Why
have
you
bought
that
Don't
you
like
it
she
says
swivelling
her
head
round
just
like
the
Parrot
used
to
Her
tone
of
voice
indicates
that
she
hasn't
the
faintest
interest
in
whether
George
likes
it
or
not
She
conjures
a
pair
of
shoes
from
nowhere
Lovely
aren't
they
They're
wickedly
narrow
with
long
stiletto
heels
in
the
same
shade
of
green
as
the
hat
You
know
from
looking
at
them
that
they'll
be
worn
once
and
never
again
She
crams
a
foot
into
one
of
her
new
shoes
with
all
the
determination
of
an
ugly
sister
You
could
cut
your
toes
off
I
suggest
helpfully
The
number
of
as
yet
unplundered
bags
at
Bunty's
feet
implies
that
she
might
have
been
buying
things
to
wear
in
between
the
extremities
of
hat
and
shoes
She
wrestles
with
a
particularly
large
Leak
and
Thorp's
bag
And
Bunty
says
like
a
magician's
assistant
Ta-ra!
and
produces
a
matching
dress
and
coat
in
a
slightly
darker
shade
of
soupy
pea-green
in
a
heavy
artificial
shot-silk
Why
George
asks
with
a
pained
look
on
his
face
For
the
wedding
of
course
Bunty
holds
up
the
dress
against
herself
in
a
sitting-position
like
an
invalid
She
turns
to
me
What
do
you
think
I
sigh
and
shake
my
head
in
envy
and
longing
It's
lovely
Extracts
from
Ruby
Lennox's
school
report
summer
term
Ruby
has
a
real
talent
for
acting
Ruby
was
the
star
of
the
school
play
The
wedding
George
is
thoroughly
gamed
now
Whose
wedding
Ted's
of
course
Ted
and
Sandra's
Ted
Yes
Ted
My
brother
she
adds
helpfully
as
George
stares
blankly
at
her
Ted
and
Sandra
Their
wedding's
on
Saturday
don't
tell
me
you've
forgotten
This
Saturday
George
seems
to
be
having
a
mild
apoplectic
fit
But
he
splutters
and
flounders
They
can't
get
married
this
Saturday-
it's
the
World
Cup
Final!
So
Bunty
says
weighting
the
one
little
syllable
with
a
heavy
mixed
cargo
of
disdain
indifference
and
wilful
misunderstanding
not
to
mention
twenty
years
of
marital
antipathy
Even
a
Mandarin-speaking
Chinaman
would
be
floored
by
the
subtleties
of
Bunty's
intonation
George
is
stunned
So
he
repeats
staring
at
her
as
if
she'd
just
grown
a
second
head
So
This
could
go
on
for
ever
I
cough
politely
Ahem
Have
you
got
a
cough
Bunty
asks
accusingly
No
it's
just
I
have
to
get
back
to
school
It's
a
Monday
lunchtime
and
Janice
Potter
has
persuaded
me
to
sign
out
with
her
you
can
only
leave
school
in
pairs
and
you're
supposed
to
stick
like
glue
to
each
other
in
case
you're
raped
robbed
or
lost
so
she
can
go
to
the
Museum
Gardens
to
smoke
and
snog
with
her
boyfriend
Cast
adrift
at
the
gates
I
have
washed
up
at
the
Shop
Bunty
suddenly
drops
her
bags
and
leaps
from
the
wheelchair
like
a
Lourdes
miracle
and
says
and
hustles
a
hapless
George
out
to
help
her
choose
that
is
pay
for
a
wedding
present
for
Ted
and
Sandra
And
so
here
I
am
abandoned
to
mind
the
Shop
sometimes
I
feel
like
Bunty
a
discomfiting
thought
to
say
the
least
Will
I
turn
out
like
my
mother
Will
I
be
pretty
Will
I
be
rich
I'm
fourteen
and
already
I've
had
enough
Bunty
was
nearly
twice
my
age
before
she
started
saying
that
I'm
an
only
child
now
with
all
the
advantages
money
clothes
records
and
all
the
disadvantages
loneliness
isolation
anguish
I'm
all
they've
got
left
a
ruby
solitaire
a
kind
of
chemical
reduction
of
all
their
children
Patricia
Gillian
P-
Ruby
what's
your
name
Luckily
I
now
know
that
all
mothers
do
this
as
soon
as
they
have
more
than
one
child
Mrs
Gorman
Kathleen's
mother
has
to
run
through
an
astonishing
litany
of
children
Billy-Michael-Doreen-Patrick-Frances-Joe
before
she
arrives
at
Kathleen-or-whatever-your-name-is
Being
a
Monday
business
is
slack
so
I
occupy
my
time
by
deputising
for
one
of
Bunty's
prime
functions
wrapping
the
Durex
I
take
up
my
position
by
the
huge
roll
of
brown
paper
that's
bolted
on
to
the
wall
behind
the
counter
and
patiently
pull
and
rip
pull
and
rip
until
I've
got
a
good
supply
of
big
square
pieces
Then
I
take
the
pair
of
Nurses
Surgical
Steel
Scissors
Best
Quality
that
are
chained
to
the
counter
and
set
about
cutting
up
the
big
squares
into
smaller
squares
like
a
particularly
dull
Blue
Peter
demonstration
When
I've
done
that
I
get
out
a
new
box
of
Gossamer
from
the
storeroom
at
the
back
which
was
once
the
dining-room
and
wrap
the
individual
packets
of
three
neatly
folding
and
sellotaping
each
end
of
the
little
brown
paper
envelopes
Now
the
Durex
can
be
handed
over
like
gifts
Here's
one
I
prepared
earlier
rapidly
and
discreetly
to
our
valued
customers
Not
by
me
of
course
I
have
not
yet
managed
to
sell
one
packet
while
I've
been
left
in
charge
of
the
Shop
no-one
seems
keen
to
buy
their
rubber
johnnies
A
planned
family
is
a
happy
family
from
a
fourteen-year-old
child
and
when
they
charge
into
the
shop
change
at
the
ready
and
see
me
their
eyes
immediately
shift
to
the
nearest
likely
object
and
they
shame
out
in
dissatisfaction
clutching
a
packet
of
corn
plasters
or
a
pair
of
nail-clippers
and
in
this
way
I
am
probably
personally
responsible
for
a
great
many
unplanned
families
I
have
wrapped
an
entire
gross
box
of
Durex
and
still
they're
not
back
How
long
does
it
take
to
choose
a
present
Perhaps
they've
run
away
from
home
I
slump
disconsolately
into
an
electric
wheelchair
and
push
the
control
stick
to
Slow
forward
and
trundle
round
the
Shop
pretending
to
be
a
Dalek
I
am
a
Dalek
I
am
a
Dalek
For
my
Dalek
gun
I
use
the
dismembered
dummy
leg
that
models
an
Elastanet
two-way
stretch
stocking
and
exterminate
a
stand
of
male
urinals
a
shelf
of
Dol's
Flannel
and
two
miniature
bakelite
torsos
one
male
one
female
who
face
each
other
across
the
Shop
Greek
and
mutely
tragic
displaying
their
little
surgical
corsets
to
each
other
Restoring
the
male
urinals
to
their
former
positions
balanced
on
top
of
each
other
like
a
circus
tightrope
act
And
now
the
fantastic
death-defying
one-and-only
Male
Urinals!
I
think
about
how
I
miss
the
Pets
For
one
thing
they
were
a
less
embarrassing
stock
to
carry
It's
not
just
the
contraceptives
the
Durex
the
mysterious
jellies
and
foams
and
the
Dutch
caps
there's
a
high
snigger
factor
to
nearly
everything
we
carry
The
glass
counter
is
full
of
jock
straps
and
incontinence
pads
there's
a
shelf
full
of
prosthetic
breasts
like
small
conical
sandbags
another
of
trusses
that
look
more
like
something
you'd
put
on
a
horse
then
there
are
the
colostomy
bags
and
this
month's
special
offer
is
on
rubber
sheeting
thick
red
stuff
that
George
cuts
from
a
heavy
roll
that
smells
like
car
tyres
They
might
have
given
some
thought
to
the
effect
that
this
has
on
my
social
life
And
what
exactly
do
your
parents
sell
Ruby
I
even
miss
the
Parrot
It's
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
the
same
Shop
it
was
before
the
fire
I
often
go
upstairs
into
the
empty
rooms
where
we
once
lived
and
try
to
call
the
past
back
Above
the
Shop
has
fallen
into
a
rapid
decay
it's
never
really
been
put
back
to
rights
since
the
fire
Whitewash
balloons
off
the
ceiling
where
Patricia
once
slept
and
the
bedroom
I
shared
with
Gillian
has
an
odd
smell
in
it
the
aroma
of
something
decaying
like
a
dead
rat
concealed
behind
the
wainscot
It
seems
now
as
if
Above
the
Shop
was
just
a
trick
of
lath
and
plaster
and
light
and
yet
sometimes
if
I
stand
on
the
stairs
and
close
my
eyes
I
can
hear
the
voices
of
the
household
ghosts
being
carried
hither
and
thither
on
a
current
of
air
Do
they
miss
us
I
wonder
Sometimes
I
think
I
hear
the
Parrot
a
ghostly
squawk
echoing
around
the
Shop
Sometimes
I
think
I
can
hear
it
on
the
other
end
of
the
telephone
all
the
way
out
in
Acomb
We
don't
only
have
telephone
calls
from
spectral
parrots
we
also
have
calls
from
nobody
at
all
a
mute
phantom
phoner
who
manifests
himself
as
crackling
static
down
the
wires
When
George
answers
these
silent
calls
he
stares
for
a
few
seconds
at
the
receiver
as
if
it
personally
was
to
blame
and
then
slaps
it
back
down
in
the
cradle
and
walks
off
in
disgust
Bunty
persists
a
little
longer
trying
to
coax
a
response
by
repeating
her
normal
phone
greeting
Hello
this
is
the
Lennox
residence
Bunty
Lennox
speaking
how
can
I
help
you
which
is
enough
to
put
off
all
but
the
most
determined
caller
and
our
poor
spook
is
anything
but
robust
Mr
Nobody
again
Bunty
says
as
if
he
was
a
personal
friend
But
when
I
answer
I
hang
on
for
the
longest
time
waiting
and
hoping
for
a
message
I'm
sure
it's
Patricia
on
the
other
end
of
the
phone
we
haven't
heard
from
her
for
well
over
a
year
and
surely
she'll
be
in
touch
soon
Patricia
Patricia
I
whisper
urgently
into
the
receiver
but
if
it
is
her
she
doesn't
answer
Your
sister
says
not
to
worry
would
do
see
Footnote
x
Bunty
must
still
expect
Patricia
home
because
she
has
left
her
room
untouched
and
as
Patricia
was
not
the
tidiest
of
girls
and
her
room
was
always
littered
with
dirty
clothing
and
food
crumbs
it
has
by
now
taken
on
a
Miss
Haversham-air
of
decay
and
will
probably
soon
revert
to
primordial
slime
Perhaps
it
isn't
Patricia
at
all
but
our
Gillian
wandering
in
limbo
and
trying
to
phone
home
But
can
spirits
make

Tory
alarm
over
call

LABOUR
was
last
night
accused
of
trying
to
tear
Britain's
heart
out
over
its
threat
to
change
the
role
of
the
Royal
Family
Shadow
Home
Secretary
Jack
Straw
called
for
the
Queen
to
be
stripped
of
most
of
her
powers
and
the
number
of
working
Royals
cut
to
around
six
The
monarchy
would
be
run
more
along
the
lines
of
Scandinavian
countries
with
its
most
popular
member
the
Queen
Mother
probably
left
out
Mr
Straw
who
claimed
ominously
added
that
the
changes
did
not
necessarily
spell
the
end
of
royal
rule
Home
Secretary
Michael
Howard
immediately
warned
of
the
devastating
effect
a
future
Labour
government
would
have
on
Britain
Mr
Blair
is
already
committed
to
a
Scottish
parliament
a
Welsh
assembly
and
a
ban
on
hereditary
peers
in
a
radical
reform
of
the
House
of
Lords
Only
last
Friday
John
Major
pointed
out
that
Labour's
plans
which
he
described
as
a
sort
of
teenage
madness
would
lead
to
the
break-up
of
the
UK
Last
night
Labour's
Left-wing
went
even

than
Mr
Straw
calling
for
a
referendum
on
the

abolition

Labour's

said

He
writes
in
the
socialist
magazine
Fabian
Review
If
heredity
has
no
place
in
Blair's
new
Britain
then
clearly
the
Royal
Family
has
no
place
either
If
Elizabeth
Windsor
can
be
shown
to
be
ill-suited
to
reign
Britain's
constitutional
crisis
could
be
on
us
sooner
than
we
expect
Mr
Straw's
attack
to
be
screened
on
BBC's
Panorama
tonight
thrust
the
question
of
the
country's
constitutional
future
on
the
agenda
for
the
next
general
election
campaign
He
admitted
that
Labour
wanted
to
reduce
the
Queen's
powers
over
Parliament
and
added
We
have
a
series
of
constitutional
proposals
including
changes
to
the
royal
prerogative
I
think
it
will
hasten
the
process
towards
a
more
Scandinavian
monarchy
a
monarch
symbolising
a
much
more
classless
society
someone
who's
above
the
political
battle
than
has
been
the
case
That
doesn't
necessarily
spell
the
end
of
the
monarchy
not
for
a
second
But
it
does
mean
the
monarchy's
role
will
be
redefined
The
Home
Secretary
says
in
today's
Daily
Express
that
the
full
extent
of
Labour's
wrecking
plans
is
becoming
clear
Mr
Howard
adds
It
would
amount
to
the
break-up
of
the
Britain
we
love
He
warns
that
Labour's
plans
are
the
first
step
towards
introducing
a
republic
Having
a
directly-elected
president
is
a
logical
consequence
of
Labour's
plans
he
says
Last
night
Mr
Straw
insisted
he
was
simply
reflecting
the
debate
taking
place
across
Britain
as
well
as
the
anger
at
what
he
called
Tory
abuse
of
the
constitution
But
Social
Security
Secretary
Peter
Lilley
warned
that
Mr
Straw's
stance
risked
alienating
Labour
voters
often
more
conservative
about
the
Royal

than
Tories
He
promised
We
have
to
fight
vigorously
to
defend
our

the

Future

PRESIDENT
Clinton
was
set
to
snub
John
Major
last
night
as
the
special
relationship
took
a
dramatic
turn
for
the
worse
Intense
diplomatic
efforts
have
failed
to
secure
a
full-scale
meeting
between
the
two
on
the
fate
of
British
troops
in
Bosnia
The
Prime
Minister
may
have
to
be
satisfied
with
brief
informal
talks
The
U.S
delegation
at
a
pan-European
security
summit
in
Budapest
is
concentrating
on
setting
up
talks
with
Russian
President
Boris
Yeltsin
Mr
Clinton's
snub
to
Mr
Major
comes
amid
an
angry
diplomatic
battle
between
Britain
and
America
over
the
West's
role
in
Bosnia
The
Americans
want
to
take
steps
to
arm
Bosnian
Moslems
who
are
under
siege
from
Serbs
in
several
enclaves
But
Britain
claims
such
a
course
of
action
would
put
at
risk
the
UK's
troops
by
making
them
targets
for
Serb
revenge
attacks
The
spat
came
as
Defence
Secretary
Malcolm
Rifkind
prepared
to
fly
to
Croatia
for
talks
on
whether
to
order
the
biggest
British
retreat
since
Dunkirk
UN
troops
including
British
soldiers
are
increasingly
being
taken
hostage
by
Bosnian
Serbs
as
human
shields
against
UN
air
raids
The
chairman
of
the
Commons
Defence
Committee
Sir
Nicholas
Bonsor
said
last
night
it
was
time
to
get
the
British
troops
out
He
said
I
have
become
increasingly
concerned
about
their
safety
The
position
there
is
obviously
getting
very
much
more
dangerous
Action
Mr
Rifkind
will
meet
top
UN
officials
including
Lieutenant-General
Sir

Rose

General
Rose

in

yesterday
There
is

need
for
political
action
and
a
resolution
of
the
problem
Britain
and
France
won
backing
from
Serbian
President
Slobodan
Milosevic
He
pledged
support
for
an
international
plan
to
divide
Bosnia
between
Serbs
and
a
Moslem-Croat
federation
He
also
called
for
an
immediate
end
to
the
fighting
Foreign
Secretary
Douglas
Hurd
who
flew
to
Belgrade
in
a
new
push
for
peace
said
the
West
was
just
weeks
away
from
pulling
out
if
the
Bosnian
Serb
warlords
rejected
peace
He
warned
that
if
the
warring
factions
refused
to
talk
the
allies
would
have
no
choice
but
to
pull
their
troops
out
and
lift
the
arms
embargo
on
Bosnia's
Moslems
Britain
is
reluctant
to
withdraw
after
two
years
of
gruelling
effort
to
relieve
civilian
suffering
and
prevent
the
war
spreading
The
one
piece
of
good
news
yesterday
was
the
release
by
the
Bosnian
Serbs
of
British
sappers
held
hostage
near
the
besieged
Moslem

For
God's
sake
stop
rewriting
our
Bible
New
scriptures
may
be
PC
but
they're
not
gospel
truth
ANGRY
churchmen
have
condemned
a
politically-correct
Bible
which
has
rewritten
the
scriptures
to
avoid
giving
offence
It
attempts
to
do
away
with
alleged
sexism
racism
and
even
bias
against
left-handed
people
Traditionalists
have
accused
the
authors
of
heresy
and
claim
they
are
making
a
mockery
of
the
Bible
message
We
are
not
at
liberty
to
change
the
word
of
God
just
to
be
politically
correct
said
the
Rev
Tony
Higton
If
you
are
going
to
tear
some
pages
out
of
the
Bible
and
rewrite
others
where
will
it
finish
You
end
up
with
something
that
would
ultimately
be
a
different
religion
The
most
obvious
change
is
the
removal
of
God's
male
identity
Crippled
Jesus
becomes
the
Human
One
instead
of
the
Son
of
Man
and
congregations
will
be
asked
to
thank
Our
Mother
who
art
in
Heaven
The
authors
have
gone
out
of
their
way
to
avoid
any
suggestion
of
anti-Semitism
Jews
as
a
race
are
no
longer
held
responsible
for
crucifying
Christ
Out
go
references
which
class
people
specifically
as
blind
or
crippled
Even
bias
against
left-handed
people
is
banished
The
authors
have
removed
verses
which
talk
of
God's
right
hand
and
replaced
them
with
references
to
God's
mighty
hand
The
changes
have
been
made
by
Oxford
University
Press
in
a
bid
to
take
the
oppression
out
of
Christianity
The
new
Bible
is
to
be
published
in
America
in
February
and
last
night
its
opponents
in
the
Church
of
England
vowed
to
fight
publication
here
Mr
Higton
of
Hawkwell
church
near
Rochford
Essex
said
The
Bible
was
originally
written
in
Hebrew
and
Greek
and
we
do
need
accurate
translation
I
actually
prefer
the
word
Mankind
to
Humanity
But
to
go
as
far
as
removing
bias
against
left-handed
people
is
ridiculous
If
we
allow
these
changes
we
are
making
human
opinions
more
important
than
God's
word-and
that
is
dangerously
close
to
saying
human
beings
are
more
important
than
God
The
Archdeacon
of
York
the
Venerable
George
Austin
said
The
traditional
language
of
the
Bible
is
part
of
its
majesty
It's
ludicrous
to
invent
language
in
this
way
It
will
mean
nothing
to
ordinary
parishioners
Nigel
Lynn
editor
of
OUP's
bible
section
admitted
I'm
sure
some
people
will
take
great
exception
to
it
But
it's

way
you
go

remained
who
Organisers
Camelot

that
whoever
phoned
in

The

is
the

into

He

to

Euro-sceptic
course

Mr

called

The
latest
divisions
emerged
as
the
party
braces
itself
for
a
crushing
defeat
in
Thursday's
Dudley
West
by-election
A
GMTV
poll
yesterday
put
Labour
support
at
per
cent
suggesting
a
landslide
for
Tony
Blair
in
his
first
by-election
as
leader
Questioned
about
the
Euro-rebels
yesterday
Mr
Portillo
said
There
has
to
be
a
healing
process
There
has
to
be
tolerance
Things
are
too
raw
too
difficult
too
excited
We've
had
this
terrible
rift
Let
us
see
whether
the
passage
of
time
a
little
tolerance
can
bring
us
together
Speaking
on
BBC
TV's
Breakfast
with
Frost
he
said
The
problem
with
the
Conservative
Party
is
basically
Europe
That's
the
thing
we
have
to
sort
out
Asked
whether
a
referendum
could
heal
the
rift
he
said
For
me
a
referendum
would
not
be
my
first
choice
Difficult
decisions
should
be
taken
by
Parliament
because
we're
elected
to
take
difficult
decisions
United
If
the
Conservative
Party
comes
out
with
a
clear
united
policy
which
would
be
much
more
Eurosceptical
than
our
opponents
and
much
more
Euro-sceptical
than
the
rest
of
the
continent
that
would
be
a
much
firmer
basis
on
which
to
go
forward
Mr
Portillo's
unexpected
opposition
means
he
has
lined
up
with
Chancellor
Kenneth
Clarke
and
Trade
President
Michael
Heseltine
against
a

But
Foreign

Douglas
Hurd

yesterday
We
are
not
saying

As

Tory
MPs

worried
Mr
Blair
will
steal
a
march
on
Mr
Major

declaring
Labour's

to
hold
one
It
was
reported
yesterday
that
Mr
Blair
told
overseas
newspapers
last
week
there
was
a
clear
case
for
one
Mr
Hurd
also
signalled
he
is

weary
of
the
Tory
feuding
over
Europe
and
may
bow
out

the

Asked

be
Foreign

He

me
next

and

A

Dr

He

although

Last

taking
extraordinary
security

They
also
told

which
saw
him
sharing

two
different
women
The
curtains
at

of
terrace
home
in
the
heart
of
Oxford's
notorious
Blackbird
Leys
estate
were
always
drawn
His
telephone
number
was
ex-directory
and
his
windows

doors
were
always
locked
He
even
draped
a
sheet
over

But
his
murderer
possibly
a
professional
spotted
him
in
his

on
Saturday
afternoon
when
he
went
to
make
a
cup
of
tea
The
Scots-born
doctor
had
not
covered
the
window
and
was
in
full
view
from
a
narrow
alley
running
alongside
the
house
The
killer
walked
down
the
alley
smashed
a
window
with
his
shotgun
then
fired
at
close
range
Dr
Meenaghan
was
hit
in
the

and

quickly
When

broke
into

they
found
him

chief
Jacques
Delors
strong
favourite
to
be
the
next
president
of
France
last
night
said
he
will
not
be
a
candidate
in
the
spring
election
His
decision
will
be
welcomed
by
John
Major
battling
to
contain
Tory
tensions
over
Europe
If
he
had
become
President
arch-federalist
Mr
Delors
would
have
been
a
formidable
opponent
for
the
Prime
Minister
in
his
battle
to
prevent
moves
towards
a
European
superstate
Although
he
dare
not
say
so
publicly
Mr
Major
is
keen
to
see
present
French
prime
minister
Edouard
Balladur
from
the
centre
right
become
president
In
recent
weeks
Mr
Balladur
has
made
speeches
opposing
faster
European
integration
which
Mr
Major
has
warmly
welcomed
as
being
in
line
with
his
own
views
Jacques
Chirac
the
mayor
of
Paris
is
Mr
Balladur's
main
opponent
in
the
race
Mr
Balladur
is
much
more
cautious
about
a
single
currency
for
Europe
than
veteran
Socialist
French
president
Mr
Mitterrand
At
the
Franco-British
summit
at
Chartres
last
month
Mr
Major
and
Mr
Balladur
struck
up
a
good
relationship
and
Mr
Major
was
pleased
to
see
his
French
counterpart
backed
his
determination
to
slow
down
the
push
towards
closer
European
ties
Mr
Delors
is
understood
to
have
told
European
heads
of
government
including
Mr
Major
and
Foreign
Secretary
Douglas
Hurd
of
his
decision
during
the
EU
Summit
in
Essen
at
the
weekend
But
while
he
sounded
emphatic
about
not
standing
for
President
in
his
broadcast
on
French
TV
last
night
some
senior
British
diplomats
believe
his
decision
may
not
be
irrevocable
Mr
Delors
claimed
he
had
done
a
good
job
as
President
of
European
Union
You
just
have
to
look
at
the
way
the
British
press
has
attacked
me
he
added
with
a
smile
French
socialists
seeing
a
winning
presidential
campaign
in
disarray
and
without
a
credible
alternative
candidate
are
expected
to
put
pressure
on
Delors
to
reconsider
his
decision
to
back
down
Delors
who
rose
from
lowly
bank
trade
union
official
to
the
most
powerful
man
in
Europe
said
last
night
I
will
no
doubt
be
criticised
but
I
hope
the
French
people
will
understand
He
said
a
campaign
would
oblige
him
to
make
promises
he
would
not
be
able
to
fulfil
because
he
would
have
to
work
with
a
conservative
parliament
But
there
is
a
belief
that
Mr
Delors
may
be
receptive
to
arm
twisting
by
the
French
Socialist
Party
early
next
year
and
stand
after
all
By
pulling
out
of
a
race
he
was
never
officially

Rebels

HUNDREDS
of
former
Red
Army
tanks
rolled
to
war
yesterday
as
the
Kremlin's
patience
with
the
breakaway
mafia-ridden
enclave
of
Chechnya
snapped
The
invasion
order
was
given
by
Russian
leader
Boris
Yeltsin
from
his
hospital
bed
in
Moscow
where
he
is
recovering
from
a
nose
operation
Last
night
fears
of
carnage
were
rising
as
thousands
of
Russian
troops
surrounded
the
Chechen
capital
of
Grozny
which
translates
as
Terrible
miles
south-east

Yeltsin
demanded
his
army
be
in

to
storm
Grozny
today
third
anniversary
of
the
Soviet
Union's

He
gave
the
Chechens
four
days

lay
down

The
West
turned
a
blind

offensive

Yeltsin
has

sort

But
Yeltsin's
former
liberal
allies
in
Russia
strongly
rebuked
him
for

Three

LABOUR
called
last

for

Shadow

Secretary
Jack
Straw
blasted
Tory
claims
that
his
party
were
attacking
the
Queen
Mr
Straw
told
the
Daily
Mirror
The
changes
ought
to
strengthen
the
monarchy
for
the
future
not
weaken
it
The
monarchy
will
survive
but
it
is
going
through
a
period
of
change
It
should
be
a
monarchy
which
symbolises
a
classless
society
and
one
which
is
less
elaborate
Labour
plan
to
strip
hereditary
peers
of
their
right
to
sit
and
vote
in
the
House
of
Lords
Mr
Straw
said
that
would
help
end
Britain's
class-ridden
society
I
believe
it
will
also
change
people's
views
of
the
monarchy
he
said
There
would
no
longer
be
a
large
number
of
people
who
take
a
direct
part
in
Government
by
sitting
in
the
Lords
simply
because
they
are
their
fathers
sons
Labour's
plans
are
spelled
out
in
tonight's
BBC1
Panorama
programme
Mr
Straw
told
Panorama
If
we
have
a
monarchy
with
a
more
limited
role
as
a
symbol
of
a
classless
society
without
a
hereditary
House
of
Lords
you
don't
need
the
current
quite
substantial
number
of
members
of
the
royal
family
performing
official
duties
It
could
probably
be
around
five
or
six
Yesterday

Straw's

Ministers

Trade

Heseltine
declared
They
have

figure

its
head
Social
Security
Secretary
Peter
Lilley
accused
Labour
of
pandering
to
its
left-wing
activists
But
Mr
Straw
hit
back
The
changes
we
are
talking
about
do
not
necessarily
spell
the
end
of
the
monarchy
not
for
a
second
but
it
does
mean
the
monarchy's
role
will
end
up
being
redefined
Mr
Straw
is
convinced
the
next
Labour
Government
would
still
be
Her
Majesty's
Government
and
the
monarch
would
continue
to
give
the
Queen's
Speech
He
said
Ministers
must
stop
using
the
Queen's
name
the
royal
prerogative
to
flout
the
wishes
of

Straw
added
This
is
not
about

power
away
from

Queen

Politicians

no
one
above

keep

Harold

said
ending
the
right
of
hereditary
peers
to
vote
in
the
Lords
would
leave

Queen

role
He
said
What
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
we
want
a
fully-fledged
republic
or

family
You
can't

both
Mr
Brookes-Baker
warned
of
the
dangers
in
adopting
a
Scandinavian
style
monarchy
and
pointed
to
the
example
of
Sweden
Other
Scandinavian
monarchs
have
some
official
duties
but
the
King
of
Sweden
does
not
even
open
Parliament
he
said
What
is
the

in

It

have
a
republic

God

rethink
AN
UNHOLY
row
broke
out
yesterday
over
a
new
politically-correct
Bible
God
the
Father
has
become
our
Father-Mother
in
Heaven
Jesus
is
no
longer
the
Son
of
Man
but
the
Human
One
Any
references
to
women's
servitude
to
men
have
been
scrapped
So
too
have
lines
equating
darkness
with
evil
in
case
they
could
be
classed
as
racist
In
Thessalonians
the
Jews
who
killed
both
the
Lord
Jesus
and
the
prophets
has
been
altered
to
those
who
killed
Remarks
about
disabled
people
are
also
taboo
Even
God's
right
hand
has
become
mighty
hand
in
the
new
Good
Book
published
by
the
Oxford
University
Press
but
aimed
at
the
politically
sensitive
American
market
Nonsense

after

shot

appears
to

that
there
were
serious

But
he
was
unwilling
to
take
responsibility

doing
anything

After
visiting

jail

New

she
wrote
to
him
protesting
that
prisoners
wore
their
own
clothes
and
made
international
phone
calls
and
warders
went
shopping
for
them
On
March
the
Home
Secretary
replied
The
surroundings
were
designed
to
compensate
to
some
extent
for
the
regime
But
after
the
breakout
he
was
saying
publicly
It
is
quite
wrong
to
suggest
that
there
was
a
policy
of
treating
IRA
prisoners
any
differently
from
other
prisoners
I
do
not

accept
there
is
anything
remotely

appeasement

the
breakout
a

scandal
struck

b
of
Semtex
explosive
had
been
smuggled
into

Lady
Olga
said
last
night
It
was
more
like
a
hotel
Warders
were
being
sent
out
to
run
errands
for
people
who
were
often
very
rich
successful
criminals
I
felt
this
was
very
wrong

JOHN
Major
suffered
a
huge
political
snub
last
night
as
Bill
Clinton
refused
to
meet
him
over
the
fate
of
British
troops
in
Bosnia
The
blow
at
an
international
defence
meeting
in
Budapest
plunged
the
so-called
special
relationship
between
Britain
and
America
to
a
new
low
British
officials
who
tried
to
fix
up
a
meeting
admitted
last
night
that
the
best
Mr
Major
can
hope
for
is
a
chat
if
he
bumps
into
Mr
Clinton
They
may
meet
in
the
corridor
and
have
time
for
a
brief
chat
but
there
will
be
no
formal
meeting
said
a
spokesman
The
US
president
has
only
a
few
hours
in
Hungary
but
is
thought
to
want
to
set
a
meeting
with
Russian
premier
Boris
Yeltsin
instead
One
angry
British
official
said
He
seems
to
be
able
to
find
time
for
Yeltsin
but
not
for
us
The
insult
comes
as
the
crisis
in
Bosnia
deepens
with
the
lives
of
British
troops
on
the
ground
at
risk
Foreign
Secretary
Douglas
Hurd

out

Defence

Malcolm

today
for

meeting
with
British
UN

Sir
Michael
Rose
And
as
Britain
and
America
appear
increasingly
at
odds
Lieutenant-General
Rose
pleaded
for
a
solution
to
the
mounting
conflict
There
is
a
pressing
need
for
political
action
and
a
resolution
of
the
problem
he
said
Britain
and
France
fear
a
bloodbath
risking
their
troops
lives
while
Mr
Clinton
faces
Senate
pressure
to
lift
the
arms
embargo
on
the
Bosnian
Moslems
Mr
Hurd
warned
at
the
weekend
that
British
forces
will
have
to
be
pulled
out
before
any
lifting
of
the
arms
embargo
He
said
it
was
only
a
matter
of
weeks
before
action
had
to
be
taken

were
released
near
Gorazde
after

A

erupted
yesterday
over
that
Labour
wants
to
strip
the
Queen
of
her
political
powers
The
party
accused
a
Sunday
newspaper
of
concocting
a
story
over
their
proposals
And
Shadow

Secretary
Jack
Straw
made
it
clear
yesterday
that
neither
he

his

abolition

But
he
was
unrepentant
for
raising
the
issue
to

He
confirmed
that
Labour

Mr

talks

He
also
criticises
Prince
Charles

being
too
strident

his

on

Tory

claimed
that
Labour
is

Mr
Straw
calls
for
the
role
of

monarchy
to
be
redefined
He
says
The
monarchy
is
caught
at
a
crossroad
between
whether
it
continues
at
the
apex
of
a
very
hierarchical
class
system
in

society
or
whether
it
moves
over

be

a

Social
Security

accused

trying
to
appease

left-wingers
And
constitutional

Harold

Michael
Heseltine
President
of
the
Board
of
Trade
said
Labour
had
descended
to
undermining
the
very
fabric
of
our
political
constitution
The
Queen
as
head
of
the
state
the
armed
forces
the
Church
of
England
and
of
the
Government
has
in
theory
enormous
powers
But
in
practice
these
are
restricted
mainly
to
advisory
and
ceremonial
roles
The
Sovereign's
role
involves
summoning
suspending
and
dissolving
Parliament
and
giving
Royal
Assent
to
Bills
passed
by
Parliament
She
also
appoints
important
office-holders
such
as
ministers
judges
bishops
and
governors
and
confers
peerages
knighthoods
and
other
honours
The
monarch
appoints
a
prime
minister
by
convention
the
leader
of
the
party
that
can
secure
a
majority
in
the
Commons
It
is
a
power
that
could
become
particularly
important
in
the
case
of
a
hung
Parliament
However
as
the
Queen
hands
the
power
to
her
ministers
and
acts
on
their
advice
in
practice
the
royal
prerogative
powers
are
exercised
by
Ministers
Mr
Straw
wants
the
Queen
to
be
stripped
of
her
remaining
constitutional
power
as
Head
of
State
And
he
argues
for
cuts
in
the
Royal
List
excluding
even
the
Queen
Mother
Only
the
Queen
Prince

Former

He
rapped
his

In

it

He
said
The

We

payments

Former

said
To

been
getting
kickbacks
for

The
sums
involved
are
colossal
well
in

market
pay

bungs

fix-it
fees

thundered
I
have
not
profited
from
any
transfers
and
it's
important
that
is
made
clear
But
it
has
been
alleged
that
he
admitted
to
the
tax
authorities
that
he'd
received
the
cash
although
the
money
was
subsequentlyrepaid
to
Arsenal
Last
year
the
Inland
Revenue
got
wind
of
allegations
about
transfer
back-handers
In
recent
months
four
Premier

clubs
agreed
to
pay
six-figure
sums
in

tax
rather
than
face
prosecution

it

We

the

What
you're
getting
is
a

show
of
the

quality

anything
goes
We

you'll
be

happy
We
spoke
to
vice
madam
Michaela
Hamilton
from
Bullwell
Notts
who
arranged
girls
for
a
Hudson
orgy
at
the
Sanam
curry
house
in
Stoke
She
recalled
We'd
brought
along
a
saddle
and
some
horsey
props
and
by
the
end
after
most
of
the
punters
left
Alan
got
stuck
in
He
was
wearing
a
saddle
and
blinkers
One
of
the
girls
was
riding
him
round
the
stock
room
He
met
me
a
couple
of
weeks
earlier
at
a
hotel
and
said
he
wanted
some
girls
to
put
on
a
show
He
had
a
few
drinks
and
started
getting
frisky
so
we
went
up
to
a
room
and
had
some
fun
He
paid
me
for
sex
but
he
wasn't
up
to
the
job
Prostitute
Donna
who
said
she
was
Michaela's
sister
went
on
I
got
on
his
back
and
he
galloped
round
the
room
He
had
sex
with
a
couple
of
girls
that
night
Hudson
is
divorced
from
his
wife
Maureen
He
also
left
his
lover

Pam

and
claims
she
has
been
saddled
with
a
string
of
debts
from
Hudson
and
his
company
Lifetime
UK
Hudson
set
up
Lifetime
UK
Ltd
as
a
charity
fundraiser
in
He
said
sporting
stars
would
take
part
in
projects
to
benefit
good
causes
After
persuading
charities
to
let
him
use
their
names
he
printed
competition
tickets
and
girls
sold
them
all
over
the
country
But
Joe
Osborne
year-old
chairman
of
the
Burton
and
South
Derbyshire
Multiple
Sclerosis
Society
said
He
is
despicable
and
deplorable
he
caused
me
huge
problems
In
February
I
was
told
the
charity
would
get
monthly
cheques
of
several
hundred
pounds
each
if
I
gave
our
name
to
the
scheme
I
was
told
Hudson
would
sell
tickets
with
the
offer
of
joint
ownership
of
a
race
horse
as
a
prize
I
thought
the
charity
would
benefit
and
I
trusted
him
because
he
was
a
famous
sports
personality
How
wrong
could
I
be
They
used
our
name
and
registered
charity
number
on
the
tickets
and
probably
sold
thousands
We
only
ever
got
one
cheque
for
a
measly
That
was
the
last
I
heard
from
them
I
had
calls
from
all
over
the
country
and
from
the
Charity
Commission
asking
me
what
was
going
on
We'd
love
to
get
our

on
him
Racehorse
owner
Reg
Hollinshead
leased
Hudson
a
two-year
old
filly
for
the
competition
Reg
of
Rugeley
Staffs
said
That
season
the
horse
won
twice
earning
around
but
I
never
heard
if
there
was
a
winner
of
the
competition
I've
no
idea
what
happened
to
the
money
In
another
promotion
for
the
Douglas

Hudson
sold
more
than
worth
of

Hudson
who
joined
Chelsea
in
as
an
year-old
boy
wonder
left

unpaid
bills

bust
He
still
owes
rent
on
an

at
Brookhouse

Uttoxeter
Staffs
Last
night
he
tried
to
blame
his
partner
for
the
sex
party
offer
He
said
Peter
is
skint
He
needs
off
you
He
set
the
whole
thing
up
I
don't
get
involved
with
prostitutes
I
have
two
big
jobs
in
football
management
coming
up
I've
met
these
girls
twice
The
time
before
was
for
five
minutes
I've
never
slept
with
one
of
them
I
was
with
my
son
in
the
Sanam
restaurant
and
we
left
early
I
have

of

who'll
back
me

I'm
not
a

I
don't

that
I

You'll

The
charity
business
was
all
wrapped
up
by
my
accountants
months
ago
I've
not
received
any
letters
recently
from
the
Charity
Commission
Hugh
Rogers
of
the
watchdog
Charity
Commission
said
We
received
complaints
about
Mr
Hudson
and
his
company
We
are
still
searching
for
how
much
money
was
involved
and
who
benefitted
If
anyone
has
any
information
we
would
love
to
hear
from
them
Later
an
emotional
Hudson
phoned
the
News
of
the
World
from
the
Rose
of
Denmark
public
house
in
London's
East
End
and
said
Leave
a
message
for
your
reporter
I
need
him
to
help
me
That
should
be
your
job
as
pressmen
rather
than
trying
to
slaughter
people
I've
found
out
a
couple
of
things
about
him
If
he
wants
to
try
and
wreck
my
life
I've
got
his
home
number
Exactly
what
he
does
to
me
I'll
do
to
him
I've
got
a
lot
of
friends
in
high
places
in
newspapers
I'm
not

as

If

BRITISH
aid

Don
Reid
has
relived
his
nightmare
six-day
ordeal
hiding
out
in
the
African
jungle
The
year-old
former
SAS
squaddie
had
no
food
water
or
equipment
and
was
dressed
in
just
a
T-shirt
and
shorts
I
went
through
fear
like
I'd
never
felt
before
he
says
Don
reunited
with
his
family
on
Friday
had
been
taking
part
in
the
relief
effort
to
help
Rwandan
refugees
in
Zaire
and
went
on
the
run
after
the
grain
truck
he
was
driving
was
fired
on
by
Zairean
troops
There
was
chaos
AK47s
firing
and
then
a
machine
gun
opened
up
he
says
It
was
like
the
Second
World
War
there
were
bullets
everywhere
Don
who
won
a
United
Nations
Peacekeeping
Medal
after
a
tour
of
duty
in
Cyprus
with
Three
Para
in
recalls
Once
in
the
bush
I
ran
through
cane
plantations
and
high
grass
After
five
minutes
I
was
getting
really
tired
I
concealed
myself
in
a
thicket
and
stayed
there
all
day
as
the
heavy
firing
went
on
I
could
hear
soldiers
walking
past
I
thought
The
missus
isn't
going
to
like
this
Don
decided
to
head
for
the
mountains
in
the
west
where
he
knew
Oxfam
had
a
base
but
only
after
dark
did
he
venture
out
It
took
me
one
and
a
half
hours
to
cover
ten
yards
of
the
bush
he
says
Even
as
the
sun
began
to
rise
gunshots
were
still
rattling
through
the
undergrowth
Suddenly
Don
found
himself
up
to
his
knees
in
swamp
mud
I
was
at
a
stream
about
to
feet
wide
he
says
I
thought
I
could
wade
across
but
it
turned
out
to
be
deep
So
deep
that
two
hippos
surfaced
I
staggered
fell
in
and
had
to
climb
out
again
I
was
soaking
wet
As
the
sun
got
warmer
the
flies
started
coming
out
I
don't
know
what
kind
of
flies
they
were
but
they
were
far
worse
than
any
mosquito
Each
time
they
bit
it
was
like
having
a
needle
stuck
into
you
I
was
close
to
despair
Occasionally
Don
heard
a
search
helicopter
thunder
overhead
and
knew
people
were
looking
for
him
But
he
could
not
show
himself
in
case
his
enemies
spotted
him
On
the
third
day
the
thirst
began
Don
recalls
I
started
licking
the
dew
off
leaves
I
spent
much
of
the
day
in
a
very
dense
jungle
with
a
lot
of
thorns
My
legs
were
cut
to
ribbons
and
it
got
very
painful
By
the
fourth
day
Don
was
racked
with
fatigue
He
had
not
eaten
or
drunk
anything
and
what
little
sleep
he
could
snatch
was
fitful
He
says
Things
got
so
bad
I
had
to
drink
so
I
urinated
in
my
hand
and
wet
my
mouth
with
it
Day
five
brought
the
hunger
pains
I
was
very
weak
Don
says
I
found
some
berries
which
looked
like
small
grapes
and
there
were
ape
droppings
with
bits
of
these
berries
in
them
Foul
So
I
thought
If
they're
good
enough
for
them
they're
good
enough
for
me
I
ate
handfuls
of
them
as
I
went
along
I
also
found
a
stagnant
pool
in
volcanic
rock
I
cleared
the
algae
out
and
let
the
sediment
settle
before
drinking
It
tasted
foul
I
felt
sick
and
my
stomach
was
cramped
As
the
sun
rose
on
Don's
sixth
and
final
day
he
was
at
an
all-time
low
He
could
see
the
mountains
he
had
been
heading
for
but
the
thickest
most
dangerous
undergrowth
lay
before
him
It
was
soul-destroying
he
says
It
was
like
someone
was
putting
obstacles
in
my
way
I
had
an
image
of
me
dying
in
that
place
and
my
wife
would
never
have
known
what
had
happened
to
me
I
was
hallucinating
I
closed
my
eyes
and
saw
hamburgers
it
was
like
living
in
a
nightmare
Then
suddenly
I
was
on
a
dirt
track
Villagers
found
him
and
led
him
to
the
Oxfam
base
Back
at

Don
hugged

Lynn

Nina
Ian
and
Andrew
Lynn
says
When
I
met
his
plane
at
Heathrow
I
was
shocked
by
how
he
looked
He's
lost
at
least
a
stone
and
a
half
he's
wasted
away
But
words
can't
describe
what
I
felt

asked

Eddie
He
had
a
very
gay
sounding
voice
and
looked
just
like
John
Inman
from
Are

Being
Served
Almost
immediately
he
said
Let's
go
to
the
palace
I
was
nervous
I
assumed
they
would
tap
my
details
into
a
computer
and
Harold
would
find
out
l
was
a
sex
offender
But
he
said
Don't
worry
we

He
seemed
very

Grey-haired
Lodge
who
has
been
Margaret's
butler
since
November
last
year
escorts
him
to
a
side
gate
off
Kensington
Church
Street
The
wrought
iron
gates
are
patrolled
by
two
police
guards
in
a
sentry
box
and
protected
by
mounted
infra-red

even
jokes
Hey
look
Harold
we're
on
candid
camera
The
bespectacled
pervert
whose
arms
are
covered
in
tattoos-
recalls
now
When
I
saw
the
two
uniformed
officers
I
thought
There's
no
way
I'll
get
in
But
they
just
said
to
Lodge
Good
evening
Harold
and
let
us
go
through
the
two
barriers
Lodge
told
them
I'm
just
taking
a
guest
in
and
they
said
All
right
I
said
to
one
of
the
policemen
Oh
it's
cold
tonight
He
laughed
It's
all
right
for
you
you'll
be
in
the
warm
soon
We
walked
about
yards
down
a
tarmac
road
on
which
several
cars
were
parked
Everything
was
so
quiet
and
tranquil
When
we
were
through
I
said
That
was
simple
and
he
told
me
to
shut
up
There
were
old-fashioned
iron
street
lamps
and
beautiful
gardens
around
the
palace
It
was
certainly
nicer
than
Pentonville
Prison
where
I'd
been
banged
up
Harold
even
pointed
out
Princess
Margaret's
apartments
where
he
worked
He
was
so
open
I
couldn't
believe
it
To
avoid
the
Royal
Family's
personal
security
staff
the
pair
deliberately
go
a
long
way
round
to
Lodge's
quarters
which
are
at
the
end
of
a
row
of
residences
running
parallel
to
and
linked
to-the
palace
itself
pm
Safely
inside
the
butler's
suite
Lodge
takes
Houghton's
coat
and
makes
him
a
cup
of
tea
Describing
the
suite
Houghton
says
now
It
was
like
a
bungalow
with
a
big
dark
oak
front
door
and
was
very
posh
inside
There
were
two
expensive
looking
cut
glass
ashtrays
on
a
small
table
next
to
a
big
grey
sofa
There
was
a
small
inch
Matsui
television
on
a
ridiculously
big
TV
stand
He
had
big
red
curtains
in
the
lounge
which
were
shut
and
a
coffee
table
piled
up
with
magazines
and
newspapers
But
he
wanted
to
get
straight
down
to
business
and
grabbed
my
private
parts
before
I'd
even
started
my
tea
He
showed
me
where
the
bedroom
was
It
had
a
white
patterned
duvet
and
a
big
double
bed
Beside
it
there
was
a
large
green
old-fashioned
dial
telephone
Lodge
came
into
the
room
and
stripped
off
and
we
lay-on
the
bed
After
detailing
their
sex
acts
Houghton

Prime

rejects
call

PREMIER
John

dismissed
calls
last

to
bring
his
Tory
rebels
back
into

immediately
He
made
clear
their

BRITAIN'S
BIGGEST
WINNER
One
punter
gets
m
BRITAIN'S
biggest
ever
prizewinner
was
last
night
celebrating
a
mind-boggling
MILLION
jackpot
on
the
National
Lottery
The
mystery
punter
held
the
only
ticket
to
match
all
six
numbers
The
massive
payout-around
six
times
bigger
than
Britain's
record
pools
win-was
confirmed
within
an
hour
of
the
live
draw
on
BBC1
The
win
was
against
all
odds
because
the
six
numbers
were
above
They
were
and
Even
the
bonus
number
was
high
Another
ten
winners
were
counting
bumper
payouts
too
collecting
for
five
correct
numbers
plus
the
bonus
ball
A

There's

winner
We

know
who
it
is
at
this
stage
where
the
ticket
was
bought
or
whether
it's
a
man
or
a

The
important
thing
is
that
somebody
out
there
has
suddenly
become
incredibly
rich...it
must
be
one
of
the
largest
Christmas
presents
in
history
The
winner
is
so
wealthy
he
could
soon
shoot
into
the
list
of
Britain's
richest
people
With
careful
investment
his
win
will
rapidly
be
worth
million
That
would
give
him
a
fortune
matching
rock

David
Bowie
motor

boss
Frank
Williams
movie

Roger

and
Manchester

Last

Camelot

Officials

An

his

So

the
mountain

spend

Investment
managers
will
be

where
to

But
even
with

is
the
chance

David

Top

We're

There
was
an
amazing
dust-up
Sadly
it's
a
very
real
possibility
that
Ronnie
might
now
be
kicked
out
of
the
Championship
He
added
I
find
it
ridiculous
that
Ronnie's
friend
was
asked
to
leave
because
he
was
wearing
jeans
but
nonetheless
it
does
not
justify
hitting
anybody
A
statement
later
issued
by
the
World

Billiards

Association
said
A
report
has
been
made
and
pending
further

we

make
at

But
the

indicated
that

O'Sullivan's

Shout
But
Joshua
who
had
been
sitting

in

was
missing
In
desperation
he
waded
in
the
ditch
calling
his

name
Sean
a
landscape
gardener
said
I
just
started
thrashing
around
in

looking
for
him
I
heard
someone
shout
He's
behind
you
and
turned
to
see
his
cardigan
sticking
out
of
the
water
I
pulled
at
it
and
there
he
was
and
I
lifted
him
onto
the
side
The
dad
a
trained
first-aider
then
gave
the
child
heart
massage
as
another
motorist
Alex
Hardy
gave
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation
Eventually
the
baby
coughed
and
began
to
cry
All
this
stuff
came
out
of
his
mouth
and
he
started
crying
and
I
knew
then
he
was
all
right
and
I
just
fainted

Sean

a

eye
Samantha
Lee
who
spotted
Joshua's
cardigan
in

water
said
I
watched
as
they
tried
to
save
him
and
then
heard
him
cough
Mrs
Lee
of
Lakenham

added
That
cough
was
really

I
picked
him
up
and
cuddled
him

Amazing
escape
as

falls
from
jet
It
just

driver
LORRY
driver
Phil
Caine
had
a
miracle
escape
yesterday
when
a
jumbo
jet's
emergency
chute
snapped
off
and
crashed
ft
to
the
ground
missing
his
cab
by
feet
The
Virgin
Airways
plane
had
just
taken
off
from
London's
Heathrow
airport
for
New
York
when
a
metal
panel
burst
open
and
the
ft
by
ft
rubber
lifesaver
smashed
into
a
tree
next
to
the
flat-bed
truck
Mr
Caine
believed
to
be
a
divorced
Australian
in
his
late
s
was
unloading
crates
of
French
wine
in
Slough's
McKay
trading
estate
Berks
when
the
chute
struck
A
spokesman
for
Mr
Caine's
haulage
firm
said
he
had
not
been
injured
but
was
last
night
sent
to
his
home
in
Aylesbury
Bucks
to
recover
from
the
shock
instead
of
driving
over
to
Belgium
as
had
been
planned
Incredibly
the
jet
with
on
board
was
in
mid-Atlantic
before
the
captain
aborted
the
flight
and
returned
to
safely
land
the
at
Heathrow
An
airline
spokeswoman
said
Nobody
aboard
was
ever
in
any
danger
The
chute
was
housed
in
a
compartment
just
above
the
right
wing
next
to
the
starboard
emergency
exit
Airline
officials
could
not
explain
last

how
the
lock
had
burst
open
or
why
the
flight
crew
did
not
immediately
detect

This

Pub

Martin
Higgins
said
There
was
a

big
yellow
tarpaulin
on
the
back
of
the
lorry
but
it
didn't
look
as
if
it
had
been
badly
damaged
I
think
the
driver
had
been
returning
from
a
trip
and
was
off-loading
the
lorry
when
it
was
hit
A
team
of
engineers
waited
for
Virgin
flight
VS
to
touch
down
safely
and
repair
the
damage
An
immediate
investigation
was
underway
last
night
to
discover
how
it
happened
Passengers
were
being
put
up
in

overnight
and
flown

Woman's

fear
over

A
WOMAN
is
living
in
fear
after
seeing
her
twin
sisters
struck
down
with
the
human
form
of
mad
cow
disease
Margaret
Ammon
watched
helplessly
as
one
sister
Joan
Stapleton
died
from
CJD
in
Now
Joan's
identical
twin
Betty
Bottle
is
fighting
the
same
disease
Margaret
is
married
to
a
herdsman
and
lives
on
a
farm
hit
by
four
cases
of
BSE
Her
sisters
are
thought
to
be
the
closest
relatives
in
Britain
to
succumb
to
CJD
But
doctors
believe
the
most
likely
cause
is
genetic
and
Third
sister's
nightmare
has
nothing
to
do
with
eating
beef
It
has
always
been
thought
that
cases
of
CJD
in
older
people
like
Joan
and
Betty
were
likely
to
be
genetically
linked
Fears
over
the
mad
cow
connection
focus
on
recent
younger
victims
such
as
the
suspected
year-old
sufferer
in
Glasgow
Even
so
researchers
are
looking
closely
at
the
cases
of
Joan
and
Betty
to
determine
whether
there
may
be
a
BSE
connection
They
lived
and
worked
together
for
much
of
their
adult
life
and
shared
many
meals
They
may
have
eaten
the
same
infected
beef
or
come
into
contact
with
infected
cattle
while
visiting
the
farm
where
Margaret
lives
An
average
of

people
die
of

in
Britain
every
year
so
on
the
face

it
the
chances
of

disease
are
millions
to
one

at
a
laundry
near

Betty
is
among

people
from

started
to
show
symptoms
months
ago
She
is

bedridden

contortions
and

are
horrific
Whether
or
not
doctors
are
able
to
pinpoint
the
cause
of
the

illness
as
genetic
or
BSE-linked
Margaret
is
living
a
nightmare
Her
husband
said
Of

my
wife
is
frightened
about
her
own
health
But
she
would
never
take
a
test
to
discover
if
she
is
also
at

of

CJD

you
She
doesn't

also
exhausted
at
travelling
miles
every
week

said
This
is
an

It's
the
first
case
I've
heard
of

Another

Consultant
neurologist
Dr
Alan
Colchester
who
is
treating
the
Ashford
cases
said
the
most
likely
explanation
was
genetic
One
of
the
reasons
why
there
is
caution
over
jumping
to
the
conclusion
that
CJD
is
transmitted
from
cattle
to

is
the

Deadly
rampage
of
the

surfer
who
pulled
a
rifle
from
his
tennis
bag
and
slaughtered
people
at
random
One
by
one
he
executed
them
in
cold
blood
World's
worst
gun
massacre
THE
bronzed
young
man
who
pulled
into
a
packed
tourist
spot
yesterday
with
a
surfboard
on
top
of
his
car
looked
like
any
other
Aussie
beach
boy
But
minutes
later
he
pulled
an
automatic
rifle
from
a
tennis
bag
and
launched
a
callous
massacre
which
left
at
least
people
dead
and
wounded
The
slaughter
in
Tasmania
is
believed
to
be
the
world's
worst
mass
shooting
Last
night
police
and
rescue
workers
who
had
come
under
fire
themselves
did
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
more
bodies
could
be
found
Their
search
was
hampered
by
the
chaos
following
the
rampage
and
by
nightfall
Last
night
the
gunman
was
still
at
large
after
barricading
himself
in
a
remote
cottage
with
three
hostages
More
than
armed
police
had
surrounded
the
building
Many
of
the
victims
were
shot
indiscriminately
on
the
sunny
Sunday
afternoon
at
Port
Arthur
a
th
century
convict
settlement
which
is
now
a
museum
More
than
Australian
and
foreign
tourists
were
visiting
the
site
miles
from
the
Tasmanian
state
capital
of
Hobart
when
the
gunman
walked
into
the
Broad
Arrow
cafe
took
out
his
gun
and
opened
fire
Witnesses
say
the
killer
cold-bloodedly
lined
up
his
victims
took
careful
aim
and
callously
shot
them
one
by
one
Phillip
Milburn
who
witnessed
the
start
of
the
slaughter
said
He
wasn't
going
bang
bang
bang
bang
It
was
bang
and
then
he'd
pick
someone
else
out
and
line
them
up
and
shoot
them
He
was
a
cold-blooded
killer
with
a
gun
that
was
meant
to
kill
people
The
gunman
then
went
outside
and
began
firing
at
tourist
buses
in
the
car
park
and
at
motorists
driving
through
the
pay
kiosk
entrance
to
the
museum
Afterwards
he
coolly
got
in
his
car
and
drove
two
miles
to
the
packed
Fox
and
Hounds
pub
Relaxed
lunchtime
drinkers
were
thrown
into
panic
seconds
later
as
he
picked
more
victims
at
random
He
then
calmly
placed
his
weapon
back
in
the
tennis
bag
and
drove
to
a
remote
holiday
guesthouse
where
he
seized
the
hostages
Police
revealed
that
the
man
was
lived
in
Hobart
and
suffered
from
psychological
problems
They
said
members
of
his
family
were
helping
with
siege
negotiations
but
there
were
problems
maintaining
telephone
links
with
the
gunman
Most
of
the
dead
were
Australians
but
two
were
Canadian
tourists
The
nationality
of
another
victim
was
not
known
Several
children
and
a
baby
were
reported
dead
A
witness
heard
him
make
a
remark
about
WASPS
White
Anglo
Saxon
Protestants
seconds
before
the
shootings
The
gunman
muttered
There
are
a
lot
of
WASPS
around
here
there
are
not
many
Japs
Then
he
pulled
the
trigger
Rob
Atkins
a
Sydney
holidaymaker
who
was
less
than
yards
from
the
cafe
when
the
first
shots
were
fired
said
There
was
complete
chaos
because
nobody
knew
what
had
happened
Some
people
were
running
up
the
hill
hysterically
but
others
were
still
dawdling
around
just
looking
at
the
ruins
of
the
convict
colony
thinking
it
was
all
part
of
the
show
It
was
all
a
bit
unreal
Sue
Hobbs
who
works
for
the
Port
Arthur
Historic
Settlement
said
It's
shocking
You're
talking
about
one
of
those
situations
that
no
one
could
ever
imagine
happening
in
their
own
particular
area
Ian
McCausland
editor
of
the
local
Hobart
newspaper
said
a
woman
outside
the
tourist
complex
was
shot
three
times
They
fell
like
ninepins
he
said
It's
appalling
The
carnage
is
horrific
A
car
and
several
buildings
were
set
on
fire
during
the
shootings
Hospitals
in
the
Hobart
area
were
put
on
disaster
alert
as
the
injured
were
either
flown
to
the
city
or
taken
there
by
ambulance
Streets
in
the
centre
were
cordoned
off
to
give
ambulances
free
passage
Extra
staff
were
brought
in
and
the
Royal
Hobart
Hospital
appealed
for
blood
donors
to
come
forward
to
meet
the
demand
for
transfusions
State
Premier
Tony
Rundell
said
All
Tasmanians
and
all
Australians
will
be
sick
at
heart
at
this
massacre
Australian
Prime
Minister
John
Howard
expressed
his
shock
and
disbelief
at
what
he
described
as
senseless
murders
Tasmanian
police
chief
John
Johnson
said
officers
had
not
established
a
motive
for
the
shooting
and
said
Why
he's
done
this
no
one
knows
but
if
he's
done
it
to
make
some
point
in
life
he's
made
that
point
Now's
the
time
to
end
the
siege
and
avoid
any
more
bloodshed
All
I'm
hoping
is
that
the
gunman
will
realise
the
terrible
damage
he
has
done
and
will
give
himself
up
without
any
further
fight
The
police
chief
said
he
believed
the
three
hostages
were
still
alive
several
hours
after
they
were
seized
The
gunman
kept
police
surrounding
the
guesthouse
at
bay
by
taking
pot
shots
at
them
He
also
fired
at
helicopters
taking
the
injured
to
hospital
in
Hobart
A
police
spokesman
said
the
gunman
was
in
a
strong
position
to
defend
himself
because
there
was
water
on
one
side
of
the
building
and
open
land
around
the
rest
He
said
It
makes
it
very
difficult
for
us
to
get
too
close
Police
spokesman
Stuart
Slade
said
negotiations
had
been
hampered
by
a
lack
of
information
about
the
gunman
or
his
motives
Several
shots
have
been
fired
from
the
house
he
added
The
situation
has
been
the
same
for
several
hours
We're
not
making
much
leeway
although
the
negotiators
are
still
attempting
to
communicate
with
this
individual
Mr
Slade
said
it
was
thought
the
hostages
were
the
couple
who
ran
the
guesthouse
and
one
of
their
visitors
All
tourists
had
been
evacuated
from
the
area
and
neighbouring
families
had
been
warned
not
to
go
outside
He
added
It's
a
very
remote
and
isolated
area
John
Major
said
in

SURFER
SLAUGHTER
He
looked
just
like
any
other
beach
boy
till
he
took
out
a
rifle
HE
LOOKED
a
typical
Aussie
beach
boy
as
he
rolled
up
in
his
VW
Beetle
surfboard
strapped
to
the
roofrack
But
suddenly
he
pulled
an
automatic
rifle
from
his
tennis
bag
and
went
on
the
rampage
leaving
at
least
dead
and
injured
including
children
and
a
baby
as
he
sprayed
bullets
into
a
cafe
a
pub
and
tourist
coaches
Last
night
it
looked
as
if
the
death
toll
could
have
risen
further
as
the
gunman
set
fire
to
the
remote
bed-and-breakfast
cottage
where
he
was
holed
up
with
three
hostages
The
killer
was
arrested
but
only
after
several
shots
were
heard
by
the
armed
cops
surrounding
the
building
Senior
officers
had
earlier
admitted
they
were
desperately
worried
for
the
cottage's
elderly
owners
David
and
Sally
Martin
and
the
guest
being
held
by
the
gunman
a
year-old
said
to
have
a
history
of
mental
problems
During
the
hour
siege
he
had
demanded
a
helicopter
but
broke
off
negotiations
when
his
mobile
phone
battery
ran
out
Karen
Jones
who
witnessed
the
day's
massacre
said
It
seemed
he
wanted
to
destroy
everything
in
sight
There
was
a
little
girl
who
had
been
killed
The
mother
was
saying
You
have
to
get
my
baby
to
hospital
quick
quick!
but
she
was
already
dead
The
world's
worst
massacre
by
a
lone
gunman
began
as
the
man
wandered
up
to
the
Broad
Arrow
cafe
in
Port
Arthur
an
old
Victorian
prison
colony
packed
with
hundreds
of
tourists
Blasted
He
chatted
to
people
in
the
lunch
time
queue
forming
outside
remarking
strangely
to
one
man
There
are
a
lot
of
WASPS
White
Anglo-Saxon
Protestants
here
today
but
not
many
Japs
Then
he
wandered
into
the
cafe
pulled
out
his
rifle
and
opened
fire
Diners
were
blasted
out
of
their
seats
as
they
chatted
over
lunch
or
picked
off
one
by
one
as
they
ran
panic-stricken
for
the
door
Hans
Overbeeke
from
Adelaide
said
He
just
shot
them
down
where
they
were
sitting
Some
were
running
away
up
the
hill
and
he
shot
them
too
There
were
just
lots
and
lots
of
bullets
I
heard
about
or
They
were
big
bullets
big
cartridges
were
lying
everywhere
Then
he
flew
into
his
car
and
drove
off
shooting
more
people
Witness
Phillip
Milburn
said
the
gunman
carefully
lined
up
his
victims
and
shot
them
one
by
one
He
wasn't
just
going
bang
bang
bang
bang
It
was
bang
and
then
he'd
pick
someone
else
out
and
line
them
up
and
shoot
them
He
was
a
coldblooded
killer
A
nurse
called
Lynne
from
Melbourne
hid
behind
a
wall
as
bullets
ricocheted
nearby
When
they
stopped
she
dashed
to
help
the
wounded
She
said
Behind
a
bus
there
were
three
victims
the
driver
dead
one
lady
shot
in
the
back
and
one
lady
shot
in
the
neck
She
went
on
to
the
cafe
and
in
a
state
of
shock
herself
gave
first
aid
to
survivors
and
made
tea
until
the
police
arrived
With
the
cafe
floor
flooded
with
blood
and
the
cries
of
the
injured
and
dying
in
his
ears
the
gunman
had
coolly
turned
and
wandered
out
firing
indiscriminately
He
got
back
in
his
car
still
shooting
as
he
drove
then
headed
for
the
Fox
and
Hounds
hotel
It
was
also
crowded
with
tourists
enjoying
lunch
or
having
a
drink
And
minutes
later
it
was
also
filled
with
the
same
awful
carnage
the
dead
and
dying
lying
on
the
floor
and
the
screams
of
those
who
survived
Horrified
The
pub
was
where
most
of
the
victims
died
said
police
The
place
was
packed
He
had
a
lot
of
targets
Les
Gore
owner
of
the
Fox
and
Hounds
watched
as
the
gunman
shot
a
girl
through
the
heart
as
she
got
out
of
her
car
Mr
Gore
said
We
were
all
dumbfounded
I
was
horrified
I
got
some
bandages
and
we
helped
them
One
of
the
women
was
in
very
bad
shape
Again
the
gunman
calmly
returned
to
his
car
shooting
at
anyone
he
saw
Then
they
shut
all
the
tollgates
off
blocked
them
off
because
he
just
went
up
there
and
shot
everyone
that
was
coming
in
in
their
cars
said
Karen
Jones
from
the
Tasmanian
capital
Hobart
The
man
fired
into
vehicles
set
at
least
one
car
alight
and
started
fires
in
buildings
A
group
of
elderly
women
on
holiday
from
New
South
Wales
was
attacked
as
their
bus
drove
towards
the
scene
Peter
Ettinghausen
owner
of
a
hotel
nearby
said
the
surfer
stood
in
the
road
and
opened
fire
Luckily
the
driver
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
rapidly
reverse
because
the
road
was
too
narrow
to
U-turn
As
they
drove
back
at
speed
he
started
firing
at
them
Yet
while
the
massacre
continued
many
tourists
still
wandered
around
smiling
and
joking
about
the
sound
effects
Hostages
They
didn't
realise
this
was
for
real
said
Rod
The
rangers
knew
this
wasn't
part
of
any
historic
re-enactment
and
they
herded
us
into
a
cottage
and
locked
us
in
Many
people
now
realising
what
was
happening
outside
were
really
panicking
But
at
least
we
were
safe
in
there
The
gunman
sped
off
again
shooting
out
of
the
window
and
took
his
hostages
in
the
B
Police
said
last
night
that
the
dead

wounded
included

in

BRAVE
Princess
Diana
joined
the
SAS
in
a
live
ammo
battle
and
nearly
went
up
in
flames
when
her
hair
caught
fire
Diana
had
insisted
on
joining
the
elite
regiment
motto
Who
Dares
Wins
when
they
stormed
a
building
at
their
Hereford
headquarters
As
the
troopers
lobbed
flash-bang
stun
grenades
a
stray
spark
landed
in
the
princess's
blonde
locks
sending
smoke
rising
into
the
air
Shaken
Diana
still
shaken
by
crashing
a
Range-Rover
into
a
wall
during
a
mock
assault
screamed
in
terror
to
Prince
Charles
at
her
side
Oh
Charles
my
hair!
My
hair!
It
was
several
seconds
before
anyone
realised
the
danger
Then
an
SAS
man
raced
forward
to
brush
the
singed
tresses
and
lead
the
princess
to
safety
The
drama
came
when
Diana
and
Charles
visited
the
SAS
before
the
break-up
of
their
marriage
It
was
no
ordinary
visit
The
royal
couple
were
there
to
play
the
deadly
serious
role
of
hostages
being
rescued
by
troopers
firing
live
bullets
But
before
they
braved
the
squad's
mm
Koch
and
Heckler
sub-machine
guns
they
joined
an
assault
on
an
embassy
under
siege
A
trooper
who
took
part
told
the
Mirror
Diana
had
asked
to
drive
a
Range-Rover
being
used
in
the
exercise
At
one
point
she
failed
to
brake
in
time
and
hit
a
wall
which
sent
her
shooting
forward
in
her
seat
By
now
we
were
all
around
her
hurling
flash-bangs
which
we
use
to
disorientate
terrorists
The
princess
had
been
warned
to
keep
her
driver's
window
up
for
protection
But
she
left
it
down
and
a
burning
whistler
from
a
flash-bang
landed
in
her
hair
which
started
smoking
She
started
to
beat
the
fire
out
Then
one
of
the
lads
realised
what
had
happened
and
went
to
help
her
Diana
seemed
to
go
into
shock
An
officer
put
his
arm
round
her
to
comfort
her
and
she
was
taken
to
a
quiet
room
to
recover
It
was
quite
a
shock
for
all
of
us
when
we
realised
how
close
we
had
come
to
setting
fire
to
her
As
the
visit
was
secret
Diana
got
her
lady-in-waiting
to
trim
her
hair
back
into
shape
before
she
left
so
no-one
would
realise
what
had
happened
The
next
day
everyone
assumed
she
was
trying
out
a
new
hairstyle
Charles
at
the
controls
of
a
helicopter
ferrying
SAS
men
also
had
his
moment
of
fear
A
trooper
said
As
we
approached
the
siege
area
a
dummy
dressed
in
black
was
thrown
out
of
the
chopper
to
simulate
the
first
of
the
assault
team
landing
on
target
But
Charles
had
been
told
nothing
about
it
and
thought
one
of
the
men
had
fallen
out
Shouted
He
shouted
to
the
co-pilot
Take
the
controls!
I've
lost
somebody!
He
calmed
down
when
he
realised
no-one
was
hurt
Charles
and
Diana
joined
the
SAS
heroes
for
tea
and
coffee
after
the
dramatic
exercise
Then
came
the
real
ordeal
They
were
taken
to
the
regiment's
Killing
House
a
unique
building
where
troopers
simulate
the
rescue
of
hostages
by
killing
dummy
terrorists
using
live
ammunition
The
exercise
was
staged
to
school
the
royals
in
what
would
happen
if
they
were
ever
seized
by
terrorists
and
how
to
react
when
the
SAS
moved
in
Charles
and
Diana
sat
at
a
table
with
two
men
telling
them
what
to
do
They
were
surrounded
by
cut-outs
of
figures
of
gunmen
Suddenly
their
four
rescuers
burst
in
Diana
buried
her
head
in
her
hands
as
the
men
opened
up
and
live
bullets
whistled
round
the
room
Charles
looked
bewildered
at
the
explosion
of
noise
and
action
Our
picture
on
the
following
page
catches
the
dramatic
moment
Afterwards
a
senior
SAS
officer
promised
Charles
If
you
or
any
member
of
your
family
is
taken
by
terrorists
we'll
come
and
get
you
You
are
our
next
King
and
we'll
never
let
you
down
we'll
find
you
wherever
you
are
Another
SAS
man
who
took
part
in
the
operation
said
The
prince
and
princess
behaved
brilliantly
They
were
told
that
if
ever
they
were
taken
hostage
it
was
vital
they
should
know
how
to
react
when
we
come
for
them
The
last
thing
we
want
is
for
a
hostage
to
panic
He
or
she
could
run
into
the
line
of
fire
The
prince
and
princess
were
told
either
to
remain
still
or
hit
the
floor
When
the
four
of
us
burst
in
we
moved
to
our
positions
and
took
out
a
terrorist
target
each
The
noise
is
deafening
for
anyone
not
used
to
it
But
Charles
and
Diana
behaved
exactly
as
they
should
The
princess
found
the
noise
startling
but
she
stayed
in
her
seat
And
the
prince
was
totally
calm
You
only
have
to
remember
when
a
gunman
ran
at
Charles
in
Australia
two
years
ago
The
man
was
firing
blanks
But
the
prince
didn't
know
that
stood
perfectly
still
and
kept
cool
That's
exactly
how
we
need
hostages
to
behave
when
we
go
in
Tower
Before
taking
part
in
the
rescue
joking
Charles
signed
a
typed
letter
which
still
hangs
in
the
mess
at
Hereford
It
reads
Should
this
demonstration
go
wrong
I
the
undersigned
Prince
of
Wales
will
not
commit
B
Squadron
Special
Air
Service
Regiment
to
the
Tower
of
London
Charles
Later
the
SAS
gave
the
couple
two
of
their
black
assault
suits
But
instead
of
the
suits
carrying
the
regiment's
winged
dagger
and
motto
they
were
marked
His
and
Hers
As
she
left
Diana
said
I'm
glad
they're
on

side

down

she
put

Steve

The

the

his

for

expose
a

that

She

Bryan
I

THE
Duchess
of

weaned
herself
off
the
drug
Prozac
just
so
she
could
boost
her
games
with

John
Bryan
it
was
revealed
last
night
The
powerful
tablets
available
only
on

which
leave
many
users
with
a
sense
of

but
they

The
news
of
Fergie's
Prozac
secret
was
broken
by
John
Bryan's
closest

and
business
partner
Allan
Starkie
He
discovered
the
truth
when
she
confessed
that
she
could
not

after
taking
the

Starkie
revealed

She
told
me
her
dresser
Jane
Dunne-Butler
had
forgotten
to
pack
her
Prozac
pills
I
asked
her
if
she
was
going
to
use
the
opportunity
to
try
and
give
them
up
for

She
replied
Yes
I'm
looking

in
the

Bryan
himself
well
knew
the
lengths
to
which
Fergie
would
go
to
get
her
sexual
kicks
He
remembers
the
time
just
after
Andy
and
Fergie
split
that
the
lovelorn
prince
still
devastated
by
the
break-up
of
his
marriage
phoned
her
to

noise
in

background
was

rustle
of
sheets
as
his

continued
making

with
his

Without
turning
a
hair
Fergie
told
Andrew
to
hang
on
while
she
chatted
to
Wyatt
all
the
while
canoodling
with
Bryan
People
may
think
that
sounds
extraordinary
he
explained
But
it
really
seemed
very
normal
at
the
time
He
was
her
husband
after
all
and
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
call
her
and
Steve
Wyatt
was
an
old
friend
keeping
in
touch
They
weren't
to
know
Looking
back
at
that
period
now
it
was
just
a
very
confusing
time
for
her
for
everyone
really
Gross
Bryan
has
only
agreed
to
break
his
silence
on
his
notorious
relationship
with
Fergie
to
clear
the
air
on
his
part
in
her
broken
marriage
He
is
furious
at
allegations
that
he
was
single-handedly
responsible
for
Fergie's
divorce
announcement
just
two
weeks
ago
To
say
that
was
my
fault
to
blame
me
is
a
gross
over-simplification
of
the
way
things
happened
he
told
the
News
of
the
World
When
we
met
for
all
practical
purposes
their
relationship
had
difficulties
This
was
only
a
few
months
before
the
official
announcement
of
the
separation
While
Bryan
was
her
lover
and
financial
guru
Starkie
a
fellow
American
who
ran
the
ill-fated
Oceonics
company
with
him
in
Germany
helped
organise
the
duchess's
day-to-day
life
He
kept
detailed
diaries
and
records
of
his
time
as
Fergie's
unofficial
aide
Fiery
Fergie
and
hotheaded
Bryan
could
find
a
way
to
row
about
almost
anything
he
said
Even
the
way
Bryan
sometimes
ate
could
send
her
off
into
a
rage
Smarties
John's
a
very
enthusiastic
eater
and
he
likes
to
make
a
lot
of
noise
while
he's
doing
it
Starkie
explained
I
remember
once
when
he
was
eating
a
box
of
Smarties
he
was
crunching
each
one
very
loudly
Sarah
just
snapped
in
front
of
everyone
and
told
him
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
She
said
Will
you
STOP
IT
with
those
Smarties
It's
just
disgusting
the
way
you
eat
Close
your
mouth
Starkie
added
John
was
too
surprised
to
reply
but
he
did
as
he
was
told
and
quickly
At
a
garden
party
Fergie
flew
into
a
rage
when
Bryan
swore
at
a
butler
Sarah
overheard
it
and
brought
back
the
butler
and
made
John
apologise
to
him
recalled
Starkie
She
said
we
didn't
treat
staff
that
way
in
England
She
really
tore
his
head
off
and
then
gave
him
a
long
lecture
about
politeness
and
how
to
treat
staff
properly
in
front
of
this
man
Again
John
just
stood
there
and
took
it
Fergie's
belief
in
her
ability
to
manipulate
the
people
around
her
was
bolstered
by
so-called
psychics
and
spiritualists
She'd
spend
at
least
hours
a
week
consulting
with
these
people
and
everything
they
told
her
she
believed
Bryan
told
a
friend
Each
week
Fergie
would
talk
to
fortune-teller
Rita
Rogers
astrologer
Penny
Thornton
and
psychic
Madame
Vasso
She
even
had
a
regular
Friday
phone
appointment
with
an
American
spiritualist
guru
in
Los
Angeles
After
one
consultation
Fergie
was
bursting
with
excitement
when
she
was
told
Prince
Charles
was
to
die
The
Prince
had
earlier
survived
a
brush
with
death
in
an
avalanche
in
the
Alps
But
the
Duchess
was
told
he
would
soon
meet
his
end
in
a
second
avalanche
Bryan
who
is
now
running
an
investment
company
in
Los
Angeles
told
a
friend
She
called
Diana
straight
away
like
a
shot
She
was
really
excited
about
that
one
Nothing
they
ever
told
her
came
true
and
every
time
they
were
wrong
they
had
a
spiritual
explanation
for
it
and
how
they
had
actually
been
right
all
along
Another
tasteless
prediction
had
been
how
the
Queen
Mother
would
pass
away
because
of
problems
with
her
legs
That
was
another
one
that
didn't
come
true
Bryan
told
his
pal
But
she
and
Diana
were
very
interested
in
that
because
they
believed
it
would
affect
the
separations
Their
faith
in
it
was
quite
scary
They
thought
they
would
be
able
to
get
instant
divorces
But
even
with
a
divorce
said
Bryan's
pal
Starkie
Fergie
would
never
have
married
Bryan
She
was
a
woman
who
was
afraid
to
commit
to
anything
in
her
life
he
said
Her
marriage
her
relationship
with
John
her
business
projects
Anything
She
didn't
want
to
let
her
husband
go
but
didn't
want
to
stay
married
to
him
and
at
the
same
time
she
wouldn't
make
John
public
but
wouldn't
let
him
go
either
She
wanted
to
keep
all
the
balls
in
the
air
It
hurt
John
so
badly
that
for
four
years
she'd
ever
acknowledge
him
as
her
boyfriend
her
lover
Fergie
he
said
invented
excuse
after
excuse
to
fend
off
besotted
Bryan's
marriage
proposals
even
playing
on
the
Queen
Mother's
sometimes
frail
health
Another
reason
was
that
Prince
Charles
was
to
renounce
his
right
to
throne
and
Andrew
would
become
Prince
Regent
he
added
John
accepted
every
one
of
them
Whether
he
believed
them
I
don't
know
Bryan
had
been
introduced
to
the
duchess
by
his
old
pal
Steve
Wyatt
then
her
lover
in
November
A
bond
formed
instantly
He
blames
year-old
Andrew's
career
as
a
Royal
Navy
officer
for
the
collapse
of
their
relationship
Bryan
explained
The
distance
between
the
two
of
them
during
their
marriage
was
too
much
to
overcome
Things
can
happen
that
just
get
out
of
everyone's
control
and
that's
certainly
what
happened
here
And
then
there's

DEAD

BABY
LIVES
A
COUPLE
who
believed
their
baby
son
had
died
in
a
car

were
elated
last
night
after
learning
he
was
ALIVE
The
eight-month-old
toddler
had
been
dragged
from
a
water-filled
ditch
and
resuscitated
by
two
motorists
His
hospitalised
parents
only
realised
the
truth
when
staff
at
another
hospital
miles
away
sent
a
message
asking
Can
you
tell
us
what
to
feed
your

on
The
Yorkshire
family's
car
had
been
involved
in
a
pileup
on

Norfolk
The
father
got
his
wife
and
two

out
before
collapsing
into
a
field
In
the
confusion
the
baby
was
believed
dead

he
had

in

taken
to

where
last

he
was

to
be

Casualty

This

FRENZY
OF
THE
PSYCHO
SURFER
A
snack
then
slaughter
THE
blond
surfer
who
brought
carnage
to
Port
Arthur
breezed
into
the
resort
seemingly
without
a
care
in
the
world
He
parked
his
bright
orange
VW
Beetle
surfboard
strapped
on
top
The
year-old
chatted
to
trippers
to
the
Tasmanian
beauty
soot
And
in
the
Broad
Arrow
Cafe
he
chatted
with
tourists
as
they
ate
lunch
together
before
calmly
reaching
down
to
the
tennis
bag
at
his
side
He
pulled
out
a
high-powered
semi-automatic
rifle
stood
up
and
launched
the
biggest
lone
gun
massacre
the
world
has
known
When
he
left
the
cafe
a
few
minutes
later
he
had
turned
it
into
a
slaughterhouse
Blood
covered
the
floor
and
walls
The
injured
were
screaming
Many
were
slumped
on
their
meals
dead
Local
chef
Hayden
Crawford
said
the
dead
included
two
staff
members
one
a
year-old
girl
who
was
a
friend
of
his
Other
bodies
were
bunched
around
the
door
picked
off
one-by-one
as
they
tried
to
flee
The
psycho
surfer
slowly
walked
outside
Some
trippers
ran
away
screaming
aware
of
the
nightmare
that
had
begun
unfolding
One
brave
tour
guide
stood
her
ground
pushing
her
group
into
a
nearby
house
and
telling
them
Lock
the
door
stay
inside
But
others
were
running
towards
the
cafe
Brave
They
had
heard
the
shots
and
believed
staff
at
the
former
British
penal
colony
were
staging
a
fun
re-enactment
Many
just
stood
there
as
the
surfer
turned
his
gun
on
them
and
fired
Again
the
blasts
rang
out
Several
children
were
among
the
dead
Some
were
shot
in
the
back
as
they
tried
to
escape
Next
the
killer
headed
towards
the
nearby
car
park
As
children
and
parents
peered
from
the
windows
of
cars
they
were
sprayed
with
shots
The
surfer
climbed
aboard
three
packed
tourist
coaches
opening
fire
on
each
The
killer
then
stole
a
car
shooting
four
occupants
dead
before
driving
to
the
entrance
gate
where
he
confronted
a
local
woman
and
her
two
children
aged
three
and
six
Mr
Crawford
said
She
pleaded
with
him
but
he
shot
the
lady
and
the
children
and
went
on
to
the
gates
where
he
shot
all
the
staff
The
gunman
then
went
on
to
a
service
station
where
he
shot
a
woman
through
the
heart
and
took
her
male
companion
hostage
bundling
him
into
the
boot
Next
he
headed
for
the
Fox
and
Hounds
Hotel
packed
with
customers
enjoying
a
lunchtime
drink
Outside
two
girls
were
shot
through
the
head
and
two
men
in
the
shoulder
and
arms
Les
Gore
part-owner
of
the
pub
had
heard
gunfire
in
the
distance
and
thought
it
was
someone
shooting
rabbits
Staggered
Horror
dawned
as
four
blood-soaked
victims
staggered
in
as
he
was
serving
counter
meals
The
gunman
followed
and
unleashed
a
hail
of
bullets
around
the
bar
cutting
down
people
where
they
stood
Most
of
his
victims
died
there
Mr
Gore
said
We
were
all
dumbfounded
and
horrified
One
woman
was
in
very
bad
shape
There
were
dozens
of
shots
The
publican
watched
in
disbelief
as
the
gunman
walked
out
and
shot
a
woman
dead
in
an
old
brown
BMW
He
pulled
her
body
out
and
left
it
dumped
on
the
ground
A
group
of
elderly
women
on
holiday
from
New
South
Wales
were
Port
Arthur's
luckiest
visitors
They
were
driving
towards
the
scene
when
they
saw
the
surfer
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
He
turned
and
fired
One
bullet
hit
the
windscreen
and
lodged
in
the
car
body
Peter
Ettinghausen
owner
of
a
nearby
hotel
said
The
road
was
too
narrow
for
a
U-turn
Luckily
the
driver
had
the
presence

mind
to
reverse
rapidly
as
the

on
firing
Back
in
Port
Arthur
police
in
flak
jackets
and
carrying
automatic
weapons
were
pouring
in

hunt
the
killer
A
fleet
of
ambulances
arrived
and
was
ferrying
the
injured
to
hospital
in
Hobart
Scores
of
surgeons
and
nurses
were
drafted
in
to
help
But
as
the
victims
began
to
arrive
a
few
miles
away
the
surfer
was
threatening
to
kill
even
more
By
now
he
was
back
in
his
car
heading
for
the
Seascape
guesthouse
two
miles
away
Injured
It
is
a
two-storey
pink
weather-board
building
with
panoramic
views
of
the
surrounding
open
countryside
He
then
broke
into

hostage
too
Helicopters
were
passing
overhead
carrying
the
injured

Port
Arthur
and
the
Fox

Hounds
to

Soon
shots
were
ringing
out
again

made
the
helicopters
his
latest
target
For
the
police
the
gunmen
could
not
have
chosen
a
worse
place
to
hole
up
The
guest
house
was
difficult
to
attack
because
of
water
behind
open
land
at
the
front
and
little
cover
The
downward
sloping
front
driveway
gave
the
gunman
a
perfect
view
of
anyone
approaching
And
inside
was
an
arsenal
of
weapons
left
there
by
the
owners
son
Every
attempt
by
cops
to
approach
was
being
greeted
with
shots

maniac
set
the
place
on
fire

moved
in

ROYAL
EXCLUSIVE
FERGIE
enjoyed
noisy
sex
romps
in
the
bath
with
lover
John
Bryan
in
earshot
of
embarrassed
household
staff
One
source
said
The
Duchess
would
squeal
her
head
off
They
ignored
the
fact
that
staff
were
around
as
well
as
bodyguards
As
their
affair
became
more
intense
they
got
more
careless
They'd
leave
the
bathroom
window
open
above
the
front
door
There
was
no
doubt
what
was
happening
Their
love-making
was
very
noisy
The
steamy
sessions
took
place
at
Fergie's
former
home
Romenda
Lodge
with
daughters
Beatrice
seven
and
Eugenie
six
just
down
the
corridor
At
first
Bryan
and
Fergie
tried
to
hide
that
they
were
lovers
from
most
staff
But
one
was
given
the
task
of
ruffling
the
sheets
in
the
guest
room
where
Bryan
was
supposed
to
sleep
The
revelations
come
in
the
wake
of
Bryan's
kiss-and-tell
disclosures
from
his
two-year
affair
with
the
Duchess
The
bald
Texan
who
was
Fergie's
financial
adviser
told
the
News
of
the
World
they
had
sex
while
she
giggled

Prince
Andrew
Videos
Bryan's
ex-business
partner
Allan
Starkie
told
how
the
Duchess
came
off
anti-depressant
Prozac
to
boost
her
sex
games
with
Bryan
The
powerful
pills
leave
some
women
unable
to
reach
orgasm
Starkie
also
claims
that
as
the
relationship
bloomed
Beatrice
and
Eugenie
would
go
into
their
mum's
bedroom
and
drag
Bryan
downstairs
to
watch
videos
The
revelations
are
said
to
have
devastated
Fergie
who
has
ordered
lawyers
to
try
to
gag
Bryan
and
Starkie
A
confidante
of
the
Duchess
said
She's
at
an
all-time
low
since
the
divorce
announcement
and
this
is
kicking
her

A

News

World
investigation
into
life
below
stairs
at
the
Palace
discovered
how
these
rowdy
all-night
orgies
often
get
out
of
control
Once
the
Queen
was
even
forced
to
issue
a
royal
command
ordering
servants
to
keep
the
noise
down
At
the
time
advisers
told
her
it
was
just
a
case
of
youthful
high
jinks
Now
we
can
reveal
the
truth
they
were
high
all
right
high
as
kites
on
dope
Our
disturbing
findings
also
show
how
SECURITY

regularly
breached
when
drunken
staff
invite
strangers
inside

sessions
in

HOUSEMAIDS
sneak

and
booze
binges
and
GIRLS
basked
topless
on
Buck
House
roof
until
Prince
Philip
got
an
eyeful
from
his
helicopter
Housemaid
Sylvia
decided
to
expose
the
outrageous
goings-on
after
quitting
her
post
to
warn
unsuspecting
youngsters
lured
into
Palace
jobs
by
the
apparent
glamour
Tempted
The
Queen's
servants
enjoy
one
of
the
swankiest
addresses
in
the
world
at
the
centre
of
all
the
glitz
and
excitement
of
London's
West
End
But
with
meagre
pay
packets
of
around
a
week
most
can't
afford
to
go
out
and
share
the
fun
As
a
result
many
are
tempted
by
drugs
and
booze
inside
the
Palace
and
regularly
end
up
serving
Her
Majesty
while
still
out
of
their
heads
At
least
a
quarter
of
the
staff
I
knew
took
drugs
admittted
Scottish-born
Sylvia
I'd
never
taken
a
thing
before
I
got
my
job
there
Recalling
her
first
brush
with
dope
after
joining
the
royal
staff
in
she
added
I'd
only
been
at
the
Palace
a
few
weeks
when
I
was
invited
to
a
party
on
the
footmen's
floor
There
were
three
other
housemaids
there
We
all
had
a
good
drink
and
then
started
playing
a
forfeit
game
which
involved
knocking
back
glasses
of
booze
in
one
go
Then
someone
produced
some
poppers
and
we
took
them
By
then
I
was
pretty
drunk
and
I
just
joined
in
with
the
others
It
was
my
first
experience
of
drugs
To
be
honest
I
can't
remember
that
much
about
it
But
I
was
shocked
that
it
should
happen
with
the
Queen
and
the
rest
of
the
Royal
Family
sleeping
only
yards
away
Then
I
soon
learned
it's
really
crazy
in
there
Any
excuse
and
they
have
a
party
birthdays
holidays
or
leaving
do's
And
there
are
plenty
of
those!
The
typical
bash
ends
up
with
everyone
totally
drunk
or
stoned
And
there's
always
someone
getting
off
with
someone
they
shouldn't
ending
up
in
their
room
for
the
night
There's
so
much
bedhopping
I
remember
once
some
footmen
had
a
competition
over
who
could
get
off
with
the
most
housemaids
in
one
evening
The
partying
just
went
on
and
on
In
the
end
we
were
sent
a
memo
telling
us
to
keep
our
music
down
That
was
after
a
party
which
went
on
until
am
and
the
Queen
had
heard
it
in
her
bedroom
how
some
housemaids
sneak
down
to
the
nearby
Army
barracks
looking
for
a
good
time
The
soldiers
hold
quite
a
few
discos
and
impromptu
parties
she
said
One
girl
became
very
drunk
and
actually
got
down
to
it
with
this
guardsman
in
the
middle
of
the
ladies
loo
She
didn't
even
bother
going
into
a
cubicle!
At
other
times
soldiers
would
sneak
into
our
quarters
for
more
of
the
same
Not
surprisingly
there
are
quite
a
few
abortions
and
broken
marriages
at
the
Palace
The
blokes
find
it
easy
to
pull
because
girls
outside
are
fascinated
with
the
Palace
and
always
ask
if
they've
spoken
to
the
Queen
There
are
so
many
inter-staff
relationships
and
love
triangles
After
a
Hallowe'en
party
there
was
hell
to
pay
when
one
of
the
housemaids
went
to
bed
with
a
footman
when
she
was
suposed
to
be
dating
a
butler
Scruffy
Then
another
two
girls
had
slanging
matches
because
thev
were
both
chasing
the
same
man
One
of
the
Queen's
footmen
year-old
Barry
Mitford
of
Walsall
confirmed
Sylvia's
drug
revelations
and
admitted
popping
pills
and
smoking
cannabis
I'm
not
taking
as
much
as
I
used
to
he
said
It
was
getting
too
much
But
when
you're
down
these
things
give
you
a
lift
It
makes
you
feel
happy
And
house
porter
Gordon
Curry
revealed
he
was
also
aware
of
drug-taking
at
the
Palace
But
he
said
the
lad
who
used
to
supply
cannabis
had
now
left
Speaking
outside
the
Royal
Mews
scouser
Gordon
still
had
on
his
official
uniform
under
a
scruffy
coat
as
he
confessed
how
he
was
nearly
sacked
and
placed
on
two
years
probation
for
brawling
with
another
employee
Then
he
admitted
he
had
urinated
on
the
Queen's
toilet
at
Balmoral
and
had
to
clean
up
with
one
of
the
hand
towels
Their
former
colleague
Sylvia
claims
drugs
offered
a
temporary
escape
from
the
pressures
of
working
and
staying
in
the
Palace
You
have
to
live
and
breathe
the
job
hours
a
day
she
said
I
had
a
room
on
a
corridor
with
between
and
other
housemaids
The
walls
are
so
thin
and
there
are
so
many
watching
eyes
that
you
can't
keep
a
secret
Staff
are
treated
like
kids
you
can't
make
phone
calls
after
pm
and
visitors
have
to
leave
by
midnight
In
practice
though
lots
of
us
sneaked
people
in
for
the
night
I
didn't
take
drugs
that
often
If
I
was
offered
some
at
a
party
or
if
I
was
really
depressed
I'd
puff
a
joint
out
of
the
window
looking
down
on
the
tourists
below
I
also
did
E's
inside
the
Palace
But
there
were
some
people
whose
rooms
always
smelt
of
dope
And
many
turn
to
alcohol
They're
knocking
back
spirits
before
lunchtime
and
don't
stop
I
dread
to
think
what
that's
doing
to
their
bodies
I
remember
after
one
particularly
drunken
night
a
housemaid
fell
asleep
on
the
sofa
of
the
Queen's
drawing
room
in
Windsor
Castle
She
had
to
be
woken
up
by
a
page
The
servants
also
often
live
it
up
in
local
pubs
one
night
there
was
a
stag-do
for
a
porter
with
strippers
performing
sex
acts
on
some
of
the
staff
According
to
Sylvia
one
old
retainer
gets
his
kicks
in
an
even
weirder
way
This
bloke's
quite
senior
and
has
a
thing
about
the
royal
baths
she
giggled
He
gets
his
pleasure
by
climbing
into
them
His
number
one
target
is
the
Queen's
When
he
knows
the
royals
are
out
of
the
way
he
just
jumps
in
the
tub
and
splashes
around
And
Sylvia
claims
a
secret
Palace
pervert
has
plagued
female
staff
by
stealing
their
underwear
It
cost
us
a
fortune
she
declared
Our
panties
and
bras
were
going
missing
from
the
laundry
and
we
all
reckoned
it
was
some
transvestite
dressing
up
in
his
room
Some
of
the
wildest
staff
parties
are
at
Balmoral
during
the
Queen's
annual
holiday
in
Scotland
Sylvia
told
how
one
drinking
session
ended
with
an
under-butler
shaving
the
eyebrows
off
a
chef
Next
night
the
cook
took
revenge
by
dying
the
butler's
hair
bright
blue
she
recalled
He
had
to
serve
the
Royal
Family
looking
like
that
The
Queen
didn't
say
a
word
although
the
bloke
was
soon
demoted
to
kitchen
porter
Mooning
But
skylarking
was
soon
back
on
the
menu
one
of
the
Queen's
cheeky
chefs
was
even
snapped
mooning
while
preparing
food
at
Balmoral
in
And
there
were
red
faces
when
it
was
revealed
how
housemaids
used
to
sunbathe
topless
high
above
the
Mall
on
the
roof
of
Buckingham
Palace
Everything
was
OK
until
Prince
Philip
got
a
bird's
eye
view
from
his
helicopter
disclosed
Sylvia
I
understand
he
wasn't
bothered
about
it
and
found
it
quite
amusing
But
we
were
still
instructed
to
cover
up
for
fear
of
offending
other
guests
In
Sylvia
finally
had
enough
of
life
with
the
royals
She
admits
the
lack
of
privacy
low
pay
and
being
treated
as
an
underling
got
to
her
But
the
most
worrying
problem
was
the
drugs
she
said
I'm
so
relieved
I
escaped

Britons
on

TWO
Britons
were
among
the
dead
on
the
jet
which
crashed
into
a
Florida
swamp
it
was
revealed
last
night
They
were
named
by
airline
officials
as
Roger
and
Devlin
Loughney
But
as
rescuers
last
night
abandoned
the
search
for
bodies
in
the
alligator-infested
Everglades
there
was
no
other
information
about
them
All
passengers
and
crew
were
killed
when
the
DC9
operated
by
cut-price
airline
ValuJet
crashed
just
a
few
minutes
into
a
flight
from
Miami
to
Atlanta
Georgia
ValuJet
spokesman
Gregg
Kenyon
said
It
appears
the
two
Britons
made
their
reservation
with
a
travel
agency
in
the
United
States
We
have
no
details
of
their
ages
or
their
home
towns
or
their

This
is
the
only
information
we
have

ValuJet

RESCUE
workers
found
almost
no
trace
yesterday
of
an
airliner
which
crashed
with
more
than
passengers
in
alligator-infested
swampland
There
were
no
survivors
and
by
last
night
the
only
clues
discovered
were
baby
clothing
a
photo
album
and
chunks
of
metal
the
size
of
a
baseball
cap
A
fisherman
who
saw
the
DC9
jet
crash
said
After
the
explosion
there
was
no
smoke
It
was
like
nothing
ever
happened
The
plane
belonging
to
cut-price
airline
ValuJet
plunged
into
the
swamp
minutes
after
taking
off
from
Miami
international
airport
Florida
for
Atlanta
The
rescue
teams
armed
with
rifles
for
fear
of
encountering
alligators
or
rattlesnakes
called
off
their
search
for
survivors
Luis
Fernandez
of
the
Metro-Dade
fire
service
said
no
one
could
have
survived
the
difficult
conditions
And
another
rescue

Frank

said
By

Fishermen
Sam
Nelson
who
was
on
a
boat
half
a
mile
from
the
crash
site
said
All
of
a
sudden
the
plane
made
a
right
turn
I
don't
know
what
it
was
doing
It
looked
like
it
was
trying
to
go
back
up
It
was
pretty
low
It
kind
of
turned
sideways
then
it
just
nose
dived
straight
down
into
the
swamp
The
last
thing
I
saw
was
the
tail
end
going
down
There
was
a
big
big
explosion
You
could
hear
the
motor
like
it
was
under
full
power
That
thing
hit
so
hard
you
couldn't
even
see
it
Rescuers
who
struggled
to
get
to
the
scene
found
only
charred
grassland
and
small
pieces
of
debris
scattered
over
a
large
area
The
bulk
of
the
fuselage
was
not
visible
it
had
sunk
beneath
the
murky
waters
of
the
Everglades
There
were
fears
that
sparks
from
boats
could
ignite
fuel
from
the
plane
The
first
divers
to
search
the
area
suffered
chemical
burns
Army
salvage
experts
may
be
called
in
to
construct
temporary
bridges
Part
of
the
marshland
could
be
drained
by
opening
up
sluice
gates
in
the
canals
that
run
through
the
Everglades
in
a
bid
to
recover
the
bulk
of
the
wreckage
Fire
chief
Fernandez
said
the
work
was
emotionally
exhausting
for
his
crews
We
have
not
found
any
survivors
and
we
have
not
found
any
victims
he
said
All
we
have
found
are
articles
of
clothing
and
a
photo
album
They
say
it
is
very
difficult
as
they
have
families
themselves
As
time
goes
by
there
really
is
no
hope
of
finding
any
survivors
There
is
nowhere
for
the
victims
to
hide
It's
a
long
arduous
search
We
don't
know
how
much
of
the
fuselage
has
been
swallowed
up
by
the
mud
It
is
a
very
dangerous
situation
for
the
rescuers
They
have
no
firm
ground
to
stand
on

QUESTIONS
AND
THE
RULES
OJ
finds
that
golf
can
be
a
bit
of
a
trial
THE
questions
were
driven
home
with
the
ruthlessness
of
a
Nick
Faldo
tee-shot
And
fallen
all-American
hero
OJ
Simpson
looked
a
shocked
as
Greg
Norman
as
each
blow
hit
its
target
Did
you
kill
your
wife
Why
was
your
blood
found
at
the
scene
Why
did
you
not
take
the
stand
at
your
trial
OJ
blinked
This
wasn't
his
idea
of
a
gentle
morning's
sport
The
man
controversially
cleared
of
murdering
his
wife
Nicole
made
his
name
in
the
rough
and
tumble
of
American
football
But
here
he
was
getting
far
tougher
treatment
yesterday
on
the
first
tee
of
an
English
golf
course
facing
all
the
crucial
questions
he
was
never
asked
at
last
year's
trial
in
Los
Angeles
Simpson
looked
away
with
a
shocked
expression
on
his
face
Then
he
took
a
battered
kid
glove
out
of
his
pocket
For
a
moment
it
seemed
to
the
watching
crowd
of
fans
and
reporters
as
if
he
was
about
to
show
us
just
as
he
did
in
his
TV
trial
that
the
crucial
evidence
didn't
fit
But
this
glove
fitted
all
right
And
with
a
waggle
of
his
metal-headed
driver
OJ
cracked
the
ball
straight
down
the
first
fairway
at
Selsdon
Park
Surrey
I'm
here
to
play
golf
not
answer
questions
he
said
But
it
was
OJ
or
rather
his
British
agent
Max
Clifford
who
had
invited
the
Press
along
Perhaps
he
thought
the
sight
of
him
playing
a
sport
renowned
for
its
high
standards
of
behaviour
would
boost
his
public
image
When
he
arrived
at
Heathrow
on
Saturday
he
was
greeted
by
chants
of
murderer
Clifford
who
is
looking
after
OJ's
interests
during
his
visit
to
Britain
for
a
TV
interview
with
Richard
and
Judy
today
and
a
confrontation
at
the
Oxford
Union
tomorrow
insisted
My
client
will
not
be
talking
about
his
trial
OJ
is
receiving
a
token
for
his
TV
appearance
but
Granada
has
paid
around
to
Clifford
and
others
for
expenses
Selsdon
Park
is
mentioned
in
the
Domesday
Book
and
its
year
history
includes
visits
from
King
Alfred
and
Henry
VIII
But
it
has
never
witnessed
scenes
like
OJ's
nine
holes
He
was
pursued
at
every
turn
by
a
mob
of
fans
and
journalists
During
his
trial
the
defence
claimed
that
OJ
suffered
from
arthritis
and
was
incapable
of
stabbing
Nicole
and
her
friend
Ronald
Goodman
in
the
driveway
of
her
home
But
there
was
no
sign
of
his
affliction
on
the
golf
course
as
he
belted
the
ball
more
than
yards
It
would
be
churlish
to
accuse
OJ
of
being
economical
with
the
truth
but
he
certainly
managed
to
bend
the
rules
of
golf
He
teed
off
twice
and
men
produced
a
third
ball
which
he
dropped
on
to
the
fairway
He
said
afterwards
he
broke
the
rules
just
for
the
cameras
At
the
end
of
nine
holes
he
claimed
to
have
beaten
his
opponent

Richard
Baker
although

one

card

Jobless
Philip
Wilding
who
had
battled
against

His

refused
to
rule
out
the
possibility
that
the
stress
of
the
case
had
led
to
his
sudden

Last

Richard
was
removed
from

Nottingham
school
He
is
now

away

The

youngster
was
last

said
to

by
his
year-old
father's
death
He
was
being
comforted
at

Mrs

She
said
I

but
obviously
they
are
very

Although
the
couple
regularly
greeted
reporters
with
four-letter
words
at
their
council
house
they
gave
regular
TV

We
will
fight
this
all
the
way
they
vowed
But
little

they
know
that
in
taking
on
the
media
they
would
have
to
face
up
to
their
own
lives
coming
under
close
scrutiny
Within
days
it
emerged
that
Mrs
Wilding
had
been
convicted
of
assaulting
a
council
housing
officer
His
back
injuries
were
so
severe
that
he
has
been
on
sick
leave
ever
since
the
incident
in
and
still
needs
crutches

The
couple
had
already
successfully
appealed
to
an
independent
committee
after
Richard
was
expelled
in
January
for
violence
and
disruptive
behaviour
Six
weeks

the
boy
returned

We

back

Last
time
we
made
a

mistake
We
thought
the
recession
was
nearly
over
we
committed
ourselves
to
tax
cuts
and
then
we
found
the

went
on
We
got
heavily
into

and
we
put
up

I
inherited
the
job
of
putting
up

we
hurt
people
They
remember
those
promises
and
they
remember
the

But
he
said
that
others
now
seemed
to
think
that
all
you
have
got
to
do
is
cut
taxes

You

But
yesterday
Blur's
Damon

put
on

The

side

at

soccer
tournament
in

there
wasn't

lining

had
specified
they

Soccer
Six
because
of
lingering
fears
that
a

might
spark

quickly
knocked

Damon
was

sole
band
member
on

which
included

Damon
said
The

Liam
loped

it
up

So
I
shall

them
only
if

them
and
this

who

the

crisis
had
damaged
hopes
of
tax
cuts
It
will
cost
the

billion
this

that
would

added
I

a

Chancellor
by

But
this
is
a
sophisticated
world
When
I
cut
taxes
you
will
know

will
last
The

also
defended

He
said
We

not

then
try

Fears
over
jet
plunge
but
Brits
told
DON'T
PANIC
OLD
airliners
used
by
charter
holiday
firms
are
perfectly
safe
an
expert
insisted
yesterday
David
Learmount
was
eager
to
calm
the
fears
of
Brit
tourists
heading
for
the
sun
this
summer
after
a
year-old
jet
crashed
feet
from
the
skies
above
Florida
at
the
weekend
All
people
aboard
the
DC9
including
two
Britons
were
killed
Airline
officials
named
the
British
pair
as
Roger
and
Devlin
Loughney
The
pilot
of
the
Atlanta-bound
flight
from
Miami
reported
a
fire
moments
before
the
plane
hit
the
Everglades
swamps
like
a
bullet
But
Mr
Learmount
editor
of
Flight
International
declared
Years
don't
count
in
the
life
of
an
aircraft
What
matters
is
the
number
of
stress
cycles
take-offs
and
landings
it
has
completed
For
the
average
holiday
jet
that
figure
is
about
So
if
the
aircraft
has
been
well
maintained
and
servicing
of
planes
is
regularly
monitored
an
old
jet
is
just
as
safe
as
a
new
one
ValuJet
owners
of
the
DC9
which
sank
into
muddy
water
infested
with
thousands
of
alligators
and
venomous
snakes
offer
cheap
flights
on
old
aircraft
But
safety
standards
have
never
been
compromised
say
aviation
watchdogs
Fear
The
pilot
radioed
that
there
was
smoke
on
the
flight
deck
and
was
attempting
to
return
to
Miami
when
the
jet
disappeared
off
radar
screens
with
one
witness
saying
the
plane
burst
into
a
million
jagged
pieces
on
impact
and
that
none
of
the
passengers
or
five
crew
could
still
be
alive
Emergency
rescuers
who
quickly
called
off
their
search
for
survivors
could
not
get
close
because
the
swamp
was
covered
in
aviation
fuel
and
one
spark
might
have
triggered
an
inferno
But
they
are
also
working
in
fear
of
the
deadly
wildlife
gators
which
are
feet
long
and
Cottonmouth
snakes
that
kill
with
one
bite
As
fire
crews
collected
anti-venom
serum
from
a
local
zoo
an
initial
plan
was
agreed
to
build
a
makeshift
road
to
the
site
But
co-ordinator
Luis
Fernandez
declared
It's
still
going
to
be
a
nightmare
trying
to
recover
the
bodies
or
what's
left
of
them
The
spilt
fuel
could
also
ignite
at
any
time
At
some
stage
though
divers
will
have
to
go
into
find
the
voice
and
flight
data
recorders
The
DC9
formerly
owned
by
Turkish
Airlines
was
last
inspected
just
five
days
ago
ValuJet
company
president
Lewis
Jordan
said
he
had
no
idea
what
could
have
caused
the
accident
But
Federal
Aviation
Authority
records
show
the
aircraft
was
forced
to
return
to
airports
SEVEN
times
in
the
past
two
years
because
of
technical
difficulties
Fire
Last
summer
the
FAA
announced
special
inspections
of
the
company's
fleet
following
a
major
incident
in
June
A
fire
destroyed
one
of
ValuJet's
DC9s
on
a
runway
in
Atlanta
Georgia
but
all
passengers
and
crew
escaped
unhurt
Another
of
the
firm's
DC9s
got
stuck
in
mud
at
the
same
airport
last
January
And
that
was
followed
by
a
jet
with
people
aboard
sliding
into
a
snowbank
at
Dulles
Airport
Washington
But
no
significant
safety
deficencies
were
found
with
the
fleet
after
the
inspections
said
officials
And
expert
Mr
Learmount
emphasised
While
many
charter
firms
in
Britain
use
modern
aircraft
even
if
people
find
they're
aboard
a
year-old
plane
there's
NOTHING
to
worry
about
Airlines
have
two
methods
of
acquiring
passenger
aircraft
They
buy
new
at
a
serious
capital
outlay
and
have
low
maintenance
costs
or
secondhand
and
incur
high
maintenance
expenditure
Either
way
the
jets
are
safe

OJ

played

yesterday
and
was
left
flailing
in

when
the
Daily

demanded
Where

The
bogeyman
of

in

to

tried

But

was

There
were
angry
cries
of
Murderer!
when
he
flew
into
Heathrow
on
Saturday
So
the
Mirror
decided
to
confront
year-old
OJ
with
the
questions
he
must
answer
if
he
is
ever
to
be
fully
accepted
as
innocent
Caught
Our
quiz
was
so
penetrating
that
our
reporters
made
a
news
story
that
was
flashed
around
the
world
by
the
international
agency
Reuters
We
first
caught
up
with
Simpson
at
London's
Hyde
Park
Hotel
where
he
is
staying
in
a
a-night
two-bedroom
suite
at
the
expense
of
Granada
TV
Bodyguards
ushered
him
from
the
hotel
to
a
gold-coloured
chauffeur-driven
Jaguar
car
A
Granada
TV
minder
said
OJ
would
not
be
saying
anything
but
Simpson
wound
down
a
window
in
response
to
our
reporter's
request
We
are
from
the
Daily
Mirror
said
the
reporter
OJ
in
a
green
sweater
fawn
trousers
and
loaded
down
with
heavy
gold
jewellery
smiled
We
asked
Could
you
tell
us
where
you
were
between
and
on
the
night
of
the
murder
OJ
was
clearly
shocked
His
eyes
rolled
back
in
his
head
Another
question
Why
would
you
not
take
the
witness
stand
Mr
Simpson
OJ
was
now
grinning
broadly
but
he
was
still
saying
nothing
and
fumbling
for
the
switch
to
close
the
electric
window
Not
quick
enough
Perhaps
you
could
explain
why
your
blood
type
was
found
at
the
murder
scene
Mr
Simpson
With
that
the
window
shot
up
the
Jaguar
made
a
U-turn
in
front
of
the
hotel
bringing
traffic
screeching
to
a
halt
then
raced
off
down
Knightsbridge
Forty
minutes
later
the
limo
swept
into
the
Selsdon
Park
golf
course
in
Surrey
and
once
again
we
were
firing
questions
Daily

If
you
are
innocent
why
did
you
refuse
to
give
evidence
during
the
trial

refuses
to

Right-wing
ministers
are
also
anxious
to
see
the
rebels
back
in
the
fold
One
said
yesterday
that
they
should
have
the
whip
returned
by
Easter
Ministers
and
Tory
MPs
now
technically
in
a
minority
in
the
Commons
are
particularly
concerned
about
losing
their
majority
on
important
parliamentary
committees
MPs
loyal
to
the
party
are
also
worried
about
signs
of
growing
cohesion
among
the
rebels
to
the
extent
that
they
could
become
an
embryonic
party
One
rebel
Christopher
Gill
MP
for
Ludlow
said
I
am
reconciled
to
the
fact
that
we
will
only
regain
the
whip
when
the
management
offer
to
take
us
all
back
It
is
all
or
nothing
We
will
not
be
picked
off
separately
Another
rebel
said
that
the
group
of
nine
was
looking
for
a
room
in
the
House
of
Commons
to
co-ordinate
its
parliamentary
activities
Yesterday
the
Ulster
Unionists
said
that
Mr
Major
could
not
rely
on
the
votes
of
their
nine
MPs
in
Tuesday's
division
on
VAT
Labour
will
introduce
a
procedural
amendment
allowing
a
special
vote
on
the
implementation
of
VAT
on
fuel
This
could
unite
the
opposition
parties
and
draw
in
enough
discontented
Tories
to
scupper
the
bn
tax
measure
David
Trimble
MP
for
Upper
Bann
said
I
think
the
Government
is
in
very
serious
danger
of
being
defeated
Potential
Tory
opponents
include
Nicholas
Winterton
MP
for
Macclesfield
and
William
Powell
MP
for
Corby
Mr
Winterton
said
the
Parliamentary
arithmetic
was
extremely
finely
balanced
Labour
claimed
that
it
had
recruited
another
high
profile
Conservative
MP
Senior
Cabinet
sources
indicated
that
the
rebels
would
not
be
offered
any
more
compromises
by
the
government
They
said
there
was
no
political
credit
to
be
won
from
backing
down
people
would
think
that
the
government
had
lost
control
But
ministers
anxiously
point
out
that
Tuesday's
division
is
on
a
procedural
motion
and
can
therefore
not
be
seen
as
a
vote
of
confidence
They
argue
that
according
to
precedent
a
defeat
on
the
VAT
issue
itself
need
not
be
a
matter
of
confidence
Michael
Howard
the
Home
Secretary
appealed
for
loyalty
arguing
We
have
to
demonstrate
to
the
markets
that
we
have
a
firm
grip
on
the
public
finances

WESTERN

Bosnia
stood
on
the
brink
of
collapse
yesterday
after
a
week
of
defeat
subterfuge
and
recrimination
Tragedy
mixed
with
farce
as
hours
after
agreeing
new
peace
proposals
the
five
powers
in
the
so-called
Contact
Group
fell
out
among
themselves
Russia
used
its
Security
Council
veto
and
the
UN
and
Nato
were
in
bitter
dispute
over
the
use
of
air
power
while
their
peace
proposals
were
swiftly
rejected
by
both
the
Serbs
and
the
Muslim-led
government
in
Bosnia
The
visit
today
by
Douglas
Hurd
to
Belgrade
looks
like
a
mission
impossible
Last
night
Mr
Hurd
said
that
UN
peace-keepers
could
pull
out
of
Bosnia
in
weeks
if
the
warring
parties
do
not
accept
the
international
peace
plan
Using
its
veto
for
the
first
time
in
a
year
Russia
blocked
a
resolution
that
would
have
stopped
flows
of
fuel
from
Serbia
to
Serbs
in
Croatia
and
Bosnia
The
Russians
want
more
concessions
to
the
Serbian
government
of
Slobodan
Milosevic
to
ease
moves
towards
peace
in
Bosnia
Backed
by
Britain
and
France
Russia
had
pressed
for
a
lifting
of
sanctions
when
the
Contact
Group
met
in
Brussels
on
Friday
but
was
rebuffed
by
the
Americans
who
insisted
that
Mr
Milosevic
must
first
deliver
the
Bosnian
Serbs
acceptance
of
a
peace
plan
British
sources
said
the
discussions
were
long
and
difficult
Mr
Hurd
visits
Belgrade
today
with
Alain
Juppe
the
French
foreign
minister
to
offer
concessions
to
Mr
Milosevic
notably
the
idea
that
there
could
be
links
between
the
Bosnian
Serbs
and
Serbia
itself
after
Belgrade
had
recognised
the
integrity
of
Bosnia
The
Contact
Group's
fragile
and
tangled
consensus
was
only
achieved
by
forcing
the
US
to
drop
plans
to
back
the
Bosnian
government
with
air
power
but
the
cost
has
been
utter
confusion
in
Nato
and
a
furious
battle
with
the
UN
The
UN's
military
commanders
led
by
General
Sir
Michael
Rose
have
pressed
for
an
end
to
Nato's
aerial
presence
over
Bosnia
and
seem
to
have
largely
succeeded
Since
this
was
done
without
consultation
with
the
Nato
leadership
in
Brussels
however
it
leaves
the
new
secretary-general
Willy
Claes
looking
foolish
Last
night
a
UN
source
said
Nato
had
resumed
flights
over
Bosnia
as
a
sort
of
trial
balloon
We
sent
a
letter
to
the
Serbs
advising
them
that
Nato
would
be
resuming
some
flights
and
explaining
why
these
should
not
be
interpreted
as
posing
a
threat
said
a
U.N
official
in
Sarajevo
The
US
remains
angry
at
what
it
sees
as
European
appeasement
of
the
Serbs
And
the
cost
has
been
chaos
in
Nato
which
now
looks
unlikely
ever
to
engage
in
a
peacekeeping
mission
with
the
UN
again
The
one
job
it
may
get
is
to
pull
the
UN
out
of
Bosnia
if
the
situation
deteriorates
or
if
the
US
unilaterally
lifts
the
arms
embargo
on
the
Bosnian
government
Nato
planners
are
ready
to
commit
around
troops
including
US
forces
to
cover
the
evacuation
of
the
peacekeepers
The
UN
envoy
Yasushi
Akashi
left
Sarajevo
empty-handed
yesterday
after
failing
to
persuade
the
Bosnian
Serb
leadership
to
move
towards

editor
who

of

Ms

is
now
attempting
to
prevent
the
succession
of
Mr
Haylett
and
assure
the
succession
of
Mr
Corry
by
calling
in
lawyers
There
is
a
possibility
that
the

of

will
be
decided
by

servants
of

of
Kim
Il

who
succeeded
his

earlier

Ms

is
an
old-style
Communist
hardliner
and
is
married
to
another
such
Mike
Hicks
who
in
the
mid-1980s
supported
the
Morning

when
its
editor
Tony
Chater
led
the
paper
away
from
the
old
Communist
Party
which
had
been
taken
over
by
revisionists
and
Euro-communists
The
succession
battle
began
when
Mr
Chater
announced
in
October
he
was
going
to
retire
after
years
at
the
paper's
helm
Everything
was
set
for

be
chosen
as
editor
at
a
meeting
on
October
of
the
management
committee
of
the
People's

PPPS
The

is
chaired
by
Ken
Gill
former
leader
of
the
white-collar
union
TASS
and
once
the
most
powerful
Communist
in
the
trade
union
movement
and
runs
or
thinks
it
runs
the
paper
Mr
Gill
Mr
Haylett
and
their
supporters
reckoned
without
Ms
Rosser
who
at
the
meeting
announced
the
vote
could
not
go
ahead
There
were
legal
grounds
for
supposing
that
the
member
PPPS
committee
did
not
in
fact
run
the
paper
she
said
Instead
she
suggested
that
the
four-member
Morning
Star
management
committee
which
includes
herself
and
Mr
Chater
had
the
sole
right
to
decide
who
would
be
the
next
editor
Lawyers
were
called
and
their
decision
will
not
be
known
until
next

The
legal
intervention
has
provoked
outrage
Rosser
Hicks
and
Chater
are
egoists
who
want
to
retain
their
control
said
one
trade
unionist
In
any
normal
organisation
Rosser
would
declare
an
interest
and
say
she
could
have
no
part
in
a
selection
process
in
which
her
son-in-law
is
involved
Ms
Rosser
last
week
denied
the
accusations
of
nepotism
I've
just
raised
a
legal
query
about
who
manages
the
paper
she
said
As
to
my
son-in-law's
position
he
did
not
come
to
the
paper
as
my
son-in-law
and
I
can
hardly
disqualify
a
candidate
just
because
he
happens
to
marry
my
daughter
Mr
Gill
is
certain
that
in
the
end
the
legal
arguments
will
be
brushed
aside
and
Mr
Haylett
will
be
elected
Some
are
not
so
sanguine
It's
a
very
bitter
atmosphere

Paranoia

was
set
up
at

of
July
with

the

claimed
that
fewer

either

as

according
to
a

slogan
Before
the

from

would
flock
in

baths
at
the

The
central
and
southern
stretches
of
the
promenade
seethed
with
weavers
in
search
of
entertainment
The
reason
Mr
Blobby
failed
to
pull
them
in
may
be
most
to
do
with
location
For
it
was
at
the
northern
end
of
the
town
the
posh
neighbourhood
of
Bare
where
Noel
Edmonds
decided
to
place
his
Crinkley
Bottom
taking
over
most
of
a
public
park
called
Happy
Mount
That
appears
to
have
been
his
big
mistake
It
is
not
that
locals
are
without
a
sense
of
humour
they
used
to
enjoy
visiting
comedians
making
cracks
about
the
Bare
Ladies
swimming-pool
and
the
Bare
Ladies
Guild
What
they
did
not
enjoy
however
were
the
squeals
of
excited
children
hours
a
day
They
complained
to
their
local
councillors
about
the
noise
the
loss
of
Happy
Mount
park
the
fact
that
Crinkley
Bottom's
garish
entrance
arch
all
but
eclipsed
the
motto
on
the
original
park
gates
Beauty
surrounds
health
abounds
They
objected
to
the
council
investing
large
sums
of
money
in
the
theme
park
while
neglecting
to
fill
in
dangerous
potholes
where
the
elderly
and
blind
take
daily
strolls
More
than
signed
an
anti-Blobby
petition
The
local
Tory
MP
Sir
Mark
Lennox-Boyd
wrote
to
the
Lancaster
town
clerk
suggesting
that
Crinkley
Bottom
should
go
and
Happy
Mount
be
restored
I
fear
he
said
that
one
must
inevitably
conclude
that
the
development
has
been
a
failure
and
a
most
unhappy
experience
for
the
people
of
Bare
Others
take
a
different
view
The
theme
park's
manager
Mike
Slattery
said
By
closing
Crinkley

the
council
has
shot
Morecambe
in
the
foot

A

Turmoil
in
the
Conservative
Party
increased
yesterday
as
Peter
Lilley
a
leading
Eurosceptic
in
the
Cabinet
urged
John
Major
quickly
to
restore
the
whip
to
the
eight
Tory
rebels
who
refused
to
back
him
in
a
vote
of
confidence
in
the
Commons
last
week
The
Social
Security
Secretary
said
he
wanted
the
whip
restored
as
soon
as
possible
It
was
essential
he
said
that
the
party
was
able
to
unite
for
the
next
election
around
a
Eurosceptical
position
Mr
Lilley's
remarks
on
the
eve
of
a
cliff-hanger
vote
on
increasing
VAT
on
fuel
will
be
seen
as
disloyal
to
the
Prime
Minister
and
annoy
Mr
Major's
supporters
who
think
the
action
he
ordered
was
a
necessary
show
of
firm
leadership
But
senior
Tory
figures
openly
questioned
the
Prime
Minister's
judgement
in
effectively
throwing
away
the
Government's
majority
to
limit
the
rebellion
on
the
European
Finance
Bill
The
Chief
Whip
Richard
Ryder
was
also
being
privately
criticised
Calls
for
the
whip
to
be
reinstated
for
the
rebels
were
increasing
The
rebels
won
support
from
leading
Tory
backbenchers
including
Kenneth
Baker
the
former
chairman
of
the
party
and
George
Gardiner
chairman
of
the
Thatcherite
Group
of
Tory
MPs
I
think
we
want
these
people
to
work
their
way
back
into
the
party
and
take
the
whip
again
and
get
over
that
division
said
Mr
Lilley
during
a
BBC
television
interview
yesterday
We
want
to
go
united
into
the
next
general
election
on
a
Eurosceptical
position
a
strong
pro-British
position
which
will
be
a
marked
contrast
to
the
Labour
Party
who
want
to
submerge
us
lock
stock
and
barrel
in
a
European
socialist
super-state
We
will
only
be
able
to
reap
the
rewards
of
having
a
typically
Tory
stand
if
we
can
do
so
as
a
united
party
I
hope
the
rebels
who
lost
the
whip
as
a
result
of
that
rebellion
will
work
themselves
back
into
the
party
in
due
course
Let
us
hope
they
get
themselves
back
on
board
as
soon
as
possible
There
was
a
growing
belief
among
Conservative
MPs
and
Cabinet
sources
yesterday
that
the
Prime
Minister
will
be
forced
to
relent
early
in
the
new
year
and
restore
the
whip
to
the
rebels
although
it

a
feat
unequalled

Blair
backs
plans
to
reform
monarchy
A
battle
over
reforming
the
monarchy
is
expected
to
become
a
central
part
of
the
next
election
after
Jack
Straw
the
Shadow
Home
Secretary
last
night
stood
by
remarks
about
slimming
down
the
Royal
Family
to
a
Scandinavian
style
of
court
His
comments
led
to
an
immediate
attack
by
Michael
Heseltine
and
Cabinet
colleagues
who
believe
Labour's
plans
will
be
a
vote-loser
The
President
of
the
Board
of
Trade
accused
Labour
of
undermining
the
very
fabric
of
our
political
constitution
But
Tony
Blair
the
Labour
leader
has
backed
the
reforms
that
Mr
Straw
will
raise
tonight
during
a
BBC
Panorama
programme
about
the
Royal
Family
Labour's
changes
would
mean
a
reduction
in
the
size
of
the
Royal
Family
from
the
present
people
entitled
to
be
called
His
or
Her
Royal
Highness
to
around
with
just
five
or
six
performing
official
duties
The
Queen
already
reimburses
the
taxpayer
for
the
royals
on
the
civil
list
apart
from
the
Queen
Mother
and
the
Duke
of
Edinburgh
Labour
would
not
change
that
Mr
Straw
says
in
the
programme
Long
to
Reign
Over
Us
that
a
Blair
government
would
very
swiftly
remove
the
right
of
hereditary
peers
to
sit
and
vote
in
the
House
of
Lords
That
would
make
a
big
difference
to
the
public's
perception
of
the
monarchy
I
think
it
will
hasten
the
process
towards
a
more
Scandanavian
monarchy
a
monarchy
symbolising
a
much
more
classless
society
someone
who's
above
the
political
battle
Mr
Straw
says
Mr
Blair
as
Shadow
Home
Secretary
under
John
Smith
was
responsible
for
drawing
up
Labour's
comprehensive
package
of
constitutional
reforms
including
the
abolition
of
the
Royal
Prerogative
such
as
the
power
to
wage
war
It
was
adopted
as
party
policy
at
the
annual
conference
Labour
leaders
were
nervous
about
the
way
leaks
of
Mr
Straw's
remarks
had
been
reported
over
the
weekend
and
were
quick
to
point
out
that
Labour
had
no
secret
agenda
for
a
republic
We
are
not
suggesting
getting
rid
of
the
monarchy
or
drastically
descaling
it
and
Jack
Straw
hasn't
departed
from
party
policy
said
a
Blair
source
Mr
Blair's
office
said
the
party
was
happy
to
see
constitutional
reform
become
an
election
issue
which
was
threatened
on
Friday
by
John
Major
over
Labour's
plans
for
Welsh
and
Scottish
assemblies
Taxing
the
Queen
had
happened
under
the
Tories
said
Mr
Blair's
office
The
constitutional
reforms
were
the
dividing
line
between
Labour
and
the
Tories
which
Labour
would
not
avoid
said
one
source
Major
sees
nothing
wrong
in
the
constitution
We
do
and
we
are
quite
happy
to
fight
him
on
constitutional
reform
he
said
Mr
Straw
a
long-term
critic
of
the
Royal
Family
last
year
he
described
the
monarchy
as
deeply
decadent
said
yesterday
his
remarks
were
in
tune
with
public
opinion
What
we
are
observing
is
in
tune
with
what
the
public
are
thinking
that
the
monarchy
will
inevitably
have
a
role
which
will
mean
its
survival
but
its
redefinition
he
said
on
BBC
radio
The
changes
we
are
talking
about
do
not
necessarily
spell
the
end
of
the
monarchy
not
for
a
second
but
it
does
mean
the
monarchy's
role
will
end
up
being
redefined
He
said
that
the
changes
to
the
monarchy
and
the
Royal
Prerogative
were
part
of
a
larger
package
of
reforms
including

Milosevic
supports
peace
moves
Slobodan
Milosevic
the
President
of
Serbia
yesterday
said
that
he
would
support
new
international
efforts
to
bring
peace
to
Bosnia
We
all
agreed
that
there
could
be
no
military
solution
that
the
only
answer
is
a
negotiated
solution
said
Douglas
Hurd
the
Foreign
Secretary
after
meeting
the
Serbian
leader
But
he
added
We
don't
feel
that
we
have
much
time
Mr
Milosevic's
support
could
help
to
put
pressure
on
the
Bosnian
Serbs
to
agree
to
a
ceasefire
But
time
is
short
with
the
West
increasingly
uncertain
about
how
long
UN
peace-keepers
can
remain
in
Bosnia
and
a
continuing
threat
that
the
US
Congress
will
lift
the
arms
embargo
on
the
Bosnian
government
In
a
private
session
Mr
Hurd
and
the
French
Foreign
Minister
Alain
Jupp
warned
the
Serbian
President
that
if
things
do
not
improve
in
Bosnia
the
UN
peace-keepers
are
likely
to
be
withdrawn
Mr
Milosevic
interrupted
to
say
that
this
would
be
very
dangerous
Today
Malcolm
Rifkind
the
Minister
of
Defence
is
to
fly
to
the
Croatian
port
of
Split
for
urgent
talks
with
the
UN
commander
in
Bosnia
Lieutenant-General
Sir
Michael
Rose
amid
speculation
that
Mr
Rifkind
could
be
coming
to
consult
General
Rose
about
plans
to
pull
the
British
contingent
of
several
thousand
peace-keepers
out
of
Bosnia
In
Belgrade
Mr
Hurd
said
that
the
risks
to
the
peace-keepers
were
completely
unacceptable
and
said
this
made
a
rapid
deal
vital
Mr
Juppe
said
We
wanted
to
stress
the
urgency
and
I
underline
the
word
urgency
of
a
ceasefire
and
a
cessation
of
violence
Newt
Gingrich
the
incoming
Republican
House
Speaker
yesterday
said
UN
troops
should
be
withdrawn
from
Yugoslavia
and
urged
the
training
and
arming
of
Bosnian
forces
and
retaliation
by
US
air
power
against
any
Serbian
offensive
When
we
get
to
a
serious
problem
with
serious
violence
the
United
Nations
is
literally
incompetent
and
kills
people
he
said
After
meeting
Mr
Hurd
and
Mr
Juppe
Mr
Milosevic
said
that
he
would
step
up
efforts
to
persuade
the
Bosnian
Serbs
that
their
war
was
futile
and
that
continued
fighting
would
not
help
their
position
Today
the
Serbian
President
is
to
meet
dissident
Bosnian
Serbs
opposed
to
Radovan
Karadzic
the
Bosnian
Serb
leader
in
an
attempt
to
enlist
their
support
Britain
and
France
believe
that
assisting
Mr
Milosevic
is
the
only
way
to
broker
peace
The
US
is
deeply
sceptical
and
Mr
Hurd
and
Mr
Juppe
visited
Belgrade
in
their
capacity
as
national
foreign
ministers
not
as
representatives
of
the
five
nation
contact
group
The
US
envoy
Charles
Redman
is
separately
touring
the
region
to
bolster
support
for
the
new
peace
moves
and
further
efforts
will
be
made
today
at
the
Budapest
summit
of
the
Conference
for
Security
and
Co-operation
in
Europe
In
a
rare
public
appearance
Mr
Milosevic
flanked
by
Mr
Hurd
and
Mr
Juppe
backed
the
contact
group
strategy
agreed
last
Friday
in
Brussels
It
is
based
on
a
peace
plan
agreed
in
July
splitting
Bosnia
between
a
Muslim-Croat
federation
on
the
one
hand
and
the
Bosnian
Serbs
on
the
other
Mr
Milosevic
supported
the
plan
then
but
made
little
headway
in
persuading
the
Bosnian
Serbs
He
believes
however
that
a
new
offer
of
future
constitutional
links
between
Serbia
and
the
Bosnian
Serbs
plus
a
provision
for
land
swaps
could
help

Fury
over

plan
Straw
proposes
Nordic
model
THE
SHADOW
home
secretary
Jack
Straw
was
accused
by
a
rampant
Conservative
Party
last
night
of
seeking
to
undermine
Britain's
most
cherished
institutions
after
he
suggested
that
the
royal
family
be
cut
from
to
six
and
that
the
monarchy
become
a
figurehead
at
the
apex
of
a
classless
society
With
Conservative
MPs
desperate
to
distract
attention
from
their
own
travails
cabinet
ministers
played
the
patriotic
card
portraying
Mr
Straw's
remarks
as
part
of
a
wider
attack
on
the
union
the
House
of
Lords
and
freedom
from
control
by
Brussels
Peter
Lilley
the
Social
Security
Secretary
accused
Labour
of
becoming
strange
allies
of
the
Murdoch
press
in
setting
a
republican
agenda
and
said
it
was
quite
wrong
for
Labour
to
put
the
monarchy
in
the
front
line
of
political
debate
He
said
the
Labour
leadership
had
to
give
some
bone
for
their
leftwing
activists
to
home
in
on
so
they
have
got
downgrading
the
monarchy
reforming
the
constitution
to
break
Britain
up
into
its
component
parts
and
submerge
Britain
into
a
socialist
superstate
in
Europe
all
of
which
will
be
profoundly
unpopular
with
Labour
voters
but
appeal
to
Labour
Party
activists
Michael
Heseltine
the
Trade
and
Industry
Secretary
said
Labour
in
its
desperation
to
find
some
new
policy
ground
has
descended
to
undermining
the
very
fabric
of
our
political
constitution
The
Labour
leadership
stressed
that
it
had
no
plans
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
royal
family
and
its
only
proposals
affecting
the
monarchy
had
been
published
two
years
ago
by
Tony
Blair
These
included
a
commitment
to
fixed-term
parliaments
ending
ministerial
use
of
the
royal
prerogative
and
abolishing
hereditary
peerages
Mr
Straw
a
long-term
critic
of
the
monarchy
insisted
he
had
been
misrepresented
and
was
only
seeking
to
modernise
the
monarchy
to
protect
it
Nevertheless
he
privately
believes
it
is
tactically
right
for
Labour
to
have
the
argument
over
its
sweeping
constitutional
reform
package
now
in
the
hope
that
John
Major
will
be
unable
at
the
next
election
to
represent
Labour's
plans
as
an
attack
on
the
national
identity
a
tactic
the
Prime
Minister
deployed
in
the
final
weeks
of
the
general
election
The
row
arose
from
a
Panorama
TV
interview
discussed
with
Mr
Blair
in
advance
to
be
broadcast
tonight
in
which
Mr
Straw
states
One
measure
which
a
Blair
government
will
take
very
swiftly
and
Tony
Blair
has
himself
committed
to
is
the
removal
of
the
right
of
hereditary
peers
to
sit
and
vote
in
the
House
of
Lords
The
removal
of
peers
hereditary
peers
from
the
House
of
Lords
and
their
right
to
vote
or
speak
will
make
a
big
difference
to
the
perception
of
the
monarchy
I
think
it
will
hasten
the
process
towards
a
more
Scandinavian
monarchy
a
monarch
symbolising
a
much
more
classless
society
someone
who
has
been
above
the
battle
than
has
been
the
case
hitherto
This
does
not
necessarily
spell
the
end
of
the
monarchy
not
for
a
second
But
it
does
mean
of
course
that
the
monarchy's
role
will
be
redefined
The
monarchy
is
caught
at
a
crossroads
between
whether
it
continues
as
the
apex
of
a
very
hierarchical
system
in
our
society
or
whether
it
moves
over
to
be
a
symbol
a
figurehead
of
a
much
more
classless
society
Mr
Straw
also
criticises
the
Prince
of
Wales
for
occasionally
being
too
strident
and
warns
that
if
the
prince
follows
his
own
agenda
too
closely
people
will
start
calling
for
a
republic
He
proposes
a
reduction
in
the
royal
family
possibly
from
the
present
entitled
to
be
called
His
or
Her
Royal
Highness
to
with

or
six

Defending

he
said
There
is
no

there
is
a
very
serious
debate
taking

strong

was
held
an
upsurge
of
fighting
between
Serbs
and
Croats
on
Bosnia's
western
borders
underlined
the
poor
prospects
for
a

breakthrough
The
fighting
around
the
town
of
Bosanko
Stavho
left
Bosnian
Serb
soldiers
dead
and
wounded
There
were
fears
last
night
that
the

confrontation
between
Serbs
and
Croats
could
intensify
the
conflict
in
neighbouring
Bosnia
The
Defence

Malcolm
Rifkind
is
to
begin
a
two-day
visit
to
Bosnia
today
that
will
help
decide
whether
Britain's

is
to
be

for
talks
as
pressure
mounts
for
a
pullout
A
growing
number
of
senior
Tories
are
pressing
for
a
policy
rethink
Sir
Nicholas
Bonsor
chairman
of
the
Commons
defence
committee
called
publicly
yesterday
for
British
troops
to
be
pulled
out
The
sombre
prospects
for
a
resumption
of
peace
negotiations
were
underlined
when
United
States
negotiators
said
they
had
failed
to
make
headway
in
talks
with
the
Bosnian
Serb
leader
Radovan
Karadzic
The
special
US
representative
in
former
Yugoslavia
Charles
Redman
explained
the
international
contact
group's
latest
peace
proposals
when
he
met
Bosnian
Serb
leaders
in
Pale
There
was
no
indication
that
Mr
Karadzic
had
moved
nor
did
we
expect
him
to
a
senior
US
official
travelling
to
the
European
security
conference
in
Budapest
with
the
US
secretary
of
state
Warren
Christopher
said
The
Bosnian
crisis
and
the
Serb
threat
to
Bihac
and
other
so-called
UN
safe
areas
are
sure
to
dominate
the
two-day
summit
of
the
Conference
on
Security
and
Co-operation
in
Europe
which
begins
in
the
Hungarian
capital
today
In
another
sign
of
renewed
tension
Nato
resumed
air
patrols
yesterday
to
enforce
the
no
fly
ban
over
Bosnia
in
spite
of
the
increased
risk
of
confrontation
with
Bosnian
Serb
forces
which
have
deployed
advanced
ground
to
air
missiles
The
flights
were
resumed
after
Nato
denied
UN
claims
that
they
were
being
scaled
down
to
help
the
peace
process
Gen
Sir
Michael
Rose
warned
that
Nato
would
hit
back
if
its
planes
were
targeted
by
missile
batteries
If
somebody
puts
radar
on
to
one
of
our
aircraft
or
indeed
fires
a
missile
at
it
the
aircraft
has
every
right
of
self-defence
to
send
a
missile
back
down
the
radar
beam
or
at
the
missile
site
itself
he
said
Although
the
US
Russia
Britain
France
and
Germany
reiterated
their
support
for
the
international
peace
plan
when
they
met
in
Brussels
on
Friday
differing
interpretations
of
the
plan
have
emerged
The
British
French
and
Russian
governments
all
say
its
reference
to
balanced
and
equitable
rights
for
the
Serb
Croat
and
Muslim
communities
in
Bosnia
is
veiled
jargon
for
allowing
the
Bosnian
Serbs
to
negotiate
close
links
with
Serbia
But
the
German
and
US
governments
insist
any
confederation
that
would
effectively
concede
the
principle
of
Greater
Serbian
president
backs
contact
group
peace
plan
Serbia
would
be
in
the
words
of
the
German
foreign
minister
Klaus
Kinkel
absolutely
out
of
the
question
Mr
Milosevic
and
the
Bosnian
Serb
leaders
also
know
there
are
differences
within
the
contact
group
about
whether
to
relax
economic
sanctions
against
Serbia
There
are
a
least
two
different
interpretations
of
what
the
international
contact
group
plan
means
We
have
been
given
assurances
by
the
Americans
and
the
Germans
about
what
they
mean
so
we
are
not
getting
unduly
excited
one
senior
Bosnian
government
diplomat
said
One
hopeful
development
was
the
freeing
of
British
and
Dutch
UN
soldiers
after
Mr
Akashi
met
Bosnian
Serb
leaders
to
negotiate
the
release
of
several
hundred
UN
peacekeepers
detained
after
Nato
air
strikes
two
weeks
ago
The
British
military
engineers
who
had
been
held
at
the
town
of
Rogatica
east
of
Sarajevo
arrived
in
the
Bosnian
enclave
of
Gorazde
Later
the
Dutch
held
at
Zvornik
were
allowed
into
the
enclave
of
Srebrenica
They
are
very
happy
a
UN
spokesman
Colonel
Jan-Dirk
Merveldt
said
after
the
British
troops
arrived
They
are
in
Gorazde
getting
hot
showers
and
hot
meals
None
of
their
kit
was
taken
The
Bosnian
Serbs
also
agreed
to
lift
their
blockade
on
UN
aid
convoys
to
besieged
Muslim
enclaves
A
UN
supply
convoy
from
the
Croatian
capital
Zagreb
reached
Bangladeshi

in
the

But
UN

had

on
Saturday

Minister
touched
women
at
exorcism
AN
Anglican
clergyman
who
allegedly
performed
exorcisms
which
involved
the
internal
cleansing
of
sexually
abused
women
is
being
investigated
by
Scotland
Yard
it
was
revealed
last
night
The
Rev
Andrew
Arbuthnot
an
Old
Etonian
is
alleged
to
have
poured
wine
over
the
victims
genitals
inserted
crucifixes
and
used
his
fingers
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
their
vaginas
Mr
Arbuthnot
is
said
to
have
continued
ministering
to
a
congregation
at
the
London
Healing
Mission
in
Notting
Hill
west
London
despite
having
his
licence
revoked
last
year
which
means
he
can
no
longer
practice
as
a
minister
in
the
Church
of
England
The
Bishop
of
Wakefield
Nigel
McCulloch
chairman
of
the
Church's
communication
unit
said
that
if
the
claims
were
true
such
practices
were
utterly
disgusting
and
blasphemous
They
were
not
recognisable
as
part
of
any
Anglican
creed
A
Scotland
Yard
spokesman
said
officers
were
investigating
the
matter
although
he
did
not
name
Mr
Arbuthnot
Last
September
the
Association
of
Christian
Counsellors
ended
its
affiliation
with
the
London
Healing
Mission
after
an
eight-month
investigation
into
internal
ministries
Graham
Baldwin
the
director
of
Catalyst
a
counseling
service
for
victims
of
cult
abuse
said
The
idea
of
the
exorcisms
is
that
to
get
the
demons
out
you
have
to
in
some
way
get
contact
with
the
entry
point
of
the
demon
as
well
as
somehow
consecrating
the
place
where
the
abuse
occurred
It
is
outrageous
The
Rev
Robert
Marshall
spokesman
for
the
Diocese
of
London
said
What
we
need
to
make
clear
to
people
who
attend
his
services
is
that
he
is
nothing
to
do
with
the
Church
of
England
He
is
effectively
freelancing
since
the
bishop
withdrew
permission
for
him
to
officiate
He
has
not
however
been
defrocked
and
is
still
a
priest
Mr
Arbuthnot
a
former
merchant
banker
who
served
in
the
Scots
Guards

stood
as
a

BRITAIN
could
start
withdrawing
its
troops
from
Bosnia
within
weeks
if
the
warring
factions
reject
the
latest
plans
for
a
settlement
Douglas
Hurd
the
Foreign
Secretary
said
yesterday
Malcolm
Rifkind
the
Defence
Secretary
is
flying
to
Croatia
and
Bosnia
today
for
an
emergency
meeting
with
Lieutenant-General
Sir
Michael
Rose
the
United
Nations
commander
to
discuss
the
looming
nightmare
of
a
forced
evacuation
of
more
than
troops
in
mid-winter
and
in
the
teeth
of
determined
opposition
Mr
Hurd
issued
his
sombre
warning
as
he
and
Alain
Jupp
the
French
Foreign
Minister
flew
to
Belgrade
for
talks
with
President
Milosevic
of
Serbia
At
their
meeting
they
tried
to
stiffen
his
resolve
to
force
the
Bosnian
Serbs
to
accept
concessions
offered
on
Friday
by
the
five-nation
Contact
Group
The
two
ministers
then
flew
on
to
Budapest
where
Bosnia
will
dominate
the
summit
of
the
Conference
on
Security
and
Co-operation
in
Europe
which
begins
today
Before
leaving
Britain
Mr
Hurd
said
that
if
there
was
not
a
settlement
within
weeks
it
might
become
unavoidable
to
lift
the
arms
embargo
Britain
would
first
have
to
withdraw
its
troops
He
was
pessimistic
about
the
prospects
for
a
negotiated
settlement
and
indicated
that
if
the
latest
efforts
failed
there
would
be
no
alternative
but
to
let
the
parties
fight
it
out
After
talks
with
Mr
Milosevic
the
Foreign
Secretary
said
that
the
situation
on
the
ground
was
now
quite
unacceptable
for
UN
soldiers
He
did
not
see
how
a
peace
plan
could
get
underway
again
or
how
the
UN
forces
could
continue
saving
lives
unless
there
was
a
ceasefire
The
prospects
are
dark
indeed
The
Bosnian
Serbs
made
two
modest
concessions
yesterday
releasing
British
soldiers
who
were
allowed
to
continue
their
journey
to
the
eastern
enclave
of
Gorazde
Earlier
in
the
day
a
resupply
convoy
for
the
Bangladeshi
battalion
arrived
in
the
Bihac
pocket
carrying
food
and
fuel
The
convoy
was
too
late
for
one
Bangladeshi
peacekeeper
who
died
of
a
heart
attack
because
of
exposure
to
cold
and
a
lack
of
medicine
and
medical
equipment
The
mission
by
the
two
ministers
whose
forces
are
most
exposed
to
possible
Serb
retaliation
was
almost
cancelled
when
the
Americans
flatly
refused
to
countenance
anything
they
said
would
reward
aggression
and
almost
turned
down
the
proposal
to
allow
the
Bosnian
Serbs
possible
confederation
with
Serbia
In
the
end
this
principle
was
agreed
but
wrapped
up
in
coded
language
saying
that
there
had
to
be
equitable
and
balanced
arrangements
for
all
parties
This
allows
the
Bosnian
Serbs
the
same
right
as
the
Muslims
and
Croats
to
form
special
relationships
with
their
neighbours
President
Milosevic
yesterday
expressed
optimism
that
these
latest
inducements
would
be
enough
to
persuade
Radovan
Karadzic
the
Bosnian
Serb
leader
and
his
associates
in
Pale
to
agree
the
Contact
Group
plan
He
himself
accepted
the
plan
in
July
How
to
resolve
the
Bosnia
issue

Helmut
Kohl

Blair
backs
Straw
over
a
new
role
for
the
monarchy
TONY
BLAIR
confirmed
yesterday
that
he
intended
to
make
fundamental
changes
to
the
role
of
the
Royal
Family
an
issue
in
the
next
general
election
The
Labour
leader
made
clear
that
the
Labour
Party
would
press
for
debate
on
the
future
of
the
constitution
and
defended
Jack
Straw
the
Shadow
Home
Secretary
who
came
under
attack
for
saying
that
Labour
wanted
to
redefine
the
role
of
the
monarchy
and
halve
the
present
people
entitled
to
be
called
His
or
Her
Royal
Highness
with
just
five
or
six
performing
official
duties
Mr
Straw
said
he
was
reflecting
widespread
anger
among
ordinary
people
There
is
a
very
serious
debate
taking
place
among
British
citizens
about
the
role
of
the
monarchy
There
could
not
be
anything
but
given
the
publicity
which
the
monarchy
has
received
not
least
from
its
own
leading
members
he
said
yesterday
on
BBC
Radio
s
The
World
This
Weekend
He
added
The
changes
we
are
talking
about
do
not
necessarily
spell
the
end
of
the
monarchy
but
it
does
mean
the
monarchy's
role
will
end
up
being
redefined
Mr
Straw
says
in
tonight's
BBC
Panorama
programme
that
the
Royal
Family
should
become
more
like
Scandinavian
monarchies
symbolising
a
more
classless
society
He
outlines
a
series
of
radical
changes
that
include
reducing
government
powers
and
abolishing
the
right
of
hereditary
peers
to
vote
in
the
House
of
Lords
He
also
questions
whether
the
Prince
of
Wales
has
taken
on
a
role
appropriate
for
a
monarch
It's
whether
he's
gone
too
far
become
too
strident
in
his
views
that's
the
point
His
demands
for
an
overhaul
of
the
constitution
including
limits
on
ministers
use
of
the
royal
prerogative
to
push
through
legislation
are
part
of
a
larger
package
of
reform
including
a
Bill
of
Rights
and
increased
accountability
for
councils
and
other
public
bodies
Conservative
ministers
rounded
on
Mr
Straw
accusing
him
of
downgrading
the
monarchy
and
undermining
the
constitution
Peter
Lilley
the
Social
Security
Secretary
accused
Labour
of
pandering
to
left-wing
activists
and
said
that
the
tactics
could
easily
backfire
alienating
millions
of
ordinary
voters
I
regret
very
much
that
they
have
put
the
future
of
the
monarchy
into
the
political
domain
but
having
done
so
I
think
that
they
risk
losing
the
support
of
a
lot
of
their
voters
he
said
Although
their
activists
are
leftwing
their
Labour
voters
are
usually
in
my
experience
very
conservative
very
pro-monarchy
very
pro-Britain
Mr
Lilley's
comments
echoed
those
of
the
Prime
Minister
who
gave
notice
last
week
that
the
Tories
intended
to
make
Labour's
constitutional
proposals
one
of
the
battlegrounds
at
the
next
election
Michael
Heseltine
President
of
the
Board
of
Trade
was
reported
as
saying
In
its
desperation
to
find
some
new
policy
ground
Labour
has
descended
to
undermining
the
very
fabric
of
our
political
constitution
John
Major
said
Labour's
plans
were
a
sort
of
teenage
madness
and
their
proposals
for
separate
assemblies
for
Scotland
and
Wales
would
lead
to
the
break
up
of
the
United
Kingdom
Since
last
year
only
three
members
of
the
Royal
Family
the
Queen
the
Duke
of
Edinburgh
and
Queen
Elizabeth
the
Queen
Mother
are
supported
by
the
Civil
List
All
other
working
royals
have
their
expenses
paid
from
the
Queen's

about

Tories
face
defeat
over
VAT
as
rebel
MPs
remain
defiant
SENIOR
Tory
ministers
faced
up
last
night
to
the
prospect
of
a
Commons
defeat
this
week
over
VAT
on
fuel
as
they
admitted
that
backbench
dissidents
are
resisting
pressure
to
back
away
from
rebellion
Kenneth
Clarke
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
will
lead
a
final
hour
offensive
to
try
to
persuade
a
hard
core
of
Tory
MPs
that
they
could
severely
damage
the
Government
by
rebelling
over
the
introduction
of
the
second
stage
of
VAT
on
fuel
taking
it
to
per
cent
The
danger
of
defeat
in
tomorrow's
vote
coincided
with
the
threat
of
new
trouble
over
the
nine
rebels
who
had
the
whip
withdrawn
last
week
While
rightwingers
called
for
the
Eurosceptic
dissidents
to
be
allowed
back
into
the
fold
quickly
a
government
source
said
last
night
it
was
quite
inconceivable
that
the
whip
will
be
handed
back
before
Christmas
Senior
Tories
are
aware
that
too
hasty
a
reprieve
would
aggravate
many
backbenchers
who
remained
loyal
despite
having
doubts
over
the

to
vote

Powell
have
been

that
Sir
Richard
Body
is
also

to
vote

Up
to
ten
MPs
have
indicated
they
will
abstain
Labour
claim
the
vote
is
on
a
knife
edge
after
the
nine
Ulster
Unionist
MPs
said
they
would
vote
against
the
Government
Tony
Marlow
and
Michael
Carttiss
two
of
those
who
lost
the
party
whip
last
week
after
voting
against
the
Government
over
raising
Britain's
European
Union
contributions
are
among
those
thought
most
likely
to
abstain
Five
other
rebels
are
thought
likely
to
vote
with
the
Government
tomorrow
But
other
potential
rebels
on
the
VAT
issue
are
Phil
Gallie
Ann
Winterton
Sir
Rhodes
Boyson
Vivian
Bendall
and
Paul
Marland
Nicholas
Fairbairn
who
is
ill
in
Scotland
is

to
attend
Although
tomorrow's
vote
on
a
Labour

is
procedural
defeat
for
the

would
set

a
further
vote
next
month
on
whether

full
VAT

should
be

in

Most
worrying
for
the
Government
is
the
lasting
effect
that
defeat
would
have
on
the
City
as
ministers
fear
that
a
reverse
on
a
key
part
of
economic
policy
could
spark
a
run
on
sterling
One
senior
minister
said
last
night
This
is
not
an
idle
threat
to
scare
the
rebels
We
genuinely
think
it
will
happen
The
row
with
the
Tory
rebels
was
inflamed
when
Kenneth
Baker
a
former
Conservative
party
chairman
accused
Mr
Major
of
committing
an
act
of
crass
stupidity
in
withdrawing

The

A

issued
earlier
this
year
by
the
British
publisher
Dorling
Kindersley
could
not
bring
itself
to
describe
Mary
as
a
virgin
but
referred
to
her
instead
as
a
girl

not

undermining
one
of
the
basic

illustrated

Although
the

is
generally
regarded
as

than

even
the
General

Church
of
England
has
been
divided
on
whether
to

the

Conservatives

believe

THE
Government's
chances
of
averting
an
embarrassing
Commons
defeat
over
VAT
on
domestic
fuel
remained
on
a
knife
edge
last
night
after
at
least
Tory
MPs
indicated
reluctance
to
support
the
measure
Ministers
said
defeat
could
make
interest
rates
rise
The
Government's
present
majority
is
counting
the
nine
MPs
who
no
longer
have
the
Conservative
whip
The
VAT
rebellion
appeared
to
be
gathering
strength
as
Tory
MPs
who
defied
the
Government
over
increased
payments
to
the
European
Union
claimed
strong
public
support
for
their
stand
against
what
they
saw
as
unpopular
policies
Tensions
within
the
party
were
heightened
further
when
Mr
John
Major
rebuffed
demands
by
Right-wing
MPs
endorsed
yesterday
by
a
prominent
Eurosceptic
minister
Mr

for

and
stressed
Mr

was
determined
they
would
have
to
demonstrate
an
improved
voting
record
over
a
period
of
several
months
Ministers
yesterday
embarked
on
a
last-ditch
effort
to
persuade
the
opponents
of
the
increase
in
VAT
on
fuel
to
per
cent
from
next
April
to
fall
into
line
before
tomorrow's
vote
at
the
end
of
the
five-day
Budget
debate
They
warned
them
that
defeat
for
the
Government
on
a
procedural
motion
paving
the
way
for
a
formal
vote
on
whether
the
second
stage
of
VAT
should
go
ahead
would
undermine
confidence
in
the

The
Ulster
Unionists
who
backed
Mr
Major
in
last
week's
Eurovote
have
said
they
will
oppose
VAT
on
fuel
It
would
take
seven
Tories
voting
against
for
the
Government
to
lose
or
abstentions
Tory
whips
believe
they
may
be
able
to
turn
some
of
the
rebels
But
they
acknowledged
last
night
that
the
result
would
be
extremely
close
and
any
Government
majority
was
likely
to
be
in
single
figures
The
rebels
have
been
taking
soundings
in
their
constituencies
over
the
weekend
Last
night
some
said
they
found
that
public
support
for
preventing
VAT

fuel
rising
to
per
cent
was
even
more
pronounced
than
on
the
opposition
to
extra
money
for
Brussels
Mr
Carttiss
said
My
constituents
and

are
urging
me
to
vote
against
the
Government
The
Government
is
out
of
touch
with
real
people
Although
Mr
Major
has
signalled
in
advance
that
tomorrow's
vote
will
not
be
a
confidence
issue
it
will
be
a
key

Peace
plan

BRITAIN

France
launched
a
despairing
effort
yesterday
to
persuade
the
warring
parties
in
Bosnia
to
abandon
the
battlefield
for
the
negotiating
table
Mr
Douglas
Hurd
the
Foreign
Secretary
and
M
Alain
Jupp
his
French
counterpart
met
President
Milosevic
of
Serbia
to
encourage
him
to
bring
more
pressure
on
the
Serbs
in
Bosnia
to
accept
the
improved
peace
plan
offered
by
the
international
community
This
would
give
per
cent
of
Bosnia
to
the
Serbs
and
the
rest
to
the
Muslims
and
Croats
The
Serbs
would
have
the
right
to
form
a
special
relationship
with
Serbia
proper
Afterwards
Mr
Milosevic
whose
commitment
to
the
peace
process
had
come
into
question
recently
backed
the
proposals
and
said
he
was
convinced
that
the

All

called

However
there
is
little

that

Serbs
are
in
any
mood
for
compromise
or
that
Mr
Milosevic
is
in

coerce
them
British
officials
were
playing
down
the
prospect
that
UN
troops
could
be
withdrawn
from

in

next

being
used
as

chip

is
whether

an
acceptable

Labour
in
row
over
Royal
role
THE
LABOUR
leadership
was
embroiled
last
night
in
controversy
over
the
future
of
the
monarchy
after
Mr
Jack
Straw
the
party's
home
affairs
spokesman
outlined
proposals
to
redefine
the
Queen's
role
and
reduce
the
size
of
the
Royal
Family
Ministers
claimed
that
Labour's
plans
for
constitutional
reform
including
a
Scandinavian-style
monarchy
with
less
pomp
and
ceremony
could
lead
to
the
break-up
of
the
United
Kingdom
and
would
be
one
of
the
central
battlegrounds
at
the
next
general
election
Mr
Peter
Lilley
the
Social
Security
Secretary
accused
the
Opposition
leadership
of
promising
to
downgrade
the
monarchy
in
order
to
pander
to
Left-wing
elements
He
pledged
the
Conservatives
would
vigorously
defend
the
Queen
and
the
Royal
Family
from
Labour's
attacks
But
Mr
Straw
said
he
had
the
full
backing
of
Mr
Tony
Blair
the
Labour
leader
and
said
the
party
was
in
tune
with
public
thinking
on
the
future
of
the
monarchy
He
said
a
Labour
government
would
substantially
change
the
constitutional
position
of
the
Royal
Family
in
its
first
term
of
office
In
a
BBC
Panorama
programme
to
be
shown
tonight
he
argued
that
Labour's
plans
to
remove
the
right
of
hereditary
peers
to
sit
and
vote
in
the
House
of
Lords
would
make
a
big
difference
in
the
public's
perception
of
the
monarchy
I
think
it
will
hasten
the
process
towards
a
more
Scandinavian
monarchy
a
monarch
symbolising
a
much
more
classless
society
someone
who
is
above
the
political
battle
than
has
been
the
case
hitherto
he
said
Mr
Straw
criticised
the
Prince
of
Wales
for
being
too
strident
in
the
way
he
expressed
his
views
and
warned
that
his
outspoken
style
might
not
be
appropriate
when
he
is
king
Labour's
changes
would
also
mean
a
reduction
in
the
size
of
the
Royal
Family
that
could
be
cut
from
the
present
people
entitled
to
be
called
His
or
Her
Royal
Highness
to
around
with
just
five
or
six
performing
official
duties
Mr
Straw
said
he
wanted
to
redefine
the
role
of
the
monarchy
Party
officials
said
this
was
not
an
attack
on
the
Queen
but
an
attempt
to
prevent
governments
using
the
authority
of
the
Queen
through
the
Royal
Prerogative
to
by-pass
Parliament
Constitutional
reform
has
now
emerged
as
one
of
the
key
policy
differences
between
Labour
and
the
Conservatives
Last
week
Mr
Major
launched
an
outspoken
attack
on
Labour's
plans
for
a
Scottish
Parliament
and
Welsh
Assembly
reforming
the
House
of
Lords
and
considering
proportional
representation
He
described
them
as
teenage
madness
which
would
spell
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
Britain
Tory
strategists
are
preparing
to
play
the
constitutional
card
in
the
run
up
to
the
next
election
believing
Labour
will
be
vulnerable
to
public
concern
about
such
upheaval
The
sensitivity
of
the
issue
was
reflected
by
Labour's
reaction
to
weekend
headlines
suggesting
it
planned
to
strip
the
Queen
of
political
power
A
party
spokesman
said
there
was
no
intention
of
abolishing
the
monarchy
nor
had
there
been
any
change
in
party
policy
The
changes
to
the
monarchy
should
be
seen
as
part
of
a
package
of
wider
constitutional
reform
The
monarchy
had
already
undergone
change
such
as
the
Queen
paying
tax
and
the
Prince
of
Wales
had
revealed
in
the
recent
authorised
biography
by
Jonathan
Dimbleby
that
he
believed
the
monarchy
must
be
scaled
down
if
it
is
to
survive
into
the
st
century
If
John
Major
wants
to
make
a
big
issue
of
constitutional
reform
Tony
Blair
is
happy
to
take
him
on
said
the
Labour
spokesman
Mr
Straw
himself
has
previously
argued
that
the
Royal
Family
must
choose
between
retreating
into
isolation
and
the
old
hierarchical
order
or
seeking
to
become
more
like
a
normal
family
Ms
Marjorie
Mowlam
shadow

Secretary
has
called
for
a
people's
palace
to
house
the
Queen's
family
with
Windsor
Castle
and
Buckingham
Palace
being
sold
off
But
Mr
Lilley
said
Labour
tactics
could
prompt
many
ordinary
people
who
would
otherwise
support
Labour
to
turn
to
the
Conservatives
I
regret
very
much
that
they
have
put
the
future
of
the
monarchy
into
the
political
domain
he
said
on
BBCl's
Breakfast
with
Frost
But
having
done
so
I
think
that
they
risk
losing
the
support
of
a
lot
of
their
voters
While
Labour
activists
were
Left-wing
Labour
voters
were
usually
very
pro-monarchy
very
pro-Britain
and
the
Conservatives
would
vigorously
defend
the
Queen
and
the
Royal
Family
Having
abandoned
its
policies
on
the
economy
and
education
Labour
desperately
needed
something
new
to
please
the
Left

soon
reduced

he
said
as

died
away
I

because
I

all

The

then
tried

from

into

saying

The

it
is
a

to
think

the

the

Any

TONY
BLAIR
has
ordered
Labour
to
speed
up
preparations
for
a
general
election
amid
signs
that
the
Prime
Minister
is
increasingly
anxious
to
bring
the
Euro-rebels
back
into
the
Tory
parliamentary
fold
The
Labour
leader
wants
a
quick
replacement
for
Clause
which
commits
the
party
to
nationalisation
A
special
conference
to
approve
a
new
version
could
be
held
as
early
as
Easter
Mr
Blair
has
also
asked
for
work
on
tax
employment
and
welfare
policies
to
be
stepped
up
for

The

a

by
another
poll
showing
that
the

is
set
to
lose
the

by-election
on
Thursday
by
a
huge
margin
The
poll
for
GMTV's

showed
Labour
with
a
per
cent
lead
and
only
per
cent
of
the
electors
saying

More
than
half

that
John

should
step
down
At
the
general
election
the
late
Dr
John
Blackburn
retained
the
seat
for
the
Tories
with
a
majority
The
jittery
condition
of
the
British
Government
was
highlighted
at
the
European
Council
summit
in
Essen
where
both
Mr
Major
and
Douglas
Hurd
the
Foreign
Secretary
called
for
consultation
and
discussion
on
the
merits
of
a
single
currency
Mr
Major
warned
yesterday
of
the
dangers
of
Britain
being
left
behind
if
a
group
of
European
Union
members
pushed
ahead
with
a
single
currency
Nobody
could
be
certain
he
said
of
the
economic
impact
on
the
UK
But
at
a
dinner
for
heads
of
government
on
Friday
night
he
struck
a
much
more
Eurosceptical
tone
It
was
doubtful
he
argued
that
the
member
states
could
achieve
a
single
currency
by
the
end
of
the
century
He
added
that
the
EU's
objectives
were
no
longer
clear
and
that
it
had
lost
touch
with
ordinary
people
And
on
Radio
s
Today
programme
Mr
Major
gave
the
Eurosceptics
in
his
party
further
encouragement
The
timescale
for
the
introduction
of
a
single
currency
set
out
at
Maastricht
was
not
going
to
be
met
he
said
He
added
I
have
not
ruled
out
the
prospect
of
a
referendum
His
comments
increased
speculation
that
the
eight
Eurorebels
who
lost
the
Conservative
whip
may
soon
be
re-admitted
to
the
parliamentary
party
Several
MPs
welcomed
what
the
Prime
Minister
said
One
Euro-sceptic
leader
Sir
Teddy
Taylor
MP
for
Southend
described
it
as
a
step
in
the
right
direction
However
one
rebel
Michael
Cartiss
said
the
Prime
Minister's
move
to
postpone
a
single
European
currency
beyond
was
not
an
olive
branch
It
was
simply
a
recognition
of
practicalities
Another
rebel
who
declined
to
be
named
said
they
need
us
more
than
we
need
them
and
called
for
Mr
Hurd's
removal

The
Tory
turbulence
over
Europe
will
heighten
Mr
Blair's
desire
to
prepare
his
party
for
an
early
election
He
thinks
the
party's
policies
need
much
more
work
before
it
puts
its
case
to
the
country
Tax
reform
is
one
area
where
Mr
Blair
wants
to
speed
up
policy-making
adding
more
detail
to
Labour
commitments
to
close
abuses
and
loopholes
and
to
review
corporate
and
environmental
taxation
He
also
wants
to
develop
policies
for
job
creation
and
the
information
super-highway
and
improving
education
standards
The
selection
of
candidates
which
has
been
delayed
by
the
Boundary
Commission
will
also
be
given
priority
and
Labour
aims
to
have

marginals

THE
IRA'S
ceasefire
has
a
better
than
even
chance
of
lasting
at
least
until
next
Easter
according
to
the
private
assessment
of
the
head
of
the
Royal
Ulster
Constabulary
Sir
Hugh
Annesley
The
RUC
chiefs
view
is
that
the
ceasefire
has
a
chance
of
lasting
until
next
Easter
and
if
it
does
the
police
calculate
its
prospects
beyond
that
date
are
much
brighter
Sir
Hugh
gave
his
assessment
last
Monday
in
advance
of
the
opening
of
the
talks
between
Sinn
Fein
and
British
Government
which
the
ceasefire
has
facilitated
He
told
a
dozen
selected
journalists
in
an
unattributable
briefing
at
RUC
headquarters
in
Belfast
that
he
believed
the
IRA
would
review
the
situation
around
Easter
assessing
what
progress
Sinn
Fein
had
made
in
the
political
arena
According
to
sources
who
were
present
Sir
Hugh
was
noticeably
more
relaxed
on
the
issue
of
the
IRA
handing
in
its
weaponry
than
the
Government
appeared
to
be
last
week
When
Sinn
Fein
members
met
the
Government
team
at
Stormont
on
Friday
the
delegation
led
by
Martin
McGuinness
was
told
the
retention
of
weaponry
by
the
IRA
would
constitute
a
barrier
to
substantive
negotiations
By
contrast
Sir
Hugh
told
journalists
that
much
IRA
weaponry
was
home-made
note
desc="discuss">
implying
that
even
if
its
equipment
were
handed
over
the
organisation
could
at
any
future
stage
resume
production
of
weapons
such
as
mortars
and
rockets
He
confirmed
reports
that
the
IRA
was
continuing
to
size
up
targets
and
was
carrying
on
with
many
of
its
traditional
activities
apart
from
actually
carrying
out
attacks
On
policing
he
was
concerned
that
no
deals
should
be
made
behind
closed
doors
saying
that
there
should
instead
be
open
debate
on
how
Northern
Ireland
would
be
policed
in
future
He
left
the
impression
that
he
believed
the
Government
should
not
have
placed
such
stress
on
pressing
republicans
to
use
the
word
permanent
in
relation
to
the
IRA
cessation
of
violence
which
was
announced
on
August
and
indicated
that
the
RUC
had
been
pleasantly
surprised
that
the
cessation
statement
went
as
far
as
it
did
On
the
question
of
guns
his
thinking
was
that
what
mattered
most
was
not
the
possession
of
weaponry
but
the
will
to
use
it
Sir
Hugh's
view
was
that
the
important
point
was
to
keep
the
peace
process
going
as
long
as
possible
and
to
make
it
as
much
of
a
fudge
as
possible
He
cautioned
against
ministers
forcing
the
pace
His
view
was
that
the
longer
the
ceasefire
went
on
the
less
chance
there
was
that
the
IRA
campaign
would
resume

Non

M
JACQUES
DELORS
outgoing
president
of
the
European
Commission
and
bogeyman
of
British
Euro-sceptics
gave
up
the
near
certainty
of
becoming
president
of
France
when
he
announced
last
night
that
he
would
not
contest
the
presidential
election
next
spring
M
Delors
who
was
six
points
clear
of
his
main
rival
in
the
opinion
polls
ended
months
of
speculation
during
a
live
television
interview
His
election
would
have
meant
that
when
the
Maastricht
Treaty
is
reviewed
in
Britain
would
have
faced
a
federalist
Chancellor
Kohl
in
the
German
corner
and
an
even
more
federalist
M
Delors
in
the
French
seat
His
decision
not
to
contest
the
election
has
dealt
the
federalist
cause
a
severe
blow
without
him
as
leader
of
France
to
replace
M
Francois
Mitterrand
the
Franco-German
axis
may
lose
force
But
the
heaviest
blow
is
to
the
Left
M
Delors
had
promised
to
give
his
decision
before
Christmas
so
that
the
Socialist
Party
would
have
time
to
find
someone
else
But
the
Left
has
no
other
obvious
candidate
M
Delors
cited
personal
reasons
the
fact
that
he
will
be
next
year
and
that
he
had
worked
ceaselessly
for
years
His
wife
Marie
is
believed
to
have
worried
about
his
health
and
argued
for
retirement
He
now
wanted
a
career
better
balanced
between
reflection
and
action
he
said
He
also
said
that
the
absence
of
a
Left-wing
majority
in
parliament
to
help
him
carry
out
the
reforms
he
believed
France
needed
led
him
to
his
difficult
decision
Although
the
opinion
polls
suggest
that
he
would
have
beaten
M
Edouard
Balladur
the
Gaullist
prime
minister
by
per
cent
to
per
cent
in
the
second
round
of
the
presidential
contest
they
also
showed
that
the
country
had
no
wish
to
see
a
return
of
the
Left
to
overall
power
This
would
have
meant
cohabitation
between
a
Leftist
president
and
a
Rightist
legislature
M
Delors
said
that
he
had
no
wish
to
work
with
a
government
that
does
not
reflect
my
ideas
The
best
he
could
have
hoped
for
was
to
gain
the
support
of
some
key
centrists
Ex-president
Valery
Giscard
d'Estaing
had
discreetly
offered
his
backing
and
M
Raymond
Barre
a
former
prime
minister
is
a
friend
Both
might
have
served
in
a
cohabitation
government
However
the
Gaullists
would
have
been
bound
to
dominate
and
the
ideas
of
M
Balladur
and
M
Alain
Jupp
the
foreign
minister
on
Europe
are
much
closer
to
those
of
Mr
John
Major
than
to
M
Delors
Last
night
M
Delors
attacked
M
Balladur's
idea
of
a
Europe
of
circles
in
which
each
member
country
could
progress
at
its
own
speed
We
have
to
have
political
cement
he
said
M
Jack
Lang
the
former
Socialist
culture
minister
expressed
his
shock
and
profound
sadness
at
M
Delors's
announcement
He
respected
the
decision
but
he
regretted
it
The
same
shock

DELORS'S
decision
not
to
stand
was
hailed
by
Tories
as
a
major
boost
for
the
Government
and
a
turning
point
for
Britain
in
Europe
Senior
Tories
said
it
would
enhance
Mr
Major's
hopes
of
moving
the
debate
away
from
closer
European
union
towards
independently
evolving
nation
states
Privately
ministers
have
also
welcomed
the
news
which
they
believe
makes
it
more
likely
that
M
Edouard
Balladur
the
Right-wing
French
prime
minister
will
win
the
presidency
Many
feel
that
M
Balladur
shares
much
of
Mr
Major's
broad
outlook
on
the
future
of
Europe
There
had
been
concern
that
M
Delors
could
reignite
the
French
Left
standing
almost
above
party
on
his
reputation
of
battling
for
France
in
Europe
However
ministers
always
harboured
less
fear
of
M
Delors
than
did
the
Tory
rank
and
file
Friends
of
Mr
Hurd
said
he
had
never
felt
intimidated
by
M
Delors
because
he
was
transparent
in
his
views
and
open
in
fighting
his
corner
Mr
Hurd
also
believed
that
the
decision
would
not
greatly
alter
the
course
of
French
foreign
policy
If
the
Left
had
won
M
Delors
might
have
been
a
significant
figure
in
any
administration
Mr
Tristan
Garel-Jones
former
European
affairs
minister
said
the
decision
meant
that
new
ideas
for
the
way
the
European
Union
should
develop
will
fall
on
more
fertile
ground
Mr
John
Townend
a
member
of
the
Committee
said
This
could
be
a
turning
point
for
the
Government
Now
there
is
a
much
greater
possibility
that
the
Prime
Minister's
view
of
a
Europe
of
nation
states
will
become
the
accepted
view
Sceptics
were
less
impressed
Sir
Teddy
Taylor
the
MP
for
Southend
East
said
it
made
little
difference
who
stood
This
is
entirely
a
matter
for
the
French
he
said
It
does
not
make
any
difference

always
played

Get
into
line
with
party
Major
is
told
MR
MICHAEL
Portillo
gave
warning
yesterday
that
the
Tory
right
could
not
be
united
until
its
rebel
MPs
were
restored
to
the
whip
and
a
firmly
sceptical
stance
on
European
integration
and
a
single
currency
were
adopted
by
the
Government
Interviewed
on
the
Breakfast
with
Frost
programme
the
Employment
Secretary
said
I
understand
that
we
need
to
heal
the
party
I
understand
that
they
are
looking
for
reassurance
that
we
are
not
going
to
take
further
steps
towards
the
political
union
of
Europe
Although
he
delivered
a
strong
appeal
for
calm
reflection
and
for
a
healing
process
Mr
Portillo
markedly
refused
to
back
Mr
Major's
decision
to
withdraw
the
party
whip
from
his
rebels
Asked
repeatedly
if
he
agreed
with
the
withdrawal
of
the
whip
Mr
Portillo
said
The
Prime
Minister
felt
it
very
strongly
and
I
do
understand
this
It
is
the
right
decision
if
the
Prime
Minister
believes
he
has
given
his
word
It
is
the
right
decision
for
him
The
Prime
Minister
felt
very
upset
with
the
rebels
This
implicit
pressure
on
Mr
Major
to
get
into
line
with
his
party
came
at
the
start
of
what
is
likely
to
be
another
miserable
week
for
the
Prime
Minister
On
Wednesday
he
faces
a
knife-edge
vote
on
Spanish
fishing
rights
with
Tories
threatening
to
side
with
Labour
and
on
Thursday
the
Conservatives
are
expecting
a
crushing
defeat
in
the
Dudley
West
by-election
Mr

comments
also
emphasised
the

in

AN

scientist
who
was
shot
dead
as
he
made
tea
in
his
kitchen
dialled
before
he
died
but
was
unable
to
speak
to
the

Police
traced
the
call
from
Dr
Michael
Meenaghan
after
the
operator
heard
groans
and
laboured
breathing
Officers
broke
in
to
the
locked
house
after
seeing
his
body
on
the
kitchen
floor
They
found
the
telephone
still
off
the
hook
Dr
Meenaghan
was
an
expert
on
genetic
fingerprinting
used
to
identify
rapists
and
murderers
and
had
been
involved
in
projects
to

Inspector

A
colleague
said
the
work
was
non-controversial
and
he
could
think
of
no
reason
why
Dr
Meenaghan
had
been
killed
I
saw
him
on
Friday
and
he
seemed
his
normal
self
said
Mr
Timothy
Beesley
who
worked
in
the

department
Dr

also

medical

at

Dr
Meenaghan
who
lived
on
a
private
part
of
the
Blackbird
Leys
estate
in
Oxford
had
been
hit
in
the
chest
by
a
single
shotgun
blast
from
outside
his
kitchen
window
on
Saturday
afternoon
Neighbours
said
that
in
recent
weeks
he
had
kept
his
doors
locked
even
when
at
home
and
would
keep
his
curtains
drawn
all
day
He
had
also
changed
his
telephone
number
made
it
ex-directory
and
kept
a
sheet
draped
across
a
bedroom
window
The
killer
had
used
an
alleyway
next
to
the
house
to
reach
the
kitchen
window
and
shot
Dr
Meenaghan
as
he
stood
by
the
sink
Police
said
there
was
no
evidence
to
suggest
it
was
the
work
of
a
contract
killer
but
were
not
ruling
out
any
possibilities
Dr
Meenaghan
was
said
by
neighbours
to
have
had
a
tangled
love-life
with
one
woman
who
was
believed
locally
to
have
been
his
wife
moving
out
of
the
house
in
April
after
arriving
with
him
five
years
ago
A
woman
and
her
son
moved
in
soon
afterwards
but
they
left
the
house
a
few
weeks
later
and
Dr
Meenaghan
had
since
been
living
alone
Detectives
said
that
Dr
Meenaghan
was
thought
not
to
have
married
and
were
studying
letters
found
at
the
house
which
suggested
there
may

would

he
was
shot
from
outside
the
window
which
was
either
broken
by
the

or
before
the

JACQUES
DELORS
announced
last
night
that
he
would
not
be
a
candidate
in

presidential
election
leaving

reeling
The

now
has
almost
no

of
holding

Mr

also
leaves

those
European
leaders
who
were
counting
on
him
to
defend
his
vision
of
the
continent's
future
from
the
Elyse
Palace
The
outgoing
European
Commission
president
read
out
a
statement
during
a
current
affairs
programme
on
French
television
saying
he
did
not
feel
he
would
be
able
to
rally
a
sympathetic
majority
and
that
at
the
age
of
he
had
to
take
the
personal
toll
of
a
presidential
candidacy
into
account
The
question
for
me
was
whether
if
I
were
elected
president
I
would
have
the
political
means
at
my
disposal
to
carry
out
indispensable
reforms
Mr
Delors
said
After
long
reflection
and
consultation
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
lack
of
a
majority
to
support
my
policies
would
not
allow
me
to
achieve
my
aims
He
said
it
would
not
be
honest
to
make
promises
which
he
could
not
deliver
calculating
that
the
right
would
maintain
a
majority
in
parliament
even
if
new
polls
were
held
next
year
The
disappointments
of
tomorrow
would
be
worse
than
the
regrets
of
today
Mr
Delors
said
His
decision
brought
an
end
to
weeks
of
speculation
about
his
intentions
but
threw
the
presidential
race
which
all
the
opinion
polls
had
said
he
was
leading
comfortably
into
deep
confusion
The
left
still
smarting
from
its
resounding
defeat
in
last
year's
general
election
now
has
no
credible
candidate
I
feel
great
pain
and
great
sadness
I
can
hardly
believe
it
said
a
shaken
Jack
Lang
the
former
Socialist
culture
minister
Mr
Lang
along
with
other
party
stalwarts
such
as
Pierre
Mauroy
or
Lionel
Jospin
may
now
be
a
candidate
himself
However
none
looks
likely
to
make
an
impression
on
voters
The
presidential
race
is
more
likely
to
amount
to
a
contest
on
the
centre-right
between
the
Gaullist
leader
Jacques
Chirac
and
the
prime
minister
Edouard
Balladur
Mr
Delors
who
steps
down
as
European
Commission
president
in
January
suggested
he
would
not
retire
but
would
lead
a
life
more
balanced
between
reflection
and
action
He
can
expect
to
be
attacked
for
a
lack
of
nerve
and
the
apparent
lack
of
ambition
which
has
characterised
his

We
should
avert
a
breakdown
in

However
the
assault
marks
the
parting
of
the
ways
between
Mr
Yeltsin
and
his
last
bastion
of
support
in
parliament
the
liberal
Russia's
Choice
faction
of
Yegor
Gaidar
A
military
action
in
Chechenia
means
war
Mr
Gaidar
said
An
attack
on
Grozny
today
means
the
death
of
Russia's
democracy
tomorrow
Several
hundred
people
rallied
against
Mr
Yeltsin's
Caucasus
policy
in
central
Moscow
yesterday
the
first
significant
anti-Yeltsin
rally
by
reformist
liberals
Chechenia
declared
independence
from
the
Russian
Federation
in
but
Russia
and
foreign
governments
have
never
recognised
its
sovereignty
The
assault
is
therefore
not
technically
an
invasion
In
a
written
appeal
to
the
Yeltsin
flexes
might
by
invading
rebel
republic
peoples
of
Russia
and
the
Caucausus
President
Dudayev
said

We
still
have
enough
strength
to
prevent
a
bloody
blanket
being
thrown
over
the
Caucasus
and
the
whole
of
Russia

wrote
The
international
community
is
likely
to
believe
Moscow
has
the
right
to
restore
control
over
a
part
of
the

The
Russian

Valentin
Sergeyev
said
Grozny
would
not
be
stormed
and
there
would

nightfall

According

POLICE
investigating
the
murder
of
an
Oxford
University
lecturer
were
last
night
still
baffled
as
to
the
motive
despite
claims
by
neighbours
that
the
year-old
Scot
had
recently
stepped
up
security
at
his
home
Michael
Meenaghan
who
taught
at
the
Sir
William
Dunn
School
of
Pathology
was
thought
to
have
been
shot
by
a
contract
killer
as
he
made
tea
at
his
terrace
house
on
the
Blackbird
Leys
estate
in
Oxford
Police
were
alerted
by
a
call
from
his
phone
on
Saturday
at
pm
A
spokesman
said
no
speech
was
heard
but
the
sound
of
someone
struggling
for
breath
could
be
made
out
in
the
background
Officers
discovered
Dr
Meenaghan's
body
on
the
kitchen
floor
after
they
forced
an
entry
into
his
house
The
post
mortem
showed
that
he
died
of
a
shotgun
wound
to
his
chest
Detective
Superintendent
Jon
Bound
of
Thames
Valley
police
who
is
leading
the
investigation
said
Dr
Meenaghan
had
lived
at
the
house
for
five
years
most
recently
alone
but
we
are
still
trying
to
establish
his
marital
status
and
are
interviewing
colleagues
and
friends
At
this
stage
we
know
of
no
motive
for
this
brutal
murder
It
looks
like
a
contract
killing
but
we
are
keeping
an
open
mind
A
kitchen
window
at
the
back
of
the
house
was
smashed
The
gunman
either
shot
him
through
the
window
or
smashed
the
window
and
pointed
his
gun
through
it
said
Mr
Bound
He
added
that
he
had
no
evidence
that
Dr
Meenaghan
had
recently
become
concerned
for
his
safety
despite
repeated
claims
by
neighbours
that
the
doctor
had
stepped
up
security
having
switched
to
an
ex-directory
phone
number
and
always
keeping
the
curtains
drawn
and
the
doors
locked
Detectives
were
known
to
have
examined
a
series
of
letters
found
in
Dr
Meenaghan's
house
which
suggested
a
series
of
relationships
he
had
had
with
women
The
fatal
gunshot
was
heard
by
neighbours
Henry
Sherriff
said
I
heard
a
loud
bang
come
from
his
house
I
was
decorating
in
our
back
room
at
the
time
and
I
thought
at
first
it
was
a
car
backfiring
It
didn't
strike
me
that
it
was
a
gun
although
it
sounded
very
close
The
next
thing
we
heard
was
a
police
helicopter
and
saw
the
ambulance
arrive
I
cannot
think
why
anyone
would
have
wanted
to
shoot
him
He
was
a
very
pleasant
man
who
often
chatted
to
our
kids
I
cannot
imagine
him
having
any
enemies
Another
neighbour
who
did
not
want
to
be
named
said
he
had
worked
with
Dr
Meenaghan
for
several
months
at
the
school
of
pathology
He
was
the
last
person
you
would
expect
anyone
to
attack
it
is
a
real
mystery
Tim
Beesley
a
colleague
at
the
School
of
Pathology
said
the
doctor
known
to
his
friends
as
Spike
spent
the
last
four
years
researching
molecular
biology
He
said
I
am
stunned
by
what
has
happened
and
just
can't
take
it
in
The
circumstances
of
his
death
are
very
strange
and
I
can't
think
what
is
behind
it
His
research
was
quite
straightforward
and
certainly
not
controversial
Dr
Meenaghan
was
believed
to
have
only
one
living
relative
an
elderly
mother
who
has
been
told
Mr

also
a

Biggest
British
winner
at
gambling
is
one
person
not
a
syndicate
say
the
organisers
THE
winner
of
Britain's
largest
ever
gambling
prize
was
discovered
last
night
by
Camelot
organisers
of
the
National
Lottery
After
sifting
through
a
handful
of
hoaxes
and
false
claims
Camelot
said
We
think
we
have
got
the
winner
It
is
not
a
syndicate
but
one
person
The
winning
ticket
will
be
officially
verified
today
and
the
winner
will
receive
counselling
to
cope
with
the
shock
of
becoming
an
overnight
multi-millionaire
and
the
practicalities
of
handling
such
a

David

said

unless
the
winner
is
unmasked
by

a

about

The
winner
rang
Camelot's
hotline

after
watching
the

shopping
days

More

paid
out
in

and
Camelot

a

million
would
go
to
the

designated

Camelot
is
already
predicting
a

for

Saturday's

Mr
Rigg
denied

of
a

with

over

of

Russians
pit
huge
forces
against
rebels
Launching
its
biggest
military
assault
since
the
invasion
of
Afghanistan
in
Russia
yesterday
poured
hundreds
of
tanks
and
thousands
of
troops
into
the
renegade
region
of
Chechnya
a
wild
cauldron
of
clans
guns
and
a
history
of
rebellion
against
Moscow
The
massive
assault
brought
howls
of
protest
from
liberals
in
Moscow
scattered
resistance
on
the
ground
and
a
plea
for
peace
talks
from
President
Boris
Yeltsin
who
vanished
into
a
hospital
on
the
eve
of
what
could
prove
the
most
perilous
moment
of
his
presidency
As
Russian
forces
streamed
towards
the
capital
of
Grozny
in
three
separate
columns
supported
by
Mi-8
attack
helicopters
and
Su-25
fighters
the
Chechen
leader
Dzhokar
Dudayev
said
the
attack
would

a
bloody
blanket
across

Caucasus

to

in
Moscow
said
the
troops
would
pause
before
entering
Grozny
a
city
of
founded
in
the
last
century
as
a
cossack
fortress
The
name
means
Terrible
or
Fearsome
This
seemed
to
suggest
a
strategy
of
siege
aimed
at
forcing
Mr
Dudayev's
capitulation
without
the
large
loss
of
life
that
a
head
on
assault
would
risk
Interfax
news

reported
that

priority
task
for
Russian
troops
was
an
oil
refinery
outside
Grozny
and

through

it
says

We

Mr
Yeltsin
was
quoted
as
saying
Our
aim
is
to
find
a
political
solution
to
the
problems
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
Russian
federation
and
to
protect
its
citizens

extremism
Russian
liberals
including
some
of
Mr
Yeltsin's
closest
former
allies
such
as
the
former
prime
minister
Yegor
Gaidar
have
denounced
military
action
as
a
threat
not
only
to
lives
in
Chechnya
but
to
Russia's
fledgling
democracy
A
statement
from
Mr
Gaidar's
Russia's
Choice
party
warned
of
a
hardline
ascendancy
in
the
Kremlin
that
dreams
of
murdering
Russia's
democracy

forcing
the
people
back

wire

only
people
turned
out
for
a
demonstration
in
Pushkin
Square
in
central
Moscow
to
protest
against
the
military

Aside
from
Mr
Yeltsin's
brief
appeal
there
was

ominous
silence
from
the
Kremlin

serves
as

country's
commander
in
chief
is
said
by

office
to
have

surgery
to
relieve

trouble
A
statement
on
Saturday
did
not
say
when
the
operation
took
place
but
only
that
recovery
would
take
about
eight
days
during

still
work

not

his

only
two
days
after
his
Defence
Minister
Pavel
Grachev

Mr
Dudayev
and
vowed
not
to
use
force
Mr
Yeltsin
issued
a
decree
ordering
the
use
of
all
means
at
the
disposal
of
the
state
to
tame
Chechnya's
three-year
long
secessionist
rebellion
Mr
Yeltsin
tried
to
impose
a
state
of
emergency
on
Chechnya
when
it
first
broke
with
Moscow
in
but
he
backed
down
after
parliament
refused
to
ratify
the
move
The
main
flash-point
in
the
early
hours
of
yesterday's
invasion
launched
shortly
before
dawn
came
near
the
town
of
Karbulak
a
small
settlement

Noting
that

said
I
have

He
looked
forward
to
a
time
of
reflection
not

Politically
he
spoke
of

from
another

would
have

France

now
living

is
a

to
pick
up
the

from

and
even
the

that
he
might
have
attracted
A
month
ago
Mr
Delors
published
a
book
on
his
views
and
gave
a
series
of
interviews
convincing
many
commentators
that
he
was

to
the
two
Gaullist
contenders

and

The

now
is
for

Oxford
lecturer
Detectives
admitted
to
being
baffled
last
night
over
the
murder
of
an
Oxford
University
lecturer
who
was
shot
through
the
window
of
his
kitchen
as
he
made
a
pot
of
tea
Dr
Michael
Meenaghan's
last
breaths
were
heard
by
emergency
operators
after
he
dialled
but
he
had
died
from
massive
chest
injuries
by
the
time
police
smashed
their
way
into
his
home
He
had
not
been
able
to
give
any
clues
as
to
his
assailant
A
lecturer
at
the
Sir
William
Dunn
School
of
Pathology
at
Oxford
University
Dr
Meenaghan
was
shot
at
about
pm
at
his
end
terrace
home
on
the
Blackbird
Leys
estate
in
Oxford
Police
called
it
an
apparently
motiveless
attack
Neighbours
in
the
street
of
smart
private
houses
said
the
lecturer
had
appeared
nervous
recently
and
had
taken
to
drawing
his
curtains
day
and
night
He
had
draped
a
sheet
across
an
upstairs
window
apparently
as
an
extra
precaution
against
being
seen
Officers
at
the
scene
on
Saturday
said
all
Dr
Meenaghan's
doors
had
been
locked
from
the
inside
He
had
made
his
telephone
ex-directory
within
the
past
months
yet
initial
inquiries
into
his
private
life
are
understood
to
have
found
nothing
other
than
exemplary
behaviour
according
to
one
senior
officer
We're
going
to
have
our
work
cut
out
to
even
find
a
motive
said
the
officer
There
is
nothing
to
indicate
why
Dr
Meenaghan
was
murdered
or
to
suggest
why
anyone
would
want
him
dead
There
was
speculation
last
night
that
the
killing
had
the
hallmarks
of
an
ordered
hit
but
Detective
Superintendent
Jon
Bound
who
is
leading
the
inquiry
was
keeping
an
open
mind
Detectives
are
understood
to
have
studied
a
number
of
letters
that
may
have
thrown
light
on
several
relationships
Dr
Meenaghan
had
had
with
women
He
was
living
alone
at
the
time
of
his
death
Mr
Bound
said
that
the
kitchen
window
of
the
Monks
Close
house
had
been
broken
suggesting
either
that
the
attacker
first
smashed
it
before
shooting
Dr
Meenaghan
or
that
the
gun
was
fired
straight
through
it
He
said
a
call
was
received
after
the
shooting
and
added
The
emergency
call
was
passed
over
to
the
police
No
speech
was
heard
but
someone
struggling
for
breath
could
be
heard
in
the
background
Police
went
to
the
house
and
it
appeared
secure
Looking
through
the
kitchen
window
a
man's
body
was
seen
lying
on
the
floor
Officers
forced
their
way
in
and
the
lifeless
body
of
Dr
Michael
Meenaghan
was
found
A
telephone
in
the
kitchen
was
found
to
be
off
the
hook
and
the
victim
had
been
shot
through
the
chest
A
post-mortem
examination
held
at
the
John
Radcliffe
Hospital
confirmed
the
cause
of
death
as
a
haemorrhage
of
the
chest
Dr
Meenaghan
a
Scot
was
believed
to
have
had
only
one
living
relative
an
elderly
mother
who
is
said
to
be
in
extremely
poor
health
She
has
been
told
of
his
death
by
police
Oxford
University
refused
to
discuss
the
murder
yesterday
but
Tim
Beesley
a
fellow
academic
at
the
School
of
Pathology
said
Dr
Meenaghan
nicknamed
Spike
had
spent
the
past
four
years
researching
molecular
biology
He
said
I
am
stunned
by
what
has
happened
and
just
can't
take
it
in
The
circumstances
of
his
death
are
very
strange
and
I
can't
think
what
is
behind
it
His
research
was
quite
straightforward
and
certainly
not
controversial
I
was
only
speaking
to
him
on
Friday
so
this
is
a
terrible
shock
He
came
in
to
work
in
the
morning
and
we
chatted
and
passed
the
time
of
day
I
saw
him
again
when
I
left
in
the
afternoon
and
he
just
seemed
his
normal
self
Spike
was
quite
a
character
and
well
liked
in
the
department
He
was
originally
from
Glasgow
and
had
a
great
sense
of
humour
I
wasn't
a
close
friend
but
he
didn't
seem
to
be
troubled
or
to
have
any
particular
personal
problems
Neighbours
of
the
lecturer
described
him
as
a
pleasant
quiet
man
who
wore
his
grey
hair
in
a
ponytail
and
chatted
regularly
to
local
children
One
who
asked
not
to
be
named
said
he
had
worked
for
several
months
with
Dr
Meenaghan
at
the
school
of
pathology
He
said
I
didn't
get
to
know
him
very
well
but
he
always
seemed
like
a
very
nice
bloke
and
would
always
say
hello
He
always
seemed
pretty
cheerful
He
was
the
last
person
you
would
expect
anyone
to
attack
it's
a
real
mystery
Henry
Sherriff
who
lives
four
doors
away
said
I
can't
think
why
anyone
would
have
wanted
to
shoot
him
He
was
a
very
pleasant
man
who
often
chatted
to
our
kids
I
can't
imagine
him
having
any
enemies

David

the

THOUSANDS
of
Russian
troops
in
tanks
and
armoured
vehicles
invaded
the
breakaway
republic
of
Chechenia
yesterday
as
Moscow
tried
to
use
military

to
reimpose
authority
over
its
most
rebellious
possession
In
a
three-pronged
dawn
operation
armoured
columns
of
Interior
Ministry
troops
converged
on
the
Chechen
capital
Grozny
where
the
rebel
government
led
by
General
Dzhokhar
Dudayev
was
outnumbered
but
defiant
The
troops
have
been
ordered
to
take
control
of
oil
refining
facilities
and
oil
pipelines
running
through
the
rebel
region
Interfax

quoting
an

as
saying
that
the
troops
had
orders
to
ensure
the
safety
of
industrial
enterprises
and
other

around

President
Dudayev
a

general
whose

palace
was

by

of
heavily
armed
supporters
from
elderly
Chechens
in
traditional
fur
hats
to
young

in

said
We
will
defend

Given
the
size
of
the
force
bearing
down
on
Grozny
the
city
was
remarkably
relaxed
last
night
and
no
blackout
was
imposed
The
Chechen
leader
remained
in
his
office
meeting
advisers
while
his
supporters
gathered
around
bonfires
in
the
street
to
keep
warm
Earlier
Chechenia
vowed
that
Russian
troops
would
leave
in
coffins
General
Dudayev's
chief
aide
Movlen
Salamo
said
We
may
be
conquered
but
they
will
take
away
more

Chechens
President
Yeltsin
said
in
a
message
to
the
nation
that
he
had
ordered
his
troops
into
Chechenia
to
protect
civilians
uphold
the
constitution
and
help
to
find
a
political
solution
His
assurances
did
little
to
ease
concerns
however
that
the
country
was
being
dragged
into
a
new
Afghanistan
with
troops
locked
into

Hundreds
of
protesters
and
politicians
gathered
in
central
Moscow
demanding
that
Russia
halt
the
invasion
and
calling
for
the
President's
removal
Sergei
Yushenkov
a
reformist
member
of
the
lower
house
of
parliament
said
impeachment
was
the
only
way
I
see
no
other
way
of
stopping
the
President
he
told
the
demonstrators
Parliament
would
seek
his
removal
he
said
They
are
setting
up
a
commission
to
accuse
the
President
of
inflaming
ethnic
conflicts
provoking
mass
deaths
of
Russian

Mr
Yeltsin's

Yegor

that

the

Emile
Paine
a
member
of

cannot
win
a
victory
over
the
population
The
statements
by
Mr
Yushenkov
and
Mr
Gaidar
leaders
of
Russia's
Choice
caused
Andrei
Kozyrev
the
Foreign
Minister
to
storm
out
of
parliament's
strongest
liberal
faction
saying
his

was
irreversible
Witnesses

The

five

Boris
Agapov

MICHAEL
Portillo
yesterday
laid
down
a
challenge
to

pro-Europeans
by
calling
on
John
Major
to
adopt
a
more
Euro-sceptic
agenda
to
end
the
terrible
rift
raging
within
the
Conservative
Party
At
the

time
the
Cabinet's
leading
rightwinger
appeared
to
put
himself
forward
as
a
peacemaker
in
the
clash
between
Mr
Major
and
the
nine
Conservative
Euro
rebels
even
though
Mr
Major
yesterday
accused
them
of
self-indulgence
and
issued
a
warning
that
unity
could
not
be
achieved
by
appeasement
towards
them
Mr
Portillo
called
for
tolerance
and
a
healing
process
as
the
Prime
Minister
attempted
to
defuse
the
European
timebomb
by
arguing
that
it
was
improbable
if
not
impossible
that
monetary
union
could
be
achieved
by
the
year
The
Employment
Secretary
complicated
the
increasingly
intense
debate
about
a
referendum
on
the
future
of
the
European
Union
given
added
significance
by
the
Prime
Minister's
signal
at
the
European
summit
in
Essen
that
he
was
prepared
to
consider
the
option
by
suggesting
that
it
was
not
his
preferred
way
of
healing
Tory
wounds
on
Europe
Tory
rightwingers
will
tonight
give
renewed
momentum
to
the
referendum
campaign
with
a
debate
in
the
Group
the
largest
backbench
grouping
in
which
Kenneth
Baker
the
former
Home
Secretary
will
be
the
main
speaker
Yesterday
Norman
Lamont
the
former
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
demanded
an
early
referendum
pledge
saying
There
is
a
danger
of
being
second
in
this
race
and
appearing
to
be
forced
into
it
either
by
rebels
or
by
the
Labour
Party
Mr
Portillo
said
it
was
not
his
first
choice
but
conceded
that
many
in
the
Tory
party
saw
it
as
a
way
of
restoring
unity
He
made
plain
however
that
his
answer
was
for
the
Government
as
a
whole
to
become
more
Euro-sceptic
He
said
in
an
interview
on
Breakfast
with
Frost
on
BBC1
If
the
Conservative
Party
comes
out
with
a
very
clear
and
very
united
policy
on
Europe
which
I
emphasise
would
be
bound
to
be
more
Euro-sceptic
than
our
opponents
or
more
Euro-sceptic
than
in
the
rest
of
the
Continent
that
would
be
a
much
firmer
basis
on
which
to
go
forward
than
saying
we
will
leave
this
essential
matter
to
a
referendum
He

that

Mr

said
What

now
is
to
cool
the

down
We
have
to
put
our
party
back
together
The
Essen
summit
provided
much
needed
relief
for
Mr
Major
from
his
domestic
troubles
with
declarations
on
jobs
growth
and
competitiveness
that
could
easily
have
been
written
in
the
Treasury
and
agreement
from
Jacques
Delors
the
outgoing
president
of
the
European
Commission
that
enlargement
of
the
EU
would
mean
a
fundamental
rewriting
of
key
planks
such
as
the
Common
Agricultural
Policy
The
Conservative
right
welcomed
Mr
Major's
recognition
that
a
referendum
would
be
considered
and
his
warning
to
the
federalist
members
of
the
EU
that
monetary
union
was
becoming
more
and
more
unlikely
as
it
grew
larger
and
larger
In
years
there
could
be
members
of
the
EU
Now
plainly
it
is
a
fatuous
proposition
to
assume
that
in
any
timescale
like
that
you
are
going
to
have
a
single
currency
across
However
a
different
emphasis
came
Mr
Kenneth
Clarke
who
attended
the
end-of-summit
press
conference
with
Mr
Major
He
disclosed
that
M
Delors
had
presented
papers
to
the
summit
that
the
only
two
countries
who
would
be
within
the
Maastricht
single-currency
criteria
by
were
Germany
and
the
United
Kingdom
In
fact
the
United
Kingdom
rather
more
so
than
Germany
because
we
are
the
strongest
recovering
economies
in
Europe
We
are
recovering
at
the
moment
rather
better
than
the
Germans
But
he
added
Whatever
the
Maastricht
timetable
may
say
I
don't
believe
a
majority
of
the
member
states
is
likely
to
be
able
to
get
that
timetable
Douglas
Hurd
the
Foreign
Secretary
called
for
a
wider
debate
on
closer
ties
with
Europe
away
from
the
froth
of
Westminster
and
for
an
intelligent
debate
about
the
single
currency
The
choice
would
not
have
to
be
made
until
It
gives
us
time
to
think
it
through
A
group
of
Euro-sceptic

Delors
steps
back
from
presidency
JACQUES
DELORS
cast
the
French
left
into
gloom
last
night
by
declaring
that
he
would
not
run
for
the
presidency
despite
a
strong
lead
in
opinion
polls
Ending
weeks
of
indecision
the
outgoing
President
of
the
European
Commission
said
he
had
concluded
that
if
elected
he
would
be
unable
to
form
a
government
which
would
enable
him
to
put
his
reformist
ideas
into
action
I
would
have
the
feeling
that
I
had
lied
to
the
French
he
said
My
decision
is
irrevocable
One
cannot
play
with
the
nerves
of
the
French
people
His
calculation
was
based
on
the
high
chance
that
even
if
he
called
a
new
parliamentary
election
the
ruling
centre
and
right-wing
parties
would
win
again
Under
France's
hybrid
system
this
would
force
another
cohabitation
between
a
Socialist
president
and
Gaullist
prime
minister
M
Delors's
decision
removes
virtually
any
chance
of
another
Socialist
succeeding
President
Mitterrand
in
May
The
party
has
little
public
support
and
no
other
leader
of
presidential
calibre
Jacques
Chirac
the
Gaullist
leader
will
now
have
the
field
clear
to
try
to
catch
Edouard
Balladur
the
Prime
Minister
he
has
been
far
behind
M
Balladur
in
opinion
polls
Other
candidates
are
expected
to
join
the
race
and
the
decision
also
means
that
the
issue
of
Europe
will
probably
not
dominate
the
campaign
Mr
Delors's
decision
was
welcomed
privately
last
night
by
British
ministers
The
prospect
of
the
Commission
President
succeeding
M
Mitterrand
had
worried
Tory

Lone
Australian
gunman
seized
after

claims
lives
A
LONE
gunman
who
methodically
shot
and
killed
people
including
children
and
a
baby
in
the
Australian
tourist
resort
of
Port
Arthur
was
arrested
early
today
after
a
hour
siege
came
to
a
dramatic
end
The
year-old
Tasmanian
said
by
police
to
be
a
diagnosed
schizophrenic
with
a
history
of
mood
swings
set
fire
to
the
Seascape
guest
house
where
he
had
been
holding
three
people
hostage
There
was
no
immediate
news
early
today
of
the
fate
of
the
hostages
Two
of
those
being
held
by
the
gunmen
were
believed
to
be
David
and
Sally
Martin
the
elderly
owners
of
the
Seascape
guest
house
and
the
third
hostage
was
thought
to
be
a
guest
who
was
staying
there
Police
moved
in
by
helicopter
after
fire
engulfed
the
upper
floors
of
the
guest
house
The
gunman
was
being
treated
on
the
site
for
burns
Negotiations
with
the
gunman
broke
down
overnight
after
batteries
in
a
mobile
telephone
at
the
besieged
guesthouse
failed
Random
volleys
of
shots
were
heard
throughout
the
cold
night
as
more
than
Tasmanian
police
with
special
operations
reinforcements
from
other
states
sealed
off
the
area
Authorities
initially
put
the
death
toll
at
but
later
reduced
it
by
one
citing
confusion
in
the
aftermath
of
the
shootings
But
they
said
the
toll
could
still
rise
Another
people
are
being
treated
in
a
Hobart
hospital
for
gunshot
wounds
A
baby
several
children
two
Canadian
tourists
and
a
number
of
Asians
were
among
the
dead
Two
of
those
killed
were
Malaysian
one
was
Indian
with
the
origins
of
four
others
unknown
Police
said
they
had
been
flooded
with
calls
from
around
the
world
from
anxious
relatives
Another
two
Canadians
and
an
American
were
among
the
injured
No
names
had
been
released
by
last
night
According
to
witnesses
the
gunman
described
as
having
blond
hair
and
looking
like
a
surfie
or
surfer
drove
into
the
tourist
site
in
a
Volkswagen
with
a
surf
board
strapped
to
its
roof
He
wandered
up
to
the
Broadarrow
cafeteria
in
Port
Arthur
village
chatted
with
tourists
and
commented
There's
a
lot
of
Wasps
White
Anglo-Saxon
Protestants
around
today
there's
not
many
Japs
here
are
there
Witnesses
say
that
the
man
then
entered
the
cafeteria
produced
a
gun
and
began
firing
He
tried
setting
fire
to
the
building
and
then
wandered
about
the
historic
site
firing
He
shot
a
woman
and
her
daughters
aged
six
and
three
before
commandeering
a
car
and
killing
its
four
occupants
The
gunman
then
drove
around
shooting
at
cars
and
coaches
carrying
tourists
and
at
a
nearby
general
store
Minutes
later
he
abandoned
his
vehicle
and
entered
the
Fox
and
Hounds
hotel
which
was
crowded
at
the
time
After
shooting
he
took
some
hostages
and
ordered
them
into
the
nearby
Seascape
guest
house
The
entire
shooting
spree
is
thought
to
have
lasted
about
an
hour
According
to
some
reports
the
gunman
also
fired
at
rescue
helicopters
taking
the
injured
to
hospital
One
woman
in
the
cafeteria
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
said
she
hid
under
a
table
when
the
man
opened
fire
She
said
I
just
lay
there
and
all
l
could
hear
was
the
gun
and
screaming
The
only
thing
that
went
through
my
head
was
the
next
one's
for
me
She
said
that
after
the
shooting
had
ended
there
were
people
just
sitting
there
in
their
chairs
where
they'd
been
eating
dead
There
was
a
weird
sort
of
calm
as
if
no
one
could
believe
what
they
were
seeing
Sydney
tourist
Rob
Atkins
said
he
initially
mistook
the
gunfire
for
musket
shots
which
could
have
been
part
of
an
historic
pageant
It
was
really
weird
because
some
people
were
running
up
the
hill
hysterical
other
people
were
just
dawdling
around
looking
at
the
ruins
and
others
were
laughing
about
it
as
if
it
was
some
kind
of
joke
as
an
historic
site
it
was
quite
feasible
this
was
part
of
the
show
Mr
Atkins
said
Luppo
Prinz
Tasmania's
assistant
police
commissioner
said
that
the
gunman
comes
from
Hobart
and
that
members
of
his
family
were
helping
officers
with
the
negotiations
There
were
reports
that
the
man's
father
had
committed
suicide
but
his
mother
was
still
alive
Mr
Prinz
said
it
was
possible
a
personal
dispute
had
sparked
off
the
shooting
spree
and
that
the
limited
comments
the
gunman
has
so
far
made
to
police
have
made
little
sense
He
said
the
gunman
has
not
even
spoken
about
the
shootings
so
far
He's
not
saying
he
did
anything
More
than
police
from
the
small
island
state
surrounded
the
area
where
the
killings
took
place
and
shots
were
reported
from
inside
the
house
The
injured
were
being
treated
in
the
Royal
Hobart
Hospital
which
was
on
full
disaster
alert
and
almost
half
were
described
as
being
in
a
critical
or
serious
condition
Witnesses
said
that
at
first
they
thought
the
gunfire
was
part
of
the
lunchtime
show
at
the
former
penal
colony
which
was
built
miles
south-west
of
Hobart
in
But
when
the
first
volley
of
shots
were
fired
indiscriminately
into
the
crowded
streets
hundreds
of
visitors
ran
for
their
lives
Amateur
video
recordings
showed
tourists
shaking
in
shock
as
they
hid
from
the
gunman
as
he
began

Two
car
loads
of
people
came
in
two
were
shot
in
the
head
one
through
the
shoulder
and
one
through
the
arm
The
gunman
shot
up
several
packed
tourist
coaches
and
killed
at
least
one
driver
A
witness
Phillip
Milburn
told
reporters
He
wasn't
going
bang
bang
bang
bang
it
was
bang
and
then
he'd
pick
someone
else
out
and
line
them
up
and
shoot
them
Police
told
the
Reuter
news
agency
the
mock-Tudor
Fox
and
Hounds
Hotel
was
crowded
with
tourists
when
the
gunman
entered
and
began
shooting
wildly
That's
where
most
of
the
people
were
killed
a
spokesman
said
He
just
shot
everyone
who
was
coming
in
said
a
visitor
Karen
Jones
A
mother
was
saying
you
have
to
get
my
baby
to
hospital
quick
quick
but
it
was
already
dead
The
armed
man
then
took
refuge
in
the
Seascape
guest
house
with
the
hostages
He
continued
to
shoot
at
police
and
rescue
helicopters
Tasmania's
police
commissioner
John
Johnson
made
a
personal
plea
for
the
man
to
surrender
Why
he
has
done
this
no
one
knows
But
if
he's
done
it
to
make
some
point
in
life
he's
made
that
point
now's
the
time
to
come
out
and
avoid
any
more
bloodshed
Mr
Johnson
added
Various
massacres
would
pale
into
insignificance
when
you
look
at
what
has
happened
in
Tasmania
The
Australian
prime
minister
John
Howard
said
he
was
horrified
to
hear
of
the
shocking
and
senseless
act
and
extended
the
government's
sympathy
to
the
bereaved
The
Anglican
Bishop
of
Tasmania
the
Rt
Rev
Phillip
Newall
said
This
must
be
the
darkest
day
of
tragedy
in
the
history
of
this
state
We
all
remember
what
the
massacre
at
Dunblane
did
to
us
I
thought
that
just
couldn't
happen
here
The
Queen
sent
a
message
of
sympathy
to
Tasmania
saying
that
she
was
deeply
shocked
by
the
tragedy
The
Prime
Minister
John
Major
said
in
a
message
to
Mr
Howard
With
the
dreadful
events
at
the
school
in
Dunblane
still
fresh
in
our
minds
here
I
know
only
too
well
the
horror
people
in
Australia
must
be
feeling
Words
are
not
adequate
to
cope
with
the
emotions
such
senseless
killings
arouse
A
spokesman
for
Stirling
council
said
that
the
people
of
Dunblane
will
also
be
sending
a
message
of
sympathy
He
said
s=0.94
w=31
They
will
also
be
expressing
the
hope
that
people
will
rally
round
as
they
did
in
Dunblane
and
that
they
receive
as
much
help
and
support
as
they
did
in
Dunblane
The
killings
sent
shock
waves
throughout
Australia
with
questions
being
raised
over
the
country's
gun
laws
The
Coalition
on
Gun
Control
said
the
federal
government
must
move
quickly
to
establish
national
gun
registration
laws
and
ban
the
private
ownership
of
semiautomatic
weapons
Federal
and
state
police
ministers
tried
to
draft
such
legislation
late
last
year
but
could
not
agree
on
the
details
Australia's
federal
attorney
general
Darryl
Williams
said
it
was
time
for
the
states
who
have
the
constitutional
responsibilities
for
gun
control
to
put
aside
their
differences
State
guns
laws
vary
in
Australia
but
it
is
fairly
relatively
easy
for
a
person
without
a
criminal
record
to
buy
a
rifle
or
shotgun
Pistols
are
less
commonly
owned
In
Sydney
Simon
Chapman
of

on
Gun
Control
said

The

in

the
bus
was
pulling
away
from

in
Bhai
Pheru
miles
southwest
of

provincial
capital
Lahore
Witnesses
said
it
ignited
the
fuel
tank
transforming
the
vehicle
into
an
inferno
that
trapped
screaming
passengers
inside
Onlookers
watched
helplessly
as
the
bus
was
consumed
by
flames
They
said
most
of
its
doors
and
windows
were
closed
and
there
were
no
fire
extinguishers
The
blaze
spread
so
fast
that
two
children
sitting
on
the
dashboard
by
an
open
window
died
The
driver
escaped
through
the
window
but
was
badly
burned
Most
of
the
dead
were
charred
beyond
recognition
Their
ashes
were
collected
and
placed
in
a
single
coffin
which
was
buried
at
Bhai
Pheru's
cemetery
after
a
mass
funeral
Police
said
the
death
toll
could
rise
to
as
many
of
the
injured
suffered
severe
burns

Killer
captured
after
rampage
in
Australian
tourist
town
Police
today
captured
the
gunman
who
killed
at
least
people
in
a
rampage
of
indiscriminate
slaughter
in
Tasmania
The
year-old
man
was
seized
after
he
held
three
hostages
in
a
cottage
overnight
and
then
set
the
building
alight
Armed
police
had
surrounded
the
guest
house
where
he
had
taken
refuge
after
his
killing
spree
at
the
small
tourist
town
of
Port
Arthur
At
least
people
were
injured
some
seriously
A
police
spokesman
said
they
captured
the
man
who
had
suffered
burns
outside
the
cottage
They
were
proceeding
to
search
the
building
to
learn
what
happened
to
the
hostages
The
gunman
who
has
a
history
of
mental
problems
had
been
firing
on
police
with
heavy-calibre
military-type
rifles
one
of
them
an
AR-15
and
the
other
an
SKS
assault
rifle
Deputy
Police
Commissioner
Richard
McCreadie
said
Earlier
yesterday
the
man
had
driven
into
town
in
a
Volkswagen
with
a
surfboard
on
the
roof
and
chatted
idly
with
tourists
at
the
site
of
the
historic
penal
colony
around
which
the
town
is
built
Then
he
pulled
out
a
rifle
which
was
concealed
in
a
tennis-racket
cover
entered
the
Broad
Arrow
Caf
and
began
firing
chasing
the
tourists
as
they
ran
screaming
into
the
street
He
moved
on
to
the
car
park
where
he
turned
on
two
coaches
killing
several
tourists
in
each
one
and
fired
on
cars
which
were
approaching
the
gates
to
the
site
He
left
the
site
shooting
as
he
went
shooting
everybody
he
could
see
said
Wendy
Scurr
who
was
working
at
the
front
desk
The
gunman
then
drove
to
the
nearby
Fox
and
Hounds
Hotel
crowded
with
tourists
where
he
continued
shooting
That's
where
most
of
the
people
were
killed
a
police
spokesman
said
Thirty
Australians
and
two
Canadian
tourists
died
including
several
children
and
a
baby
He
wasn't
going
bang
bang
bang
it
was
bang
and
then
he'd
pick
someone
else
out
and
line
them
up
and
shoot
them
said
a
witness
Phillip
Milburn
Police
were
releasing
little
information
about
the
man
from
Hobart
He
has
been
undertaking
medical
treatment
for
some
problems
that
he
has
had
said
Luppo
Prinz
Tasmania's
Assistant
Police
Commissioner
Members
of
his
family
helped
police
with
their
negotiations
during
the
siege
It
was
possible
a
personal
dispute
sparked
off
the
shooting
spree
Police
still
searching
around
the
ruins
of
the
old
penal
convict
settlement
for
more
bodies
said
the
death-toll
could
be
higher
Television
reports
said
the
gunman
also
shot
at
helicopters
ferrying
the
wounded
to
hospital
in
Hobart
and
there
were
reports
that
a
parked
car
with
people
in
it
was
set
alight
It
is
only
a
month
since
children
and
their
teacher
were
shot
in
Dunblane
nine
years
before
Michael
Ryan
killed
people
in
Hungerford
But
the
toll
in
Port
Arthur
seems
likely
to
be
the
highest
yet
in
such
an
incident
The
assault
left
Australia
stunned
I
was
shocked
and
appalled
at
the
senseless
murder
of
innocent
people
and
offer
the
government's
sympathies
to
the
families
and
friends
of
those
who
have
died
and
been
injured
the
Prime

John

said
State
laws
vary
in
Australia
but
it
is
fairly
easy
for
a
person
without
a
criminal
record
to
buy
a
rifle
or
shotgun
Previous
incidents
have
made
gun

to
lead

Jet
in

alert
as
it
drops
chute
An
inquiry
was
launched
last
night
after
a
safety
chute
fell
off
a
Virgin
Atlantic
Jumbo
jet
and
landed
in
a
car
park
The
Boeing
had
just
completed
a
maintenance
check
conducted
by
British

engineers
and
was
on
its
way
to
Kennedy
Airport
New

from

A
few
minutes
after
take-off
the
chute
broke
free
of
its
housing
on
the
wing
and
fell
into
the
park
at
Foyle
in
Slough
Berkshire
It
was
only
after
a
lorry
driver
who
had
been
in
the
car
park
reported
the
incident
that
the
aircrew
were
alerted
and
the
captain
decided
to
return
to
London
for
safety
checks
A
Virgin
spokeswoman
said
There
was
no
question
of
danger
to
passengers
or
crew
and
losing
the
chute
did
not
affect
the
integrity
of
the
aircraft
A
full
inquiry
has
been
launched
into
the
incident
she
added
The
chute
is
deployed
in
the
event
of
an
emergency
landing
when
it
would
inflate
like
a
giant
slide
to
help
passengers
make
a
quick
exit
from

Lone
killer's
carnage
in
quiet
tourist
town
stuns
whole
nation
The
most
violent
day
in
Tasmania's
history
since
colonial
times
began
without
warning
just
after
pm
yesterday
Like
most
Sundays
it
was
the
busiest
day
of
the
week
at
Port
Arthur
which
was
once
a
penal
settlement
and
is
now
the
island's
leading
tourist
attraction
There
was
nothing
immediately
remarkable
about
the
young
man
who
arrived
in
a
Volkswagen
with
a
surf
board
tied
to
the
roof
Witnesses
said
he
had
blond
hair
and
a
surfy
appearance
But
the
tennis-racket
case
he
was
carrying
concealed
a
rifle
and
soon
the
area
was
to
become
a
slaughterhouse
as
he
turned
the
gun
on
all
those
around
him
The
bloodshed
began
when
he
walked
into
a
restaurant
near
the
ruins
of
the
th-century
prison
and
started
firing
at
local
people
working
there
Then
he
walked
to
the
car
park
and
its
toll
gates
firing
at
tourists
arriving
in
buses
and
cars
From
there
he
went
to
the
nearby
Fox
and
Hounds
Hotel
where
he
shot
more
people
He
then
took
three
people
hostage
and
fled
to
a
tourist
lodge
three
miles
away
After
a
hour
siege
he
was
arrested
The
fate
of
the
hostages
was
not
known
last
night
The
number
of
people
shot
dead
was
initially
put
at
but
it
is
thought
the
final
toll
could
be
higher
A
witness
who
saw
the
start
of
the
massacre
said
He
said
There
are
a
lot
of
WASPs
White
Anglo-Saxon
Protestants
around
today
There
aren't
many
Japs
are
there
Then
he
started
muttering
to
himself
walked
inside
and
started
firing
Karen
Jones
a
visitor
from
Hobart
the
Tasmanian
capital
said
He
went
to
the
toll
gates
and
shot
at
everyone
who
was
coming
in
Phillip
Millburn
from
Hobart
said
He
would
line
people
up
before
shooting
them
It
was
something
smaller
than
a
rifle
and
it
was
meant
to
kill
Sue
Hobbs
an
employee
at
the
Port
Arthur
Tourist
Centre
said
It's
shocked
us
Many
of
the
people
employed
here
have
come
in
to
help
even
if
they
were
rostered
off
It's
a
quiet
community
You
can
imagine
how
this
has
rocked
everyone
Our
staff
are
remaining
very
calm
It's
unbelievable
to
see
how
people
have
put
their
own
fears

concerns
aside
to

general
public
The

Phillip
Newell

Anglican
Bishop
of
Tasmania
said
The
police
the
chaplains
the
doctors

have
given

is
expressing
its
grief
and

the

of
the
deepest
shadow
John
Johnson
Tasmania's
Police
Commissioner
said
I
don't
know
why
he's

this
More
than
police
converged
on
Port
Arthur
and
set
up
roadblocks
around
the
town
and
the
Seascape
Guest
House
where
the
gunman
went
to
ground
with
his
hostages
Emergency
services
were
stretched
to
the
limit
as
every
available
helicopter
flew
in
to
shuttle
the
injured
to
hospital
in
Hobart
where
beds
were
vacated
for
all

critical

John

This
is
something
beyond

Tasmania

normally
one
of
Australia's
most
peaceful
places
where
people
flock
to
escape
the
stresses
of
city
life
in
mainland
Australia
and
to
find
solace
in
the
wilderness
Its
colonial
history
however
was
far
from
peaceful
Port
Arthur
on
the
southern
end
of
the
Tasman
Peninsula
is
the
site
of
one
of
Britain's
most
infamous
penal
institutions
which
operated
from

The
township
was
the
centre
of
a
vast
penal
network
More
than
convicts
passed
through
its
gates
Just
offshore
is
the
Isle
of
the
Dead
named
for
many
of
those
who
died
in
chains
The
tourists
caught
in
yesterday's
massacre
were
among
thousands
each
year
who
visit
the
Port
Arthur
ruins
considered
the
most
graphic
surviving
monument
of
Australia's
convict
era
Last
night
in
the
wake
of
the
killings
there
were
more
calls
for
tighter
nationwide
gun
laws
Other
than
the
island's
th-century
colonial
massacres
of
Aborigines
yesterday's
tragedy
was
easily
Australia's
worst
mass
killing
of
recent
times
In
August
a
year-old
former
army
cadet
shot
seven
people
dead
and
injured
while
firing
at
motorists
in
Hoddle
Street
Melbourne
Four
months
later
a
year-old
law
student
shot
eight
workers
dead
in
a
Melbourne
office
building
then
jumped
to
his
death
In
August
a
year-old
taxi-driver
armed
with
an
assault
rifle
killed
seven
shoppers
in
a
Sydney
shopping
mall
then
shot
himself
dead
Australians
were
horrified
by
yesterday's
massacre
and
its
scale
Many
had
been
lulled
into
a
belief
that
such
a
massacre
could
not
happen
again
after
demands
for
tighter
gun
laws
in
the
wake
of
the
three
earlier
incidents
But
apart
from
small
changes
the
federal
and
state
governments
have
spent
much
of
the
time
since
then
wrangling
over
details
The
most
recent
talks
between
federal
and
state
ministers
ended
inconclusively
last
November
Simon
Chapman
of
the
Australian
Coalition
for
Gun
Control
said
the
laws
should
ban
private
ownership
of
semi-automatic
rifles
and
impose
tougher
guidelines
on
who
could
own
firearms
He
said
state
governments
in
Tasmania
New
South
Wales
and
Queensland
were
cowering
in
political
fear
of

Baby
saved
from
death
in

ditch
A
tearful
father
yesterday
told
how
he
pulled
his
month-old
son
from
a
water-filled
ditch
and
helped
bring
him
back
to

after

Sean
McNulty
from
Silsden
West
Yorkshire
said
he
thought
his
youngest
son
Joshua
was
dead
after
a
crash
near
Great
Yarmouth
Norfolk
early
on
Saturday
He
wept
as
he
described
how
the
youngster
spluttered
back
to
life
following
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation
and
heart
massage
on
the
roadside
for
what
seemed
like
hours
Mr
McNulty
and
his
family
were
travelling
home
when
their
car
left
the
road
and
plunged
into
a
ditch
He
said
he
could
see
that
his
wife
and
two
other
sons
Daniel
seven
and
Andrew
five
had
scrambled
to
safely
But
he
was
unable
to
find
Joshua
who
had
been
sitting
in
a
child
seat
in
the
back
In
desperation
he
waded
in
the
ditch
calling
his
son's
name
He
then
heard
a
passing
motorist
Samantha
Lee
from
Lakenham
Norwich
yell
that
the
child
was
face
down
in
the
water
behind
him
I
could
just
see
his
cardigan
and
I
pulled
at
it
and
there
he
was
and
I
lifted
him
onto
the
side
Mr
McNulty
explained
I
don't
know
what
death
looks
like
but
he
looked
like
he
had
gone
He
looked
like
my
Grandma
when
she
died
all
pale
and
blue
Mr
McNulty
a
trained
first-aider
gave
the
child
heart
massage
while
another
passing
motorist
Alex
Hardy
gave
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation
Eventually
the
child
coughed
and
cried
out
He
coughed
and
all
this
stuff
came
out
of
his
mouth
and
he
started
crying
and
I
knew
then
that
he
was
all
right
and
then
I
just
fainted
said
Mr
McNulty
He
was
overcome
when
asked
Mr
McNulty
simply
turned
to
look
at
his
son
and
said
How
would
anyone
feel
Mrs
McNulty
said

husband
was

He
was

SCIENTISTS
at
the
unit
monitoring
the
newly

strain
of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease
believe
three
more
people
may

doctors
yesterday

cast
doubt
over
the
case
of
a
year-old
girl
said
to
be
suffering
from
the
illness
The
CJD
surveillance
unit
at
Edinburgh
has
privately
indicated
that
the
three
cases
all
women
aged
between
and
have
been
discovered
since

They
fear
the
new
strain
of
CJD
which
appears
to
be
linked
to
BSE
found
in
cattle
may
have
claimed
up
to
nine
victims
including
the
girl
and
the
three
women
whom
they
refused
to
identify
in
the
past
few

The
others
comprise
Graham
Brown
and
Barry
Baker
both
from
the
Ashford
area
in
Kent
whose
illnesses
were
announced
last
Thursday
two
women
aged
between
and
whose
symptoms
developed
last

February
and
a
man
aged
from
Scotland
who
was
diagnosed
a

symptoms
memory
loss
hallucinations
and

These
characterised
some
of
the

brought
about
the
collapse
of
the
beef
industry
when
details
of
a
possible
link
between
BSE
and
CJD
were
announced
to
Parliament
last
month
Details
of
the
new
cases
emerged
as
senior
medical
staff
at
Glasgow's
Southern
General
Hospital
where
the
unnamed
year-old
girl
is
being
treated
raised
doubts
about
the
accuracy
of
the
American-developed
test
used
in
her
diagnosis
Colleagues
of
her
consultant
Professor
Peter
Behan
believe
a
definite
diagnosis
can
only
be
made
through
a
post-mortem
examination
A
hospital
spokesman
confirmed
that
the
CJD
diagnosis
was
not
the
judgment
of
senior
clinicians
until
it
could
be
confirmed
by
subsequent
tests
A
quarter
of
junior
doctors
have
given
up
eating
British
beef
because
of
concern
about
a
link
between
BSE
and
the
new
strain
of
CJD

Free
but
the
nightmare
won't
go
I
went
for
a
walk
and
a
haircut
After
months
in
prison
it
was
terrifying
I
was
even
frightened
by
the
traffic
THEY
checked
into
a
discreet
hotel
under
the
names
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Francis
For
Cheryl
Tooze
and
boyfriend
Jonathan
Jones
who
was
cleared
by
the
Court
of
Appeal
last
week
of
the
murder
of
her
parents
the
aliases
were
part
of
an
attempt
to
take
refuge
from
the
prying
cameras
and
waving
chequebooks
his
release
has
attracted
It
has
been
a
circus
I
have
found
it
absolutely
bewildering
said
Jonathan
as
he
relaxed
with
Cheryl
in
their
hotel
bedroom
The
couple
have
turned
down
lucrative
offers
from
the
tabloids
but
were
happy
to
speak
to
journalists
Cheryl
has
come
to
know
Since
Jonathan's
conviction
each
has
been
through
their
own
kind
of
hell
Cheryl
has
changed
from
a
shy
unworldly
woman
to
a
determined
campaigner
She
has
lost
a
stone
developed
an
ulcer
and
her
nerves
are
held
together
by
anti-depressants
Jonathan
has
lost
several
stone
Pale
and
bowed
he
seems
almost
to
have
sleepwalked
through
the
past
few
days
Yesterday
I
went
for
a
walk
in
the
West
End
and
got
a
haircut
After
months
in
prison
it
was
terrifying
l
was
even
frightened
by
the
noise
of
the
traffic
he
said
There
is
no
way
that
Jonathan
and
Cheryl
can
yet
put
the
events
that
occurred
on
the
July
at
the
small
farmhouse
in
Llanharry
Mid
Glamorgan
behind
them
Conversation
inevitably
comes
back
to
it
it
fills
their
dreams
and
their
waking
hours
Cheryl's
father
Harry
Tooze
a
retired
fruit
farmer
and
his
wife
Megan
were
killed
by
a
bore
shotgun
which
blasted
off
the
backs
of
their
heads
The
attack
had
the
hallmarks
of
a
professional
execution
From
the
start
Jonathan
and
Cheryl
who
was
dissuaded
by
South
Wales
Police
from
offering
a
reward
for
information
co-operated
fully
with
the
authorities
They
now
feel
that
they
were
naive
that
Jonathan
was
targeted
as
the
killer
very
early
on
When
police
called
at
their
Kent
flat
to
arrest
Jonathan
on
December
neither
Cheryl
nor
Jonathan
could
believe
it
I
was
incredibly
naive
I
had
this
faith
in
the
fairness
of
the
police
I
thought
it
was
all
a
mistake
Jonathan
recalled
The
terrible
thing
is
that
he
was
so
innocent
said
Cheryl
The
couple's
friends
find
it
hard
to
understand
why
Jonathan
was
singled
out
by
police
The
son
of
a
surveyor
he
worked
in
market
research
and
had
no
history
of
trouble
with
the
law
He
is
gentle
and
thoughtful
given
to
almost
academic
reflectiveness
Even
now
after
a
period
in
jail
he
was
particularly
unequipped
to
deal
with
the
clang
of
cell
doors
the
smell
of
urine
the
fights
and
violence
Jonathan
is
measured
when
he
speaks
of
the
judicial
process
It
has
become
received
wisdom
that
per
cent
of
murders
are
committed
by
relatives
and
that
per
cent
are
committed
by
male
relatives
under
the
age
of
he
said
That
was
the
reason
the
police
concentrated
on
me
I
was
simply
the
nearest
male
relative
I
can
understand
the
police
had
a
duty
to
investigate
me
but
it
was
absolutely
wrong
that
the
police
seemed
to
concentrate
on
me
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
suspects
Defence
solicitors
Layla
Attfield
and
Stuart
Hutton
who
donated
their
services
free
for
much
of
the
case
so
convinced
were
they
of
Jonathan's
innocence
recently
found
that
South
Wales
police
had
continued
to
investigate
him
after
his
conviction
The
one
piece
of
forensic
evidence
linking
Jonathan
with
the
murder
the
smudged
top
of
his
thumbprint
on
the
saucer
of
the
best
tea
set
Harry
and
Megan
Tooze
produced
for
the
visitor
who
presumably
killed
them
was
only
discovered
five
months
after
the
murder
Police
left
Jonathan
alone
in
the
room
containing
the
cup
and
saucer
for
minutes
after
he
drove
to
Wales
on
Cheryl's
urging
on
the
night
of
the
murder
to
find
out
what
had
happened
There
was
not
a
drop
of
blood
on
his
clothes
whereas
the
killer
might
have
been
expected
to
be
spattered
with
blood
But
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
that
in
the
months
before
the
murder
Harry
Tooze
was
scared
of
something
His
wife
told
Cheryl
he
was
sleeping
with
a
loaded
Luger
under
his
bed
I
have
lost
all
my
illusions
about
the
judicial
system
If
it
were
not
for
my
parent's
support
and
Cheryl's
support
and
the
support
of
an
exceptional
team
of
solicitors
I
would
still
be
in
Gartree
prison
Jonathan
said
I
would
like
to
do
what
I
can
to
stop
someone
else
being
convicted
like
I
was
on
the
basis
of
gossip
and
suspicion
Jonathan
says
he
will
only
feel
truly
vindicated
when
the
killer
is
caught
But
South
Wales
police
have
no
plans
to
reopen
the
inquiry
One
wonders
what
the
South
Wales
police
have
got
to
hide
says
Jonathan
What
is
another
police
officer
going
to
make
of
the
evidence
Cheryl
added
The
fact
they
are
not
going
to
reopen
the
investigation
is
an
insult
to
my
parents
memory
I
am
never
going
to
get
it
out
of
my
mind
Jon
standing
handcuffed
in
the
dock
was
like
somone
sticking
a
knife
in
me
I
had
to
cope
When
you're
hit
and
hit
and
hit
and
you
take
so
many
knocks
you
build
a
barrier
around
yourself
As
yet
the
couple
have
no
plans
for
the
future
they
don't
even
know
where
they
are
going
to
live
or
how
they
are
going
to
survive
Perhaps
says
Cheryl
they
will
write
a
book
They
obsessively
retell
the
case
with
all
the
legal
minutiae
at
their
fingertips
They
have
not
ruled
out
going
back
to
South
Wales
even
though
many
people
there
including
Cheryl's
estranged
aunts
and
uncles
regard
them
with
suspicion
I
know
the
whole
campaign
against
us
is
not
important
but
it
bugs
me
I
want
to
get
on
with
living
our
lives
and
stop
the
whispering
said
Cheryl
Jonathan
shrugs
If
anybody
has
anything
to
say
I
want
them
to
say
it
to
my
face
The
fact
that
they
are
different
Jonathan
speaks
with
a
clipped
English
accent
and
they
have
been
together
years
but
never
married
helped
to
fuel
the
atmosphere
of
suspicion
Jonathan's
mother
Pauline
said
I
want
them
to
get
married
But
they're
of
a
different
generation
that
sort
of
thing
has
never
been
important
to
them
Cheryl
is
an
emotional
woman
During
the
appeal
her
fears
was
rarely
far
from
the
surface
She
sat
gripping
the
edge
of
the
bench
as
Jonathan's
father
Graham
who
has
aged
painfully
through
the
past
year
sat
with
his
hand
on
her
arm
But
Jonathan
says
her
greatest
quality
is
her
strength
Whatever
happens
I
will
never
ever
give
up
Cheryl
said
during
the
appeal
Jonathan
has
his
emotions
more
under
control
Except
for
the
first
bleak
days
after
his
imprisonment
when
he
considered
suicide
as
a
way
of
freeing
his
girlfriend
he
has
adopted
a
forensic
approach
pulling
the
strands
of
the
trial
apart
In
prison
Jonathan
did
make
friends
but
he
had
to
cultivate
a
wariness
that
was
quite
new
to
him
The
publicity
the
case
attracted
made
him
a
target
for
false
confessions
on
five
occasions
inmates
claimed
that
he
had
confessed
that
he
was
guilty
His
solicitors
had
to
move
him
to
his
own
cell
to
protect
him
from
fellow
prisoners
who
would
hope
to
gain
favour
by
this
tactic
Now
the
couple
are
having
to
relearn
each
other's
characters
Jonathan
has
told
me
loads
of
things
about
prison
said
Cheryl
He
has
been
learning
how
I've
changed
Cheryl
has
been
bossing
me
something
rotten
Jonathan
grumbles
Both
of
us
are
anxious
to
get
on
with
our
lives
but
our
lives
have
become
so
bound
up
with
the
case
I
don't
think
we're
quite
sure
how
to
go
on
Although
there
is
no
sign
that
they
plan
to
conform
to
South
Wales
morality
by
getting
married
Cheryl
says
that
for
the
first
time
she
has
begun
to
think
of
a
family
I
want
children
Having
lost
my
own
parents
so
horribly
has
made
me
think
very
much
of
the
importance
of
bringing
my
own
children
into
the
world

Boots
suppressed
its
own
survey
on
cheaper
drugs
BOOTS
one
of
Britain's
most
trusted
companies
commissioned
research
and
then
suppressed
it
after
the
results
showed
that
its
most
lucrative
drug
could
be
replaced
by
products
three
times
as
cheap
and
just
as
effective
The
episode
revealed
this
weekend
has
reinforced
fears
that
corporate
sponsorship
compromises
medical
research
when
it
threatens
profits
Boots
commissioned
the
study
when
rival
companies
claimed
their
cheaper
products
worked
as
well
as
Synthroid
the
drug
of
choice
for
American
doctors
treating
hypothyroidism
and
taken
by
about
eight
million
people
every
day
The
use
of
cheaper
options
could
wipe
million
m
a
year
off
US
health-care
costs
Boots
paid
for
the
survey
by
the
University
of
California
at
San
Francisco
When
Boots
threatened
legal
action
to
enforce
its
contractual
right
to
prevent
publication
the
university
refused
to
indemnify
Dr
Betty
Dong
and
her
team
fearing
significant
damages
Three
months
after
the
article
had
been
pulled
from
the
prestigious
Journal
of
the
American
Medical
Association
Synthroid
passed
to
the
German
chemical
giant
BASF
when
it
bought
the
Boots
drug
division
for
billion
The
existence
of
the
research
was
disclosed
to
BASF
Hypothyroidism
is
a
metabolic
disorder
with
symptoms
of
lethargy
stiffness
and
low
tolerance
of
cold
Synthroid
a
thyroid
hormone
is
unpatented
but
protected
by
the
bio-equivalence
barrier
An
absence
of
benchmark
data
clinical
trials
were
waived
for
Synthroid
when
it
was
introuced
in
means
that
without
new
research
no
other
drug
could
be
proved
to
work
in
exactly
the
same
way
Dr
Dong
a
clinical
pharmacist
had
her
finding
that
Synthroid
and
three
other
drugs
acted
in
the
same
way
accepted
for
publication
by
the
journal
after
peer-group
review
The
article
had
reached
page-proof
stage
for
inclusion
in
the
issue
of
January
when
Boots
threatened
to
enforce
its
contractual
right
to
withdraw
the
piece
Carter
Eckert
who
commissioned
the
research
when
she
was
a
Boots
executive
said
I
did
what
I
had
to
do
I
stopped
a
flawed
study
that
would
have
put
millions
of
patients
at
risk
But
Leslie
Bennet
chairman
of
the
university's
bio-pharmaceutical
sciences
department
said
flatly
The
Boots
people
did
everything
they
could
to
make
sure
this
study
didn't
get
published
because
it
was
detrimental
to
their
company
The
Wall
Street
Journal
reported
last
week
that
Boots
aggressively
strove
to
discredit
the
research
and
hired
a
team
of
private
investigators
to
help
it
do
so
The
suppression
of
the
research
is
an
example
of
a
growing
trend
that
is
difficult
to
prove
but
which
worries
academics
and
scientists
Richard
Smith
editor
of
the
British
Medical
Journal
said
Some
companies
take
the
view
that
they
own
scientific
data
because
it
was
produced
by
a
study
they
funded
It
is
difficult
to
know
how
widespread
the
problem
is
but
it
can
have
a
serious
biasing
effect
on
the
scientific
literature
It
is
worrying
The
only
comforting
note
was
struck
ironically
by
Dr
Andrew
Herxheimer
a
clinical
pharmacologist
who
has
studied
drug
companies
support
of
clinical
research
This
problem
has
always
been
with
us
he
said
It
cannot
get
any
worse
So
in
that
sense
things
can
only
get
better
Dr
Dong
suffered
the
final
indignity
last
summer
of
seeing
a
page
critique
of
her
findings
published
in
the
American
Journal
of
Therapeutics
One
of
its
editors
is
Dr
Gilbert
Mayor

led
the

to

Mad
killer
sets
besieged
guest
house
on
fire
after
die
in
Tasmania
A
GUNMAN
who
massacred
people
at
a
Tasmanian
tourist
centre
yesterday
was
captured
by
police
early
today
after
he
set
fire
to
a
seaside
guesthouse
where
he
had
held
three
hostages
for
hours
There
was
no
immediate
word
on
the
fate
of
the
hostages
Witnesses
said
a
helicopter
had
landed
near
the
Seascape
guesthouse
and
an
ambulance
was
heading
towards
it
The
hostages
were
thought
to
be
the
guesthouse
owners
David
and
Sally
Martin
both
in
their
s
and
a
male
driver
seized
earlier
One
officer
at
the
scene
Supt
Bob
Fielding
said
that
the
gunman
was
suffering
from
burns
He
had
been
shooting
at
a
cordon
of
police
with
heavy
calibre
military-type
rifles
one
of
them
an
AR-15
and
the
other
an
SKS
assault
rifle
At
one
point
during
negotiations
in
which
his
parents
helped
police
he
demanded
a
helicopter
to
make
his
escape
The
year-old
gunman
who
has
a
history
of
mental
illness
had
earlier
gone
on
a
murderous
walkabout
with
a
high-powered
rifle
at
the
packed
tourist
centre
a
former
penal
settlement
at
Port
Arthur
about
miles
from
the
island
capital
Hobart
His
victims
included
a
baby
and
several
other
children
At
least
other
people
were
wounded
four
of
them
critically
The
man
described
by
witnesses
as
a
ft
in
blond
surfie
type
with
a
beard
then
hijacked
a
car
and
carried
on
killing
about
two
miles
down
the
road
Two
of
the
victims
were
Canadian
two
Tasmanian
and
came
from
mainland
Australia
police
said
As
dawn
broke
a
search
resumed
for
other
people
who
might
have
been
killed
or
wounded
The
gunman
comes
from
the
Newport
area
of
Hobart
Police
would
not
immediately
name
him
The
killings
were
connected
with
a
domestic
situation
they
said
The
man
had
planned
the
murders
and
probably
knew
one
or
two
of
the
victims
But
one
witness
said
that
as
the
gunman
walked
past
he
was
muttering
to
himself
There's
a
lot
of
wasps
around
today
not
many
Japs
here
are
there
By
wasps
he
is
assumed
to
have
been
using
the
acronym
for
White
Anglo-Saxon
Protestants
About
tourists
were
in
the
settlement
the
busiest
day
of
the
week
when
the
killer
drove
up
at
about
pm
in
a
stolen
yellow
Volkswagen
with
a
surfboard
on
top
People
saw
him
take
a
tennis
bag
from
the
car
and
pull
out
a
high-powered
rifle
The
carnage
began
at
about
pm
when
he
walked
into
the
Broad
Arrow
cafe
and
took
aim
at
people
sitting
at
tables
or
standing
at
the
counter
He
continued
his
massacre
outside
Phillip
Kelly
the
cafe
owner
said
There
were
people
lying
dead
or
dying
all
over
the
cafeteria
floor
and
in
the
grounds
Karen
Jones
of
Hobart
said
He
wasn't
shooting
indiscriminately
he
was
taking
aim
He
had
a
big
rifle
with
great
big
bullets
really
big
bullets
It
was
a
gun
meant
to
kill
people
The
man
shot
at
several
buses
in
the
car
park
of
the
site
Then
he
encountered
a
woman
and
three
children
in
their
car
near
the
toll
gates
She
pleaded
with

He
added
that
two
of

killed
at
the
cafe
were
staff
including
a
year-old

Another
witness
Rob
Atkins
who
captured
some
of
the
horrifying
scenes
on
his
video
camera
said
that
people
were
running
hysterically
from
the
shooting
In
a
surreal
touch
other
people
were
laughing
about
it
as
if
it
was
some
sort
of
joke
thinking
that
it
was
part
of
the
tourist
show
As
the
killer
continued
on
his
rampage
he
shot
and
killed
the
driver
of
a
bus
and
three
tourists
on
board
He
then
walked
yards
to
a
general
store
shooting
dead
a
woman
in
her
car
outside
He
took
her
husband
hostage
and
forced
him
to
drive
along
the
Arthur
highway
past
the
Fox
and
Hounds
hotel

yards
past
the
hotel
he
started
firing

several

then
went
to

small
pink
weatherboard
Seascape
hotel
where
he
fired
at
guests
and
took
the
three
hostages
Supt
Barry
Bennett
said
when
the
siege
began
He
is
in
a
very
good
position
to
defend
himself
with
the
harbour
on
one
side
and
fields
and

behind
After

injured

were
ferried
by

across
Storm
Bay
to
the
Hobart
cenotaph
on
a
headland
overlooking
the

where

Kiss

baby
drowned

A
BABY
boy
was
revived
by
the
kiss
of
life
after
being
pulled
from
a
water-filled
ditch
into
which
he
had
been
catapulted
when
a
family
car
ran
off
the
road
Ten-month-old
Joshua
McNulty
was
not
breathing
when
he
was
plucked
from
the
three-foot
deep
water
by
his
father
Sean
Alex
Hardy
a
passenger
in
the
vehicle
which
had
collided
with
Mr
McNulty's
car
resuscitated
him
on
the
bank
Mr
McNulty
who
is
trained
in
first-aid
helped
bring
his
son
round
by
massaging
his
heart
Yesterday
Joshua
and
his
parents
were
recovering
in
hospital
The
accident
at
Acle
near
Great
Yarmouth
Norfolk
happened
when
Mr
McNulty
a
landscape
gardener
from
Silsden
West
Yorks
was
returning
from
a
seaside
break
at
Caister
with
his

Anne

Daniel
seven

Andrew
six
Their
Ford
Escort
swerved
into
the
ditch
coming
to
rest
on
its
side
Mr
McNulty
who
was
driving
struggled
out
and
found
Joshua
was
missing
The
baby
had
been
sitting
in
a
child
seat
in
the
back
and
was
catapulted
into
the
water
feet
away
Yesterday
Mr
McNulty
described
how
he
escaped
by
kicking
out
the
sun
roof
and
helped
other
members
of
his
family
out
before
realising
Joshua
was
missing
He
said
I
thought
at
first
that
he
must
be
under
the
car
seat
but
he
was
not
there
Then
I
got
into
the
water
which
was
waist-deep
but
there
was
still
no
sign
of
him
Our
luggage
had
spilled
everywhere
and
I
kept
on
picking
up
items
of
clothing
thinking
it
was
a
baby
Other
motorists
who
had
stopped
to
help
watched
as
Mr
McNulty
searched
His
wife
on
the
bank
screamed
My
baby
is
dead
Then
one
helper
Tanya
Fletcher
He's
behind
you
The
father
said
I
could
just
see
his
cardigan
and
I
pulled
at
it
and
there
he
was
I
lifted
him
on
to
the
side
His
face
was
pale
and
his
lips
were
going
blue
Mr
McNulty
added
Joshua
had
stopped
breathing
This
other
man
grabbed
hold
of
him
and
stuck
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
to
get
the
water
out
There
was
no
response
so
I
started
slapping
him
on
his
back
I
kept
shouting
that
I
was
not
going
to
let
him
die
on
me
I
turned
him
over
on
his
side
and
the
stranger
gave
him
mouth-to-mouth
while
I
did
chest
compressions
Then
suddenly
he
just
sparked
into
life
He
coughed
and
all
this
stuff
came
out
of
his
mouth
When
he
started
crying
I
knew
he
was
all
right
but
then
I
just
collapsed
Mr
Hardy
whose
wife
Jacqueline
was
driving
when
the
accident
happened
said
later
The
father
was
determined
not
to
let
his
baby
die
He
was
obviously
in
control
and
kept
repeating
Don't
go
on
me
don't
go
on
me
After
I
breathed
six
or
seven
times
into
the
baby's
mouth
his
eyes
slowly
opened
and
he
coughed
feebly
then
more
vigorously
until
he
was
crying
Another
motorist
Samantha
Lee
from
Norwich
pulled
Andrew
from
the
ditch
after
seeing
his
head
bobbing
She
said
He
was
so
pleased
and
kept
saying
Thank
you
lady
Norfolk
Police
said
Joshua
had
been
very
lucky
Mr
and
Mrs
McNulty
received
cuts
Their
other
sons
have
been
discharged
from

in
Gorleston

Mr
McNulty
said
Words
cannot
express
how
grateful
I
am
to
everyone
who
helped
us
at
the
scene
I
trained
in

Police
who
spoke

killer

said
he
seemed
unaware

murders

had
committed
Later
he
demanded
a
helicopter
be
put
at
his
disposal
before
contact
was
broken
off
Local
hospitals
worked
through
the
night
treating
the
victims
of
an
outrage
that
began
on
a
quiet
Sunday
afternoon
when
the
gunman
pulled
an
automatic
rifle
from
a
tennis
bag
and
opened
fire
in
a
crowded
cafe
It
is
the
worst
massacre
in
Australia's
history
and
the
final
death
toll
is
expected
to
rise
The
dead
included
two
Canadians
tourists
of
Asian
origin
and
Australians
from
Tasmania
and
the
mainland
states
Extra
staff
were
brought
in
additional
beds
made
available
and
the
Royal
Hobart
Hospital
appealed
for
blood
donors
Relatives
of
the
killer
who
comes
from
a
Hobart
suburb
and
has
a
history
of
mental
illness
were
helping
the
police
The
victims
were
struck
down
at
Port
Arthur
a
former
convict
settlement
about
miles
from
Hobart
More
than
Australian
and
foreign
tourists
were
visiting
the
historic
site
when
the
lone
gunman
walked
into
a
cafe
and
opened
fire
One
witness
heard
him
mutter
There
are
a
lot
of
Wasps
White
Anglo-Saxon
Protestants
around
here
there
are
not
many
Japs
before
opening
fire
The
man
described
as
a
blond
surfie-type
then
went
outside
and
began
shooting
at
tourist
buses
in
the
car
park
The
driver
of
a
coach
and
some
of
his
passengers
were
killed
Passing
motorists
and
people
entering
the
toll
booth
entrance
to
the
museum
were
also
sprayed
with
bullets
Phillip
Milburn
who
witnessed

bang
bang
bang
It
was
bang
and
then
he'd
pick
someone
else
out
and
line
them
up
and
shoot
them
Wendy
Scurr
who
was
working
at
the
site's
reception
desk
said
she
believed
children
were
among
the
victims
She
said
her
first
reaction
was
to
shout
for
help
and
then
run
for
my
life
along
with
hundreds
of
others
A
few
minutes
later
customers
were
thrown
into
panic
as
the
gunman
entered
the
bar
of
the
nearby
Fox
and
Hounds
pub
which
was
packed
with
Sunday
lunchtime
drinkers
and
started
firing
He
left
the
bar
as
calmly
as
he
arrived
placing
his
weapon
in
a
tennis
bag
before
climbing
into
a
car
with
a
surfboard
on
the
roof
and
driving
to
a
remote
holiday
guest-house
There
he
took
three
hostages
and
repelled
police
by
taking
pot
shots
at
advancing
officers
He
also
fired
at
helicopters
as
they
ferried
the
injured
to
hospital
in
Hobart
A
police
spokesman
said
the
gunman
was
in
a
strong
position
to
defend
himself
because
there
was
water
on
one
side
of
the
building
and
open
land
around
the
rest
The
owners
of
the
Seascape
guest-house
David
and
Sally
Martin
were
being
held
hostage
the
Melbourne
Age
newspaper
reported
It
was
believed
that
there
was
an
arsenal
of
weapons
which
belonged
to
the
owner's
son
in
the
guest-house
We're
aware
of
weapons
that
were
in
the
house
As
to
whether
they're
in
operable
condition

Police

Bob
Fielding

this

What
we

that
he's

a
high-powered
weapon
and
he's

said
Tony
Rundell
the
State
Premier
said
All
Tasmanians

John

the

expressed
his

at
what
he
described
as
this
senseless
murder
John
Johnson
the

done
this
no
one
knows
but
if
he's
done
it
to
make
some
point
in
life
he's
made
that
point
Now's
the
time
to
come
out
and
avoid
any
more
bloodshed
All
I'm
hoping
is
that
he
will
realise
the
terrible

himself
up

West
Yorkshire
said
he
thought
Joshua
his
youngest
son
was
dead
after
the
crash
near
Great
Yarmouth
Norfolk
on
Friday
The
baby
was
thrown
clear
in
the
crash
which
left
the
family's
car
on
its
side
in
a
dyke
on
the
A47
Mr
McNulty
kicked
his
way
through
the
Ford
Escort's
sunroof
and
found
that
his
wife
and
two
other
sons
Daniel
and
Andrew
had
scrambled
to
safety
The
baby
however
was
no
longer
in
his
seat
It
was
only
when
a
passing
motorist
Samantha
Lee
a
housewife
from
Lakenham
Norwich
noticed
the
boy's
red
and
blue
spotted
cardigan
that
they
realised
he
was
face
down
in
the
water
Mr
McNulty
said
I
realised
that
there
had
been
five
of
us
in
the
car
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
baby
I
thought
at
first
that
he
was
under
the
car
seat
but
he
was
not
there
Then
I
got
into
the
water
which
was
waist
deep
but
could
not
find
him
and
I
just
started
thrashing
around
looking
for
him
Mr
McNulty
a
landscape
gardener
said
Our
luggage
had
spilt
out
everywhere
and
I
kept
on
picking
up
items
of
clothing
I
was
frantic
because
there
were
so
many
clothes
in
the
water
and
everything
looked
like
a
baby
I
was
desperate
he
said
Someone
shouted
He's
behind
you
and
I
turned
to
see
his
cardigan
I
pulled
at
it
and
there
he
was
and
I
lifted
him
on
to
the
side
I
don't
know
what
death
looks
like
but
he
looked
like
he
had
gone
The
baby
had
no
pulse
and
was
not
breathing
Although
Mr
McNulty
is
a
trained
first
aider
he
had
never
revived
anyone
but
he
massaged
the
baby's
heart
while
another
motorist
Alex
Hardy
from
Lowestoft
Suffolk
gave
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation
for
what
seemed
like
hours
I
just
tried
not
to
panic
and
said
to
myself
You
know
what
to
do
Now
just
do
it
I
said
I
am
not
letting
you
go
In
reality
I
think
we
were
treating
him
for
about
a
minute
It
was
just
so
wonderful
to
see
him
come
back
to
life
and
to
hear
him
cry
He
coughed
and
started
crying
and
I
knew
then
that
he
was
all
right
and
then
I
fainted
Mr
McNulty
said
Mr
Hardy
a
production
manager
at
a
Bird's
Eye
factory
in
Lowestoft
Suffolk
said
although
he
had
undergone
a
works
training
course
in
first
aid
he
had
never
given
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation
before
either
Mrs
Lee
said
afterwards
I
was
driving
behind
when
I
saw
the
car
go
off
the
road
I
saw
the
man
in
the
water
and
shouted
to
him
that
I
could
see
the
baby
face
down
I
then
watched
while
they
gave
him
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation
and
then
heard
him
cough
That
cough
was
really
something
I
picked
him
up
and
cuddled
him
for
joy

It
landed

Police
were
alerted
by
a
lorry
driver
who
narrowly
escaped
injury
when
the
raft
plummeted

a
tree
The
chute
was
described
by
Thames

The
chute
was
stored
in
the

Bomb
on
crowded
bus
kills
in
Pakistan
A
POWERFUL
bomb
ripped
through
a
bus
in
Pakistan
yesterday
killing
at
least
people
Most
of
the
passengers
were
returning
home
to
celebrate
the
Muslim
festival
of
Eid
al-Adha
A
second
bomb
was
found
near
the
wrecked
bus
and
safely
defused
the
official
Associated
Press
of
Pakistan
news
agency
said
The
high-intensity
bomb
left
people
critically
wounded
in
Bhai
Peru
a
town
about
miles
from
Lahore
the
capital
of
the
Pakistani
state
of
Punjab
Most
of
the
victims
were
burnt
to
death
inside
the
bus
which
caught
fire
immediately
after
the
explosion
At
least
people
were
killed
on
the
spot
while
four
others
died
on
the
way
to
hospital
Five
women
and
six
children
were
among
the
dead
Rescue
workers
said
the
bodies
were
so
badly
burnt
they
were
hardly
recognisable
The
overloaded
bus
was
carrying
more
than
passengers
with
many
sitting
on
the
roof
The
bomb
planted
under
the
seat
over
the
petrol
tank
exploded
as
the
vehicle
drove
through
the
town's
bazaar
An
ambulance
driver
who
arrived
on
the
scene
a
few
minutes
after
the
explosion
described
the
bus
as
a
fireball
He
said
people
trapped
inside
it
were
screaming
for
help
There
was
no
fire
extinguisher
available
and
we
helplessly
watched
them
dying
as
no
one
could
go
near
the
burning
bus
he
said
Only
the
people
sitting
on
the
roof
survived
The
driver
and
the
conductor
of
the
bus
also
escaped
as
they
managed
to
jump
out
of
the
burning
vehicle
Doctors
said
that
most
of
those
taken
to
hospital
were
in
serious
condition
with
third-degree
burns
The
death
toll
is
expected
to
rise
The
badly
charred
bodies
were
later
buried
in
a
common
grave
Benazir
Bhutto
the
Prime
Minister
of
Pakistan
described
the
blast
as
a
dastardly
act
She
said
in
a
statement
The
fact
that
terrorists
chose
the
auspicious
occasion
of
Eid
al-Adha
for
committing
such
a
heinous
act
showed
they
had
no
respect
even
for
the
most
pious
day
of
Islam
The
Government
will
not
compromise
with
terrorists
and
will
fight
them
till
the
last
of
them
is
brought
to
book
But
she
mentioned
no
name
or
organisation
that
she
believed
could
be
responsible
and
nobody
has
yet
claimed
responsibility
for
the
bus
bomb
Sardar
Mohammed
Arif
Nakai
the
Chief
Minister
of
the
province
also
condemned
the
act
of
terrorism
He
said
the
bombing
was
carried
out
by
forces
which
wanted
to
create
anarchy
in
the
country
He
too
did
not
name
any
group
or
foreign
country
Punjab
Pakistan's
largest
province
has
been
rocked
by
a
series
of
bomb
blasts
in
the
past
months
Earlier
this
month
a
charitable
cancer
hospital
in
Lahore
set
up
by
Imran
Khan
the
former
cricket
hero
and
aspiring
politician
was
targeted
by
unidentified
bombers
The
explosion
killed
seven
people
and
devastated
part
of
the
hospital
There
have
been
other
bomb
blasts
on
buses
in
different
parts
of
the
province
but
yesterday's
incident
was
by
far
the
worst
Last
week
Miss
Bhutto
said
that
her
Government
had
received
intelligence
reports
claiming
that
Punjab
would
be
targeted
by
foreign-sponsored
terrorists
an
obvious
reference
to
neighbouring
India
Pakistani
officials
have
often
accused
India
of
being
responsible
for
acts
of
sabotage
in
the
border
area
to
punish
Islamabad
for
its
political
support
of
separatist

DOUBTS
were
raised
over
the
safety
of
America's
booming
low-fare
airlines
yesterday
after
a
DC-9
plunged
like
a
bullet
into
the
swampy
Florida
Everglades
at
the
weekend
killing
all
passengers
and
crew
including
two
Britons
The
aircraft
which
was
flying
from
Miami
to
Atlanta
was
operated
by
ValuJet
a
budget
carrier
which
had
been
under
intense
scrutiny
by
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
following
a
string
of
incidents
Yesterday
it
emerged
that
the
year-old
jet
had
been
forced
to
return
to
airports
seven
times
in
the
last
two
years
because
of
minor
safety
problems
though
it
passed
an
FAA
inspection
last
week
The
FAA
had
recently
expressed
concern
over
a
significant
decrease
in
the
experience
level
of
ValuJet's
low-paid
pilots
after
an
investigation
into
several
runway
accidents
including
a
fire
last
June
that
injured
seven
people
and
destroyed
a
DC-9
Yesterday
ValuJet's
president
Lewis
Jordan
conceded
that
he
paid
his
pilots
half
the
basic
salary
of
other
airlines
but
insisted
I
don't
think
you
increase
the
level
of
safety
by
the
amount
you
pay
Flight
disappeared
from
radar
screens
minutes
after
the
pilot
had
reported
smoke
in
the
cockpit
and
requested
permission
to
return
to
Miami
The
twin-engine
jet
was
approximately
miles
west
of
Miami
international
airport
when
it
dived
to
the
ground
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
according
to
Daniel
Muelhaupt
who
saw
the
crash
from
his
small
plane
nearby
The
wreckage
was
like
if
you
take
your
garbage
and
just
throw
it
on

ground
By
the
time
rescuers
reached
the
remote
crash
scene
the
alligator-infested
swamp
appeared
to
have
swallowed
up
most
of
the
aircraft
Searchers
found
only
fragments
of
debris
and
a
few
personal
effects
Two
Britons
Devlin
and
Roger
Loughney
were

passengers
ValuJet
said
It
gave
no
further
details
Rescue
officials
formally
abandoned
the

for
survivors
yesterday
Investigators
from
the
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
will
attempt
to
recover
the
bodies
and
establish
the
crash
cause
It
comes
as
a
bitter
blow
to
America's
cut-price
airlines
which
have
enjoyed
rampant
growth
by
paring
costs
to
the
bone
and
operating
older
second-hand
jets
Atlanta-based
ValuJet
started
with
two
jets
in
and
now
serves
cities
with
a
fleet
of
aircraft
In
January
three
ValuJet
aircraft
were
involved
in
airport
incidents
including
two
in
which
the
jets
skidded
off
icy
runways
The
FBI
mounted
a

inquiry

quick
yesterday
to
play
down
talk
of
a

intervention
possibly
by

Donald
Dewar
to
ease
the
widely
documented
coolness
between
Mr
Brown
and

As
with

these
are
not

in
Labour's
upper
ranks
with
Mr

criticised
by
some
shadow
colleagues
both
for
his
dogged
austerity
over

and
what
critics
see
as
the
free
rein
Mr
Blair
gives
him
to
roam
across
departmental
boundaries
to
initiate
policy
There
are
too
many
backbench
MPs
who
feel
they
are
onlookers
required
to
defend

they
have
not
been
briefed
on

One

Clarke's
tax
hint
despite
past
error
THE
Chancellor
Kenneth
Clarke
yesterday
stepped
up
his
guerrilla
warfare
against
the
Tory
right
by
insisting
that
his
cautious
approach
to
tax
and
spending
cuts
may
yet
yield
a
budget
dividend
provided
economic
growth
this
summer
justifies
his
own
optimism
But
Mr
Clarke
gave
a
significant
hostage
to
political
fortune
when
he
conceded
that
John
Major's
government
made
a
genuine
mistake
in
its
handling
of
precisely
the
same
policies
in
the
run-up
to
the
last
general
election
in
Labour
immediately
said
it
justified
Gordon
Brown's
calls
for
an
independent
audit
of
Treasury
figures
The
Chancellor's
confession
will
not
win
him
friends
in
the
Tory
ranks
where
simpler
rightwingers
want
early
tax
cuts
and
more
sophisticated
allies
of
John
Redwood
are
detecting
an
inflationary
surge
which
would
hit
the
economy
only
after
the
election
The
money
supply
is
rising
at
per
cent
a
year
which
should
boost
consumer
spending
before
the
election
Mr
Redwood
said
last
night
There
is
no
problem
with
the
RPI
before
the
election
The
Chancellor
is
right
about
that
But
are
we
creating
conditions
for
inflation
in
months
or
two
years
time
Despite
a
weak
first
quarter
Mr
Clarke
stuck
to
his
optimistic
prediction
that
growth
will
touch
per
cent
this
year
enough
to
leave
room
for
tax
cuts
unless
overturned
by
unforeseen
events
He
also
repeated
his
defence
of
strong
welfare
spending
made
in
an
interview
with
the
Observer
and
cheekily
insisted
that
the
vast
majority
of
Conservative
MPs
agree
that
taxes
can
only
be
cut
when
it's
an
honest
thing
to
do
and
not
at
at
the
expense
of
schools
hospital
or
police
budgets
The
Chancellor
told
BBC1's
On
the
Record
viewers
yesterday
that
public
spending
was
under
control
But
the
tax
revenues
are
down
and
we
do
have
to
re-adjust
to
that
he
said
We
are
borrowing
more
than
I
intended
and
I
have
conceded
that
all
the
way
through
That
lies
behind
the
message
I
have
given
in
my
speeches
He
added
We
have
a
tax-cutting
agenda
I
am
a
tax-cutting
Chancellor
by
instinct
But
this
is
a
sophisticated
world
When
I
cut
taxes
you
will
know
they
will

No
hope
for
on
jet
that
fell
like
a

Only
hours
after
a
domestic
jetliner
plunged
into
Florida's
Everglades
swamp
with
people
on
board
including
two
British
passengers
rescuers
called
off
the
search
for
survivors
yesterday
They
said
the

appeared
to
have
bored
into
the
swamp
like
a
power
drill
on
Saturday
and
either
disintegrated
or
was
swallowed
up
by
mud
and
quicksand
The

for

and
the

continued
using
helicopters
and
airboats
fan-driven
swamp

which
cut
through

denied
that
the

had
been
too
old
but
admitted
it
had

Lt

a

with

branch
of

I

was
whether
that

what
they

I
thought

Luis
Fernandez
a

shrugged
off
mosquitoes
and
dragonflies
and
said
We
have
not

any

we
have
not

we
have

The
biggest

which
cuts
through
the
swamp
known
as
The

of

on
the
edge
of
the
Miccosukee
Indian
reservation
But
rescue
workers
described
an
eerie
silence
yesterday
in
the
area
where
the
aircraft
went
down
like
a
bullet
at
a
degree
angle
according
to
Dan
Muelhaupt
a
light
aircraft
pilot
who
saw
the
crash
I
thought
at
first
it
was
a
small
plane
doing
some
kind
of
aerial
manoeuvres
then
I
realised
it
was
a
passenger
jet
out
of
control
When
it
hit
the
swamp
there
was
a
fireball
of
dirt
and
debris
like
a
mushroom

Another
pilot
said
the
aircraft
white
with
a
pale
blue
sailplane
and
yellow
trim
bored
into
the
swamp
like
a
power
drill
Mr
Muelhaupt
said
the
biggest
piece
of
debris
he
saw
as
he
overflew
the
site
appeared
to
be
a
jet
engine
but
by
yesterday
there
was
no
sign
of
an
engine
or
any
sizeable
debris
according
to
local
television
cameramen
in
the
area
in
helicopters
It's
quicksand
out
there
It
doesn't
have
a
bottom
said
Harold
Johnson
a
local
fisherman
It
may
have
just
swallowed
that
plane
up
Jim
Ries
a
Florida
wildlife
official
said
the
water
in
the
area
is
about
ft
deep
at
present
In
the
rainy
season
in
the
summer
it
reaches
ft
or
more
But
below
that
there's
muck
and
mud
and
it
can
be
very
deep
The
plane
could
be
buried
in
there
The
DC-9
jet
of
the
Atlanta-based
cut-price
ValuJet
airline
crashed
about
miles
northwest
of
the
airport
It
had
been
returning
to
the
airport
after
the
pilot
reported
smoke
in
the
cockpit
Rescue
workers
set
up
a
command
post
on
a
levee
a
man-made
dirt
causeway
through
the
swamp
and
searched
the
area
by
helicopter
and
local
airboats
flat-bottomed
hydrofoils
driven
by
huge
fan-like
propellers
The
airboats
normally
used
to
ferry
tourists
through
the
square-mile
Everglades
to
see
alligators
snakes
and
rare
birds
were
the
only
way
to
reach
the
site
But
by
am
yesterday
despite
clear
weather
rescue
officials
said
they
had
called
off
the
search
for
survivors
We
have
divers
out
there
but
the
water
is
so
murky
they
can't
see
more
than
an
inch
in
front
of
their
faces
They're
literally
feeling
their
way
around
groping
said
Mr
Fernandez
They're
wearing
protective
clothing
We're
concerned
about
a
fuel
explosion
There
are
usually
poisonous
snakes
and
alligators
in
that
area
but
they
probably
got
well
out
of
there
after
the
crash
Among
the
ideas
under
consideration
is
a
grid
system
with
divers
probing
small
areas
one
by
one
or
draining
the
entire
area
by
building
dams
and
dykes
Miami
police
sealed
off
an
area
of
three
miles
radius
around
the
crash
site
and
warned
airboat
owners
they
would
be
arrested
if
they
entered
the
zone
The
security
measures
led
to
initial
speculation
that
authorities
feared
the
crash
might
have
been
the
result
of
a
terrorist
attack
ValuJet
is
based
in
Atlanta
Georgia
site
of
this
year's
Olympic
Games
but
officials
said
the
measures
were
because
of
fears
that
the
jet's
fuel
could
catch
fire
or
explode
Last
night
the
local
Channel
television
station
quoted
an
unnamed
passenger
who
had
flown
into
Miami
on
the
same
aircraft
earlier
on
Saturday
as
saying
that
it
had
had
several
problems
before
and
during
the
flight
They
seemed
to
keep
checking
the
engines
before
we
took-off
Then
the
intercom
went
down
during
the
flight
and
the
stewardesses
used
megaphones
to
talk
to
us

Fundholding
GPs
cannot
cope
Watchdog
says
doctors
have
neither
skills
nor
drive
to
make
health
scheme
work
A
devastating
indictment
of
the
Government's
flagship
health
care
scheme
GP
fundholding
is
to
be
delivered
by
an
independent
public
spending
watchdog
The
Audit
Commission
report
drafts
of
which
have
been
sent
to
ministers
and
the
British
Medical
Association
challenges
the
Government's
claims
that
the
system
is
providing
better
care
to
the
patient
and
saving
money
for
the
taxpayer
The
report
to
be
published
next
week
concludes
that
GP-dominated
purchasing
of
NHS
care
is
not
desirable
One
reason
given
is
few
GPs
have
the
skills
or
motivation
to
manage
large
practices
fully
and
competently
The
findings
will
reinforce
Labour's
claims
that
GP
fundholders
should
be
brought
within
the
scope
of
NHS
plans
in
joint
commissioning
of
care
by
family
doctors
Harriet
Harman
Labour's
health
spokeswoman
said
last
night
If
this
leak
is
accurate
it
shows
the
commission
report
supports
Labour's
case
for
changing
fundholding
so
that
all
GPs
work
with
hospitals
and
health
authorities
to
shape
patient
care
The
report
a
copy
of
which
has
been
obtained
by
the
Independent
could
prove
embarrassing
for
the
Government
as
it
embarks
on
a
consultation
exercise
to
boost
the
range
of
services
being
offered
by
GPs
Stephen
Dorrell
the
Secretary
of
State
for
Health
has
rejected
the
advice
to
the
Prime
Minister
in
the
Maples
letter
to
keep
the
NHS
out
of
the
headlines
in
the
run-up
to
the
general
election
He
is
facing
Labour's
challenge
head-on
by
claiming
that
the
success
of
GP
fundholding
has
put
Ms
Harman
on
the
defensive
over
her
plans
to
replace
it
But
the
report
while
not
attacking
the
principle
of
fundholding
questions
ministerial
claims
that
the
system
is
the
driving
force
for
innovation
in
the
NHS
Many
fundholders
are
under-performing
or
making
purchasing
decisions
which
represent
less
than
the
best
possible
value
for
money
Some
fundholders
have
begun
to
re-shape
services
in
a
fundamental
way
to
the
benefit
of
patients
but
the
report
says
for
others
the
great
majority
of
their
purchasing
is
for
the
same
services
in
the
same
quantities
delivered
in
the
same
way
by
the
same
providers
hospitals
and
with
few
measurable
extra
benefits
to
patients
It
says
Most
fundholders
are
not
making
full
use
of
the
increasing
body
of
knowledge
about
clinical
effectiveness
to
inform
their
commissioning
decisions
One
reason
is
that
they
face
conflicting
demands
from
their
patients
Fundholders
were
increasingly
purchasing
services
such
as
physiotherapy
counselling
and
complementary
therapies
because
they
were
requested
by
the
patients
but
they
had
not
been
proven
to
be
effective
Few
fundholders
met
Patient's
Charter
day
surgery
targets
and
most
were
failing
to
maximise
efficiency
savings
from
day
surgery
mainly
because
the
GPs
still
leave
it
to
the
consultant
to
decide
One
of
the
most
controversial
findings
is
over
the
use
of
savings
by
fundholders
which
should
be
recycled
into
patient
care
The
GPs
are
urged
to
try
to
improve
direct
patient
care
for
example
by
reducing
waiting
lists
by
buying
more
surgery
from
hospitals
before
investing
the
money
in
their
premises
from
which
the
GPs
could
gain
personal
benefit
As
a
check
on
how
the
savings
are
spent
the
GPs
are
supposed
to
provide
a
savings
plan
for
the
health
authority
to
approve
but
half
of
fundholders
supplied
no
plans
There
are
reports
that
thousands
of
pounds
were
spent
on
a
swimming
pool
built
beside
one
GP
surgery
supposedly
for
patients
Savings
varied
from
a
few
thousand
pounds
in
some
areas
to
more
than
in
others
The
report
warns
that
windfalls
from
late
invoicing
by
hospitals
for
work
carried
out
for
GPs
will
result
in
higher
prices
elsewhere
in
the
NHS
unless
they
act
as
a
stimulus
for
the
hospital
to
improve
efficiency
The
Government's
White
Paper
proposing
fundholding
in
envisaged
GPs
would
compete
for
patients
and
that
patients
would
move
to
practices
offering
the
best
services
says
the
report
There
is
no
evidence
that
patients
are
changing
practice
in
large
numbers
for
reasons
other
than
changing
address
Fundholding
practices
are
more
likely
than
non-fundholding
GPs
to
offer
a
wide
range
of
services
of
all
kinds
at
the
practice
but
this
is
often
because
of
reasons
which
pre-date
their
entry
into
fundholding
The
commission
found
that
a
few
fundholding
practices
had
achieved
fundamental
changes
but
the
majority
had
focused
on
one
or
two
significant
gains
for
their
patients
The
reason
for
the
inertia
was
partly
due
to
the
fear
patients
could
be
put
off
by
some
changes
The
GPs
are
also
expected
to
have
purchasing

SAFETY
standards
at
ValuJet
the
cheap-flights
airline
that
has
grown
from
nothing
to
a
major
US
carrier
in
less
than
three
years
emerged
yesterday
as
one
of
the
questions
surrounding
the
DC-9
crash
in
the
Everglades
that
killed
all
people
on
board
As
rescuers
called
off
the
hopeless
search
for
survivors
in
the
swamp
that
swallowed
up
the
jet
when
it
crashed
miles
from
Miami
airport
on
Saturday
federal
investigators
began
their
inquiry
Federico
Pena
the
Transportation
Secretary
flew
over
the
crash
site
as
rescuers
and
investigators
admitted
that
the
recovery
of
the
aircraft
the
victims
and
the
crucial
black
boxes
represented
one
of
the
most
difficult
operations
in
aircraft
accident
history
The
Federal
Aviation
Administration
has
still
not
completed
its
final
report
on
the
special
emphasis
investigation
that
it
undertook
in
February
after
a
series
of
mishaps
involving
ValuJet
planes
At
the
time
FAA
inspectors
looked
at
every
aspect
of
ValuJet's
operations
particularly
at
the
experience
of
pilots
and
other
aircrew
and
at
the
standards
of
maintenance
Preliminary
findings
did
not
uncover
any
major
shortcomings
and
only
last
month
Mr
Pena
told
journalists
concerned
about
ValuJet's
safety
record
that
it
is
a
safe
airline
like
all
other
airlines
However
Lewis
Jordan
ValuJet
president
admitted
yesterday
that
in
discussions
with
FAA
officials
the
company
had
agreed
to
slow
its
rate
of
growth
Until
Saturday
it
had
aircraft
but
plans
to
increase
this
to
by
the
end
of
the
year
had
been
cut
back
to
in
the
FAA
talks
The
company
had
also
at
its
own
volition
embarked
on
additional
training
for
both
air
and
ground
crew
Mr
Jordan
said
adding
that
the
captain
of
the
crashed
jet
had
logged
more
than
hours
as
a
ValuJet
pilot
Mr
Pena
said
that
because
of
the
rapid
expansion
of
the
airline
the
FAA
had
expressed
concerns
about
the
experience
of
pilots
and
maintenance
supervisors
But
he
said
ValuJet
had
taken
steps
to
rectify
the
situation
including
curtailing
its
latest
expansion
plans
Among
the
problems
encountered
by
the
fledgling
airline
have
been
several
minor
runway
accidents
involving
its
jets
a
fire
last
year
that
destroyed
a
DC-9
on
the
ground
at
its
home
base
of
Atlanta
and
safety
concerns
over
second-hand
engines
bought
from
Turkey
There
had
been
no
fatalities
before
Saturday's
crash
Flight
with
passengers
and
a
crew
of
five
was
about
miles
into
a
flight
from
Miami
to
Atlanta
when
the
captain
reported
smoke
in
the
cockpit
It
was
attempting
to
return
to
Miami
when
Daniel
Muelhaupt
pilot
of
a
small
aircraft
saw
the
year-old
jet
plunge
into
the
swamp
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
It
shot
like
a
bullet
into
the
ground
he
said
When
it
hit
the
ground
the
water
and
dirt
flew
up
It
looked
like
a
bomb
went
off
The
cause
of
the
fire
is
the
priority
of
investigators
but
the
DC-9
was
believed
to
have
had
older-type
black
boxes
that
do
not
offer
the
complete
analysis
of
a
plane's
electrical
and
mechanical
systems
as
more
modern
versions
Rescuers
were
trying
to
determine
how
to
retrieve
the
aircraft
which
apart
from
scattered
debris
is
buried
in
a
small
area
of
peat
beneath
about
five
feet
of
water
in
the
swamp
It
seems
a
yard
roadway
from
the
nearest
piece
of
solid
ground
will
have
to
be
built
to
enable
heavy
lifting
equipment
to
reach
the
site
They
are
the
worst
possible
conditions
Rescuers
sink
up
to
their
chests
in
the
water
and
we
believe
the
aircraft
is
buried
in
the
peat
a
Dade
County
Rescue
spokesman
said
ValuJet
started
operations
in
October
with
ageing
DC-9s
bought
from
Delta
Airlines
including
the
one
that
crashed
on
Saturday
offering
discount
fares
on
no-frills
internal
flights
It
now
serves
American
cities
and
doubled
its
profits
last
year
The
age
and
type
of
the
aircraft
that
crashed
is
not
at
this
stage
considered
a
major
factor
it
had
a
complete
strip-down
inspection
last
October
and
received
a
routine
air-worthiness
inspection
only
last
week
We
don't
have
any
more
concerns
about
the
DC-9
than
any
other
aircraft
said
Robert
Francis
vice-chairman
of
the
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
Although
the
aircraft
had
had
to
return
to
airports
seven
times
in
the
past
two
years
none
of
the
problems
was
considered
major
and
all
were
corrected
The
happiest
man
in
Miami
last
night
was
Terry
Huckabee
who
had
complained
to
staff
at
the
airport
that
he
was

IRA
primed
for
return
to
violence
THE
IRA
is
fully
primed
for
a
return
to
all-out
violence
in
Northern
Ireland
according
to
intelligence
assessments
Although
a
debate
is
taking
place
within
the
IRA
about
whether
to
call
a
fresh
ceasefire
any
truce
would
be
tactical
and
based
on
the
premise
that
all-party
talks
are
doomed
to
failure
The
intelligence
picture
casts
a
shadow
over
the
Government's
plans
for
all-party
talks
on
June
as
Northern
Ireland's
parties
begin
their
campaigns
for
the
forum
elections
on
May
Ministers
believe
that
consensus
could
emerge
during
the
talks
Throughout
the
ceasefire
the
IRA
retrained
recruited
and
reorganised
Weapons
were
moved
and
dummy
runs
carried
out
constantly
one
intelligence
source
said
Republican
goals
have
not
changed
and
the
will
to
achieve
them
is
as
strong
as
ever
There
have
also
been
indications
of
increased
loyalist
paramilitary
activity
adding
weight
to
calls
by
IRA
hardliners
to
abandon
the
unarmed
strategy
Sinn
Fein
however
is
under
pressure
from
London
and
Dublin
and
the
Irish
nationalist
lobby
in
America
to
deliver
a
second
ceasefire
so
it
can
take
part
in
the
talks
The
security
warnings
come
at
the
end
of
a
three-week
period
during
which
the
IRA
has
stopped
moving
its
weapons
and
ceased
making
dummy
runs
for
terrorist
operations
in
the
province
At
the
same
time
IRA
commanders
have
held
a
series
of
meetings
in
Belfast
Londonderry
and
south
Armagh
The
lack
of
IRA
activity
is
purely
so
the
meetings
can
be
held
the
source
said
Their
volunteers
are
fully
primed
and
in
place
in
Northern
Ireland
and
on
the
mainland
in
preparation
for
a
return
to
all-out
war
This
is
not
about
abandoning
the
armed
struggle
It
is
about
whether
the
already
discredited
political
strategy
should
be
ditched
now
or
in
a
month's
time
Very
few
within
the
republican
movement
believe
the
all-party
talks
offer
any
hope
of
progress
The
IRA
has
not
decided
on
its
next
move
But
the
arguments
are
about
tactics
rather
than
long-term
strategy
It
is
a
matter
of
when
rather
then
if
the
next
bomb
will
go
off
and
how
long
before
sectarian
violence
returns
to
Northern
Ireland
Northern
Ireland
Office
sources
said
that
an
IRA
ceasefire
was
possible
The
hope
is
that
if
all
the
parties
gather
around
the
table
such
a
momentum
will
develop
that
the
talks
will
eventually
lead
to
a
settlement
said
one
The
decision
on
whether
to
call
a
ceasefire
rests
with
the
seven
members
of
the
IRA's
army
council
In
the
autumn
three
of
its
members
from
south
Armagh
argued
successfully
that
the
bombing
campaign
on
the
mainland
should
be
renewed
Security
sources
said
that
some
Sinn
Fein
leaders
were
told
of
the
council's
decision
in
October
or
November
and
by
the
end
of
January
knew
the
date
the
Docklands
bomb
would
explode
Martin
McGuinness
Sinn
Fein's
chief
negotiator
said
yesterday
that
he
had
no
idea
whether
there
would
be
any
more
bombs
in
London
before
all-party
talks
Speaking
on
LWT's
Jonathan
Dimbleby
programme
he
said
that
he
believed
the
IRA
was
open
to
persuasion
over
the
question
of
a
second
ceasefire
I
think
that
the
IRA
when
they
called
their
ceasefire
in
August
which
they
maintained
for
some
months
clearly
showed
their
seriousness
and
their
commitment
to
the
search
for
a
resolution
of
the
conflict
in
Ireland
The
intelligence
source
said
Gerry
Adams
and
Martin
McGuinness
are
saying
to
the
IRA
leadership
that
a
new
ceasefire
would
secure
entry
to
all-party
talks
and
that
Unionists
would
then
make
demands
for
decommissioning
that
could
not
be
met
This
would
enable
republicans
to
seize
the
moral
high
ground
by
blaming
Unionists
for
the
breakdown
of
the
talks
But
IRA
commanders
in
the
border
counties
say
the
unarmed
strategy
has
failed
and
a
fresh
ceasefire
would
serve
no
purpose
Up
to
five
IRA
terrorist
groups
from
south
Armagh
and
Co
Monaghan
in
the
Irish
Republic
are
in
place
on
the
mainland
assessing
targets
and
conducting
dummy
runs
in
preparation
for
further
bombings
The
two
units
based
in
London
have
carried
out
five
unsuccessful
operations
since
Docklands
One
bomb
probably
planted
by
Edward
O'Brien
was
made
safe
after
being
found
in
a
West
End
telephone
kiosk
A
second
exploded
prematurely
on
a
bus
at
Aldwych
killing
O'Brien
and
seriously
injuring
passengers
Two
smaller
devices
went
off
in
west
London
but
caused
little
damage
The
Hammersmith
Bridge
bombs
among
the
largest
ever
to
be
planted
on
the
mainland
were
planned
to
be
a
spectacular
to
mark
the
th
anniversary
of
the
Easter
Rising
but
failed
to
go
off
even
though
the
detonators
were
activated
The
IRA
knew
that
the
loyalist
ceasefire
was
under
strain
and
blowing
up
people
in
London
would
have
led
to
a
loyalist
attack
in
Dublin
or
Northern
Ireland
the
source
said
Although
the
IRA
is
not
in
danger
of
splitting
there
are
clear
differences
of
opinion
between
those
leading
the
Belfast-based
Northern
Command
and
local
commanders
in
the
bandit
country
along
the
border
In
Belfast
the
tangible
benefits
of
the
ceasefire
led
to
a
greater
willingness
to
pursue
a
political
path
towards
a
united
Ireland
In
Armagh
however
the
months
of
peace
had
little
effect
on
everyday
life
and
did
not
shake
the
resolve
of
the
IRA
Its
South
Armagh
Brigade
is
controlled
by
a
tightly-knit
group
drawn
largely
from
five
families
who
direct
mainland
operations
in
addition
to
planning
attacks
in
their
own
areas
The
failure
so
far
of
the
London
bomb
campaign
is
probably
due
to
the
use
of
inexperienced
volunteers
sent
as
sleepers
before
the
ceasefire
broke
down

CONSERVATIVE

on
Kenneth

the

last
night
after
his
most
determined
attempt
yet
to
dampen
down

of
pre-election

cuts
Mr

admitted

that

was

that

had
made

mistake
on

forecasts
He
warned

that
there

no
slash
and
burn
policy
of
cutting
spending
on
essential
services
such
as
health
and
education
to

Conservatives
who
believe
that
tax

are

to
secure

general
election
victory
for
the
Tories
were

Bill

the

He

He
should
reconsider
his
position
He
is
admitting
that
there
is
no
reasonable
prospect
for
tax
cuts
It
is
his
fault
The
fundamental
mess
that
we
are
in
over
tax
cuts
is
the
direct
result
of
our
remaining
in
the
ERM
and
our
overshoot
on
borrowing
Euro-sceptic
MPs
also
blame
the
Government's
continued
adherence
to
the
Maastricht
convergence
criteria
for
possible
entry
into
a
single
currency
and
the
billion
extra
to
be
spent
because
of
the
EU
beef
ban
for
reducing
the

Mr

Legg
the
Tory
MP
for
Milton
Keynes
South
West
and
Patrick
Nicholls
a
former
Tory
minister
and
MP
for
Teignbridge
both
urged
the
Chancellor
to
tone
down
his
support
for
a
single

Mr
Legg
said
I
think
any
responsible
Chancellor
should
say
now
that
Britain
will
not
abandon
the
pound
and
go
into

Mr

Mr

fresh
display
of

comes
at
the
start
of

will
see
difficult
votes
in
the
Commons
on
the
Common
Agricultural

and
the

scandal

has

Westminster

Labour
seized
on
the
admission
that
the

forecasts
It
said
there

figures
are

above

Mr

was
adamant
that
he
would
not
bribe
the
electorate
with
hell
for
leather
tax
cuts
He
insisted
that
there
was
only
a
minority
of
MPs
who
felt
the
Tories
could
not
win
without
tax
reductions
Mr
Clarke
told
BBC1's
On
the
Record
programme
yesterday
I
think
the
vast
majority
of
Conservative
MPs
like
me
meet
people
all
the
time
who
do
not
want
to
be
given
tax
cuts
at
the
expense
of
the
schools
and
the
hospitals
and
the
police
because
Tory
voters
feel
as
strongly
about
resourcing
those
as
they
do
about
tax
cuts
Taxes
depend
on
public
spending
taxes
depend
on
demands
on
the
economy
and
we
will
cut
taxes
if
we
can
but
only
if
we
can
afford
it
only
if
we're
going
towards
a
balanced
budget
The
Chancellor
implied
that
the
billion
for
the
BSE
crisis
would
come
out
of
the
billion
reserves
set
aside
in
the
last
Budget
Mr
Clarke
admitted
that
the
Government
was
borrowing
more
than
it
expected
but
insisted
it
had
not
lost
control
of
public
spending
He
said
I
am
determined
to
get
borrowing
down
My
aim
has
always
been
to
get
it
down
to
balance
in
the
medium
term
A
Chancellor's
life
is
full
of
worries
but
a
Chancellor's
life
has
got
to
be
based
on
policy
commitments
that
keep
you
on
course
We
are
borrowing
more
than
I
intended
and
I
have
conceded
that
all
the
way
through
That
lies
behind
the
message
I
have
given

Those
who

tax
we
might
just
about

a

competition
at
Mile
End
Stadium
east
London
yesterday
But
the
tournament
organisers
hastily
arranged
a
special
extra
match
between
the
teams
So
it
was
that
with
screaming
girls
urging
the
two
sides
on
Blur
after
losing
out
to
Oasis
in
the
Brit
Awards
this
year
turned
the
tables
with
a
victory
Damon
Albarn
Blur's
singer
and
songwriter
was
plainly
overwhelmed
by
the
victory
and
could
only
manage
an
incisive
but
factually
correct
We
beat
Oasis
But
for
all
the
North-South
rivalry
generated
by
the
music
industry
PR
machines
the
gritty
fixture
was
a
model
of
sportsmanship
Albarn
stepped
up
to
the
halfway
line
before
the
kick-off
and
shook
hands
with
his
Oasis
opposite
number
Liam
Gallagher
Blur
took
the
lead
shortly
before
half
time
despite
Oasis
having
the
assistance
of
Robbie
Williams
the
former
Take
That
singer
The
interval
was
the
cue
for
the
kind
of
pitch
invasion
almost
unknown
these
days
in
the
professional
game
as
scores
of
girls
scaled
the
barriers
and
made
for
their
idols
With
the
kind
of
jinking
runs
and
determination
that
would
have
done
credit
to
Eric
Cantona
they
tried
in
vain
to
sidestep
the
numerous
security
guards
One
year-old
Michelle
Lawler
even
tried
it
topless
making
a
beeline
for
Gallagher
before
being
apprehended
by
one
of
the
bouncers
just
yards
from
her
target

Crew
may

before
jet
plunged
into
swamp
THE
crew
of
an
ageing
DC9
airliner
may
have
been
dead
or
unconscious
before
their
jet
plunged
into
the
Florida
Everglades
killing
all
on
board
including
two
British
tourists
Much
of
the
debris
had
been
sucked
into
the
swamp
before
rescuers
could
reach
the
jet
The
pilot
for
the
cut-price
domestic
airline
Valujet
had
told
air
traffic
controllers
that
the
cockpit
was
filling
with
smoke
minutes
after
he
took
off
from
Miami
for
Atlanta
As
he
turned
back
towards
the
airport
witnesses
say
the
year-old
aircraft
made
a
series
of
irrational
manoeuvres
banking
sharply
and
flying
at
an
angle
of
degrees
into
the
alligator-infested
swamp
Rescuers
gave
up
hope
of
finding
survivors
and
were
unable
to
locate
anything
more
than
fragments
of
the
jet
which
had
recently
suffered
engine
troubles
The
two
Britons
were
named
as
Roger
and
Devlin
Loughney
Teams
trying
to
recover
the
aircraft's
flight
recorder
which
had
a
radio
beacon
were
hampered
by
the
muddy
and
inhospitable
terrain
where
the
jet
crashed
on
Saturday
minutes
after
take-off
Attempts
to
build
a
road
across
the
swamp
were
abandoned
and
rescuers
were
considering
trying
to
drain
the
land
to
reach
the
site
Investigators
want
to
recover
the
bodies
of
the
crew
and
passengers
to
establish
whether
they
were
wearing
oxygen
masks
and
if
their
lungs
contained
enough
smoke
to
have
caused
them
to
black
out
A
fire
could
have
been
caused
by
an
electrical
fault
The
crash
will
raise
serious
doubts
about
the
safety
of
old
jets
being
used
by
cut-price
airlines
and
could
slow

FLECKS
of

in

were
virtually
all
there
was
to
show
yesterday
after
the
nosedive
crash
of
a
DC9
jet
that
killed
all
people
aboard
Emergency
workers
were
perplexed
and
appalled
by
a
crash
which
has
left
almost
no

It
appeared
that
ValuJet
Flight
either
exploded
into
smithereens
when
it
hit
the
ground
on
Saturday
afternoon
or
was
sucked
below
the
mud
and
waters
of
the
treacherous
Everglades
A
few
shards
of
fuselage
measuring
no
more
than
six
feet
were
all
that
was
left
of
the
aircraft
Witnesses
said
the
plane
plummeted
at
a

angle
It
was
terrible
Nothing
could
have
survived
that
said
Daniel
Muelhaupt
a
local
flying

who
had
been
giving
a
lesson
I
thought
it
was
doing
a
manoeuvre
but
it
didn't
pull
up
and
wham!
Mr
Muelhaupt
flew
to
the
scene
of
the
crash
and
his
pupil
Rick
DeLisle
used
field
glasses
to
search
for
survivors
but
saw
no
one
The
crash
was
also
watched
by
an
angler
Chris
Osceola
I
said
It's
gonna
crash
and
then
boom!
he
said
The
impact
threw
up
a
massive
mushroom-shaped
cloud
of
mud
smoke
and
spray
A
US
Coast
Guard
helicopter
en
route
from
an
air
show
to
Miami
was
in
the
vicinity
and
flew
at
once
to
the
crash
site
Lieutenant-Commander
Mark
Feldman
said
We
were
really
surprised
at
the
lack
of
debris
We
were
told
it
was
a
DC9
but
from
what
we
saw
we
simply
could
not
believe
it
There
was
some
clothing
nothing
else
and
nothing
we
could
do
The
year-old
jet
owned
by
the
discount
airline
ValuJet
had
a
recent
history
of
engine
troubles
Since
it
had
returned
to
airports
seven
times
after
taking
off
reporting
mechanical
snags
such
as
oil
leaks
and
hydraulic
pump
failures
Last
year
it
made
an
emergency
landing
at
Memphis
Tennessee
because
of
a
sudden
loss
of
cabin
pressure
Soon
after
taking
off
from
Miami
the
pilot
reported
smoke
in
the
cabin
The
plane
vanished
from
radar
screens
at
pm
minutes
after
it
left
for
Atlanta
Georgia
Salvage
teams
were
frustrated
by
the
muddy
terrain
The
Everglades
wetlands
cover
some
square
miles
of
the
land
west
of
Miami
and
many
parts
are
inaccessible
By
yesterday
afternoon
workers
had
still
to
retrieve
the
DC9's
black
box
flight
recorder
which
was
equipped
with
a
radio

Bulldozers
started
to
beat
a
path
to
the
crash
site
to
allow
heavy-lifting
machinery
a
chance
to
reach
the
area
but
the
road-building
exercise
had
to
be
called
off
because
of
the
marshiness
of
the
land
In
many
places
the
water
was
no
more
than
three
feet
deep
but
the
mud
underfoot
was
thick
and
glutinous
and
threatened
to
suck
men
and
machines
under
Luis
Fernandez
a
rescue
worker
said
There
were
a
lot
of
alligators
and
snakes
in
there
and
a
lot
of
the
debris
is
settling
into
the
muck
He
and
other
emergency
workers
were
distressed
when
they
came
across
a
family
photograph

and
baby
clothes
We're
all

In

DC9s
hit
a
snow
drift
at
Dulles

in
Washington
while
a
third

aeroplane
left
the
runway
in
Savannah
Georgia
and
in
March
an

was
activated
on
a
ValuJet
in
Tampa
Florida
Safety
experts
are
convinced
the
report
of
smoke
in
the
cockpit
of
the
DC9
is
consistent
with
the
crew
becoming
incapacitated
by
breathing
toxic
smoke
before
the
crash
A
number
of
in-flight
electrical
fires
especially
in
older
aircraft
with
worn
wiring
so
worried
pilots
from
other
airlines
that
they
urged
McDonnell
Douglas
to
re-write
the
plane's
manual
on
how
to
deal
with
such
an
emergency
Normally
pilots
would
put
on
oxygen
masks
immediately
they
smelt
the
smoke
But
if
they
were
distracted
or
had
some
problem
with
the
equipment
they
may
not
have
had

Head
of
peanut
airline
insists
his
budget
policy
is
no
threat
to
safety
VALUJET's
chief
executive
mounted
a
valiant
attempt
yesterday
to
save
the
low-budget
airline
that
in
three
years
has
proved
such
a
remarkable
success
Lewis
Jordan
dressed
in
a
dark
suit
portrayed
a
very
different
image
from
the
informality
of
ValuJet
flights
He
claimed
that
cost-paring
on
the
increasing
number
of
peanut
airlines
so
called
because
that
is
the
extent
of
in-flight
catering
does
not
compromise
safety
However
the
crash
raised
doubts
about
the
wisdom
of
flying
with
an
airline
whose
pilots
denied
the
customary
in-flight
sustenance
take
fast
food
into
the
cockpit
and
whose
cabin
attendants
conduct
frenetic
in-flight
quizzes
I
don't
see
any
connection
between
ValuJet's
growth
and
this
tragic
accident
said
Mr
Jordan
whose
fleet
of
second-hand
airliners
has
risen
from
two
to
in
three
years
and
whose
passenger
turnover
based
on
a
low-fare
no-frills
service
has
increased
by
per
cent
in
the
past
year
The
DC9
even
at
this
age
is
one
of
the
safest
jets
flying
today
There
is
no
way
to
explain
why
we
have
had
such
a
tragedy
In
March
however
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
FAA
noted
in
a
memorandum
that
investigators
had
found
a
significant
decrease
in
the
experience
level
of
new
pilots
being
hired
by
ValuJet
as
well
as
other
positions
such
as
mechanics
dispatchers
etc
Last
summer
after
fire
destroyed
a
ValuJet
DC9
at
Atlanta
airport
the
FAA
announced
special
inspections
of
aircraft
Mr
Jordan
had
bought
cheaply
in
Turkey
Anthony
Broderick
regulation
chief
for
the
FAA
said
The
basic
results
are
that
there
are
no
significant
safety
deficiencies
at
ValuJet
We
did
find
areas
where
they
could
improve
So
far
every
one
of
our
suggestions
has
been
taken
to
heart
and
adapted
very
quickly
by
ValuJet
Soon
after
the
crash
Mr
Jordan
said
ValuJet's
reputation
for
controlling
costs
should
not
be
misunderstood
The
company
willingly
and
enthusiastically
spends
whatever
is
appropriate
to
achieve
the
highest
levels
of
safety
At
this
point
we
have
no
information
that
tells
us
anything
about
this
crash
that
was
preventable
ValuJet
flies
to
cities
in
America
and
is
the
most
successful
of
the
peanut
airlines
characterised
by
stewardesses
in
mufti
and
captains
who
crack
bad
jokes
over
the
intercom
Its
rapid
growth
has
made
it
a
darling
of
Wall
Street
and
Mr
Jordan
with
his
cheap
fares
and
no-booking
ticket
policies
has
been
hailed
as
a
populist
and
an
innovator
Last
year
his
airline
reported
a
million
m
profit
on
sales
of
million
m
Other
airlines
have
taken
notice
and
thought
about
emulating
Mr
Jordan's
methods
The
Florida
crash
is
certain
to
make
passengers
question
the
entire
concept

They

More
than

involved
during

In

officers

Teams
of

from

will
be

However
operations
will
be

by
data
protection

that
restricts
the

European

For
example
Dutch
police
are
forbidden
to
supply

of
Dutch

they
believe
may
cause

Chief
Inspector
Lex
Heys
of

in
Utrecht
said
Our
Government
has
a

we
have
a

but
we

it
under

protection
legislation
Similar
restrictions
apply
in
Germany
and
Switzerland
But
senior
officers
are
playing
down

Hopefully
they
will
not
cause
us
too
much
of
a
problem
because
we
have

over
here
and
they

Detective

On

Gerry
and

all
playing
football
together
on

up
at

in

yesterday
to
play
soccer
for

at

unusually
early
hour
of

The

Albarn
and
Gallagher
even
made
a
show
of
walking
hand-in-hand
on
to
the
pitch
sparking
speculation
of
a
Britpop
reconciliation
But
the
way
each
of
them
rushed
off
to
sign
autographs
for
the
thousands
of
screaming
teenage
spectators
whenever
the
other
was
in
danger
of
hogging
the
limelight
suggested
that
their
gamesmanship
might
have
been
as
assiduous
off
the
field
as
on
Liam
Gallagher
is
frontman
to
one
of
the
world's
biggest-selling
bands
Oasis's
following
has
swelled
so
dramatically
that
it
has
been
forced
to
add
a
second
autumn
concert
at
Knebworth
after
selling
out
the
first
date
within
hours
and
Gallagher
milked
the
indulgence
teen
girls
give
to
their
hero
of
the
moment
In
the
absence
of
his
brother
and
fellow
Oasis-member
Noel
Liam
took
on
the
full
family
responsibility
of
clowning
of
teasing
and
snubbing
the
crowd
of
whipping
the
cap
from
a
St
John
Ambulanceman
of
drinking
beer
and
goofing
around
the
pitch
He
even
managed
to
score
a
goal
But
while
Oasis
and
Blur
might
rule
the
pop
charts
they
failed
to
make
as
big
a
success
of
Britsoc
as
that
have
of
Britpop
Both
bands
who
requested
that
they
should
not
face
each
other
in
the
early
rounds
of
the
six-a-side
contest
for
fear
of
inciting
brawls
among
their
rival
fans
made
a
selfless
contribution
to
law
and
order
by
both
getting
knocked
out
in
the
first
round
of
the
tournament
organised
in

New
signs
of
IRA
ceasefire
say
security
chiefs
THE
IRA
leadership
is
moving
towards
a
ceasefire
before
the
start
of
all-party
talks
on
Northern
Ireland
on
June
according
to
intelligence
assessments
in
London
Dublin
and
Belfast
In
marked
contrast
to
the
bleak
mood
in
security
circles
since
the
ceasefire
was
blown
to
smithereens
at
London's
Docklands
last
February
police
and
intelligence
officers
were
beginning
to
express
cautious
optimism
last
week
about
the
prospects
for
a
new
cessation
This
was
tempered
by
fears
that
it
may
be
preceded
by
a
final
attack
in
Britain
and
gloom
from
some
senior
Republican
sources
about
the
real
difficulties
in
bringing
the
IRA
on
board
One
source
said
the
fact
that
the
current
campaign
has
been
so
sporadic
as
well
as
being
confined
to
the
mainland
rather
than
in
Northern
Ireland
made
it
less
likely
A
security
source
said
The
next
few
weeks
are
going
to
be
a
period
of
intense
political
activity
and
we
think
they
want
to
be
part
of
it
The
IRA
knows
it
cannot
participate
if
it
does
not
call
a
ceasefire
and
if
it
does
not
call
a
ceasefire
it
has
nothing
potentially
to
gain
Gerry
Adams
and
those
who
advocate
a
primarily
political
strategy
are
beginning
to
recover
some
of
their
lost
influence
Speaking
to
the
Northern
Ireland
annual
meeting
of
Sinn
Fein
in
Belfast
yesterday
Mr
Adams
gave
no
hint
that
he
thought
a
ceasefire
might
be
imminent
He
said
it
was
unrealistic
to
expect
the
chasm
of
distrust
between
Sinn
Fein
and
the
Government
to
be
easily
bridged
while
the
talks
could
only
succeed
if
they
started
from
the
basis
that
nothing
is
agreed
until
everything
is
agreed
Later
he
told
the
Observer
that
London's
decision
last
week
to
allow
the
convicted
terrorist
Patrick
Kelly
to
be
moved
to
a
jail
in
the
Republic
to
be
near
his
family
because
he
is
dying
of
cancer
was
immaterial
in
increasing
the
chances
of
a
ceasefire
Kelly
was
expected
to
be
moved
yesterday
but
the
Home
Office
held
up
his
transfer
saying
it
had
not
received
the
necessary
documents
The
political
pressure
on
the
republican
leadership
is
intense
and
rising
One
of
Sinn
Fein's
strongest
supporters
in
the
United
States
Congress
warned
yesterday
that
the
American
government
would
not
get
involved
in
the
peace
process
again
until
there
was
another
ceasefire
Congressman
Peter
King
described
the
end
of
the
ceasefire
as
a
tragic
mistake
and
said
Sinn
Fein
would
get
little
if
any
support
in
the
US
until
it
was
reinstated
Later
the
Irish
Social
Welfare
Minister
Proinsias
de
Rossa
added
to
the
pressure
calling
on
the
IRA
to
allow
Sinn
Fein
to
take
part
in
the
June
talks
by
halting
the
violence
Sinn
Fein
has
a
case
to
make
and
a
constituency
to
represent
The
only
obstacle
to
the
party's
full
participation
in
negotiations
is
IRA
violence
nothing
more
he
said
John
Major
had
a
long
telephone
conversation
with
John
Bruton
the
Irish
Prime
Minister
last
Wednesday
Among
the
proposals
they
discussed
was
asking
George
Mitchell
the
former
US
senator
who
chaired
the
commission
on
decommissioning
terrorist
weapons
to
return
to
Northern
Ireland
Last
night
Mr
Adams
said
he
would
welcome
such
a
move
While
Britain
could
not
pretend
to
be
neutral
or
objective
Mr
Mitchell
was
regarded
by
all
sides
as
an
experienced
impartial
arbitrator

on

KENNETH
CLARKE
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
has
delivered
a
defiant
message
to
restless
Tory
backbenchers
portraying
himself
as
a
staunch
defender
of
the
welfare
state
who
refuses
to
make
deep
cuts
in
benefits
to
finance
reductions
in
income
tax
In
an
interview
with
the
Observer
Mr
Clarke
reiterated
his
refusal
to
compromise
in
the
face
of
attacks
from
the
Tory
Right
over
Europe
public
spending
and
taxation
He
also
placed
himself
to
the
left
of
Shadow
Chancellor
Gordon
Brown
over
the
contentious
issue
of
child
benefit
And
Mr
Clarke
admitted
that
he
had
set
highly
visible
and
public
targets
for
the
public
sector
borrowing
requirement
PSBR
over
the
past
three
years
in
order
to
give
a
rationale
for
resisting
the
clamour
for
tax
cuts
His
defence
of
child
benefit
for
to
year-olds
which
Mr
Brown
is
keen
to
cut
in
order
to
finance
extra
training
will
fuel
the
bitter
dispute
within
the
Labour
Party
over
the
issue
I
do
find
child
benefit
for
to
year-olds
the
most
extraordinary
place
to
go
to
finance
things
that
are
supposed
to
be
helping
youth
training
said
Mr
Clarke
Just
to
take
away
child
benefit
for
that
age
with
nothing
proposed
to
replace
it
hits
the
average
person
with
teenage
children
who
decide
to
stay
on
in
education
Speaking
at
Downing
Street
the
Chancellor
suggested
a
cautious
approach
to
the
reform
of
social
security
The
whole
country
is
now
seized
with
the
feeling
that
the
welfare
state
has
to
be
reformed
in
some
way
to
meet
modern
needs
and
be
made
affordable
he
said
I
do
find
that
interesting
but
I
don't
think
we
should
be
panicked
into
doing
things
which
would
damage
the
welfare
state
A
modern
European
state
requires
a
strong
welfare
state
to
increase
people's
willingness
to
accept
change
Mr
Clarke
admitted
that
he
intended
to
use
his
public
emphasis
on
the
need
to
cut
the
PSBR
the
gap
between
what
the
Government
spends
and
what
it
receives
to
fend
off
Tory
right-wingers
calls
for
big
pre-election
tax
cuts
Most
of
the
constraints
I
have
put
upon
myself
deliberately
he
said
I
have
used
my
own
rhetoric
to
put
constraints
on
myself
and
to
try
to
put
constraints
on
He
said
he
had
gone
in
for
much
more
openness
precisely
to
put
myself
in
a
bit
of
a
straitjacket
The
more
open
you
are
about
it
the
more
you
protect
yourself
from
the
pressures
of
people
saying
come
on
relax
a
bit
Mr
Clarke
spelt
out
the
thinking
behind
his
warning
delivered
at
the
Tories
Scottish
conference
last
week
that
tax
cuts
cannot
be
relied
on
to
buy
votes
Those
who
believe
if
I
took
a
penny
off
income
tax
we
might
just
about
have
a
photo-finish
to
the
election
and
with
tuppence
off
we'd
have
a
bit
of
a
working
majority
and
with
threepence
off
we'd
have
a
working
majority
I
think
are
treating
the
British
public
as
idiots
Mr
Clarke
is
refusing
to
compromise
his
position
on
the
Left
of
the
Conservative
Party
He
appears
to
be
giving
no
ground
either
to
the
rightwingers
led
by
John
Redwood
who
believe
that
spending
should
be
slashed
in
order
to
make
room
for
big
cuts
in
income
tax
or
to
those
on
the
populist
Right
who
are
keen
to
see
tax
cuts
even
if
the
Government's
finances
spiral
further
into
the
red
Indeed
he
is
raising
the
stakes
We
must
ensure
that
everybody
has
the
care
they
require
without
taking
away
incentives
from
people
who
have
made
provision
for
themselves
There's
a
lot
more
to
be
done
to
make
sure
we
have
a
social
security
system
that
is
a
proper
safety
net
has
proper
incentives
to
personal
responsibility
and
is
affordable
I
do
object
to
the
American-type
New
Right

wish
to
sweep
half
of
it
away

Russia's
top
ten

in

on
secret
M15
list
SECURITY
chiefs
in
M15
have
drafted
a
list
of
the
most
damaging
Russian
spies
in
Britain
They
would
have
been
deported
immediately
if
President
Boris
Yeltsin
had
carried
out
his
threat
last
week
to
expel
nine
Britons
from
Moscow
Whitehall
sources
last
night
disclosed
that
the
secret
list
including
details
of
the
Russians
names
addresses
contacts
and
areas
of
interest
and
which
was
passed
to
Ministers
played
a
crucial
role
in
defusing
the
diplomatic
row
triggered
when
the
Russians
found
a
British
spy
radioing
his
controller
in
London
It
was
made
unmistakably
clear
that
the
Russians
faced
a
possible
tit-for-tat
round
of
expulsions
in
which
their
interests
stood
to
be
damaged
much
more
than
ours
one
source
said
They
were
made
aware
that
our
intelligence
on
Russian
espionage
in
Britain
is
of
high
quality
In
a
booklet
published
last
month
M15
revealed
that
after
a
reduction
in
activity
following
the
end
of
the
Cold
War
the
Russian
SVR
the
successor
to
the
KGB
had
renewed
its
efforts
to
post
intelligence
officers
to
London
Moreover
the
military
intelligence
GRU
which
has
remained
largely
untouched
by
the
changes
of
the
past
five
years
has
maintained
roughly
the
same
presence
in
Britain
throughout
It
is
understood
that
the
number
of
SVR
officers
in
Britain
is
now
as
great
or
even
greater
than
in
the
Brezhnev
era
Sources
will
not
be
drawn
on
the
precise
level
of
the
threat
Some
of
the
Russians
on
last
week's
list
are
using
the
classic
spy's
cover
of
embassy
status
However
the
fall
of
Communism
has
made
it
much
easier
for
Russians
to
enter
Britain
in
a
variety
of
academic
business
and
even
touristic
guises
and
to
move
about
in
the
country
much
more
freely
Some
of
the

active
intelligence
operatives

THE
FIRST
rumblings
of
discontent
are
being
heard
over
a
film
about
IRA
humger
striker
Bobby
Sands
which
receives
its
premiere
today
at
the
Cannes
Film
Festival
Some
Mother's

has
been
made
by
a
director
who
has
himself
been
in
jail
for
terrorist
offences
and
will
upset
both
the
political
establishment
and
parts
of
the
Irish
republican
movement
The
film
which
stars
John
Lynch
as
Sands
who
died
in
the
Maze
prison
during
the
hunger
strike
will
inevitably
be
the
festival's
most
politically
controversial
film

cruel
and
unbending
and
suggests
Mrs

prisoners
deserved
to
die
Sands's
sister
Marcella
has
expressed
concern
about
the
film
and
some
of
the
families
of
the
other
dead
hunger-strikers
have
said
it
exploits
a
tragedy
for
financial
gain
We
deliberately
did
not
seek
the
approval
of
the
families
said
George
who
agreed
some
nationalists
questioned
whether
the
sacrifice
was
worthwhile
The
point
of
the
hunger
strike
is
still
a
very
painful
and
perhaps
unanswered
question
Some
Mother's
Son
mixes
fact
and
fiction
but
the
filmmakers
say
it
is
historically
accurate
Sands's
story
is
based
on
what
happened
to
him
but
the
portrayals
of
other
prisoners
in
the
H-Block
where
he
was
a
commander
are
composites
So
too
are
the
two
mothers
one
played
by
Helen
Mirren
as
a
middle-class
widow

is
shaken

of

I
have
been
in
over
seventy-three
films
in
thirty
years
and
by
the
time
you
read
this
it
will
probably
be
seventy-six
People
often
criticise
me
for
not
being
discriminating
enough
and
even
for
working
so
hard
Why
bother
As
far
as
discrimination
is
concerned
I
have
a
definite
standard
by
which
I
choose
films
I
choose
the
best
one
available
at
the
time
I
need
one
Of
course
this
has
often
led
me
down
dubious
artistic
paths
but
even
they
are
not
without
their
advantages
It
is
much
more
difficult
to
act
well
in
a
bad
film
with
a
bad
director
than
in
any
other
type
of
movie
and
it
gives
you
great
experience
in
taking
care
of
yourself
It
also
means
that
when
a
good
script
does
turn
up
you're
ready
for
it
It's
not
unlike
athletes
in
training
who
will
practise
running
on
sand
so
they
find
it
easy
to
run
on
a
solid
track
in
competition
Plus
of
course
there's
the
money
You
get
paid
the
same
for
a
bad
film
as
you
do
for
a
good
one-
because
no
one
knows
for
sure
if
the
bad
film
is
going
to
be
bad
or
the
good
film
is
going
to
be
good
until
the
premiere
You
can
wind
up
as
I
do
when
a
good
role
comes
along
absolutely
prepared
having
worked
right
up
to
date
or
you
can
sit
there
waiting
for
it
for
five
years
scared
I
of
course
don't
have
the
constraints
of
the
great
male
Hollywood
stars
who
will
not
play
certain
roles
for
fear
of
causing
a
lack
of
sympathy
or
letting
down
their
fans
I
cannot
imagine
a
Robert
Redford
Paul
Newman
or
Clint
Eastwood
playing
a
transvestite
killer
as
I
did
in
Dressed
to
Kill
or
an
overt
homosexual
as
I
did
in
Deathtrap
The
main
advantage
that
a
foreign
actor
has
in
Hollywood
is
to
play
the
flawed
characters
that
the
American
stars
don't
want
The

I
had
now
settled
into
a
period
where
I
had
no
social
life
at
all
but
just
went
from
one
film
to
another
always
with
the
best
of
intentions
but
mainly
with
that
intense
overriding
desire
to
make
a
lot
of
money
before
it
all
came
to
an
end
which
I
expected
it
to
do
on
an
almost
weekly
basis
The
moment
that
I
finished
Deadfall
in
the
studio
in
London
I
was
on
a
plane
back
to
Spain
to
start
another
film
a
Harry
Saltzman
production
a
war
film
called
Play
Dirty
It
was
to
be
directed
by
the
great
French
director
Ren
Clement
The
script
was
reasonable
and
it
had
a
good
plot
a
group
of
Israeli
commandos
are
sent
out
in
the
desert
war
to
blow
up
the
German
fuel
dumps
but
the
British
Army
have
got
there
first
and
they
want
the
fuel
for
themselves
The
Israelis
are
on
radio
silence
so
the
British
inform
the
Germans
that
they
are
coming
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
destroying
the
fuel
On
the
surface
it
is
a
good
action
story
based
on
fact
with
a
moral
to
it
and
some
controversy
So
what
could
possibly
go
wrong
The
short
answer
is
everything
Play
Dirty
is
a
prime
example
of
how
you
can
start
out
with
a
good
story
and
the
very
best
of
intentions
and
yet
get
gradually
worn
down
into
mediocrity
The
moment
that
I
signed
to
do
the
film
Ren
Clment
had
a
row
with
Harry
and
left
the
film
There
was
a
much-vaunted
re-write
of
the
script
which
in
my
opinion
was
not
as
good
as
the
original
but
we
used
it
anyway
The
powers
that
be
always
use
the
last
script
in
film-making
no
matter
how
bad
it
is
because
they
have
to
justify
the
additional
expense
to
their
financiers
and
dare
not
admit
they
have
made
a
mistake
Ren
Clment
was
replaced
by
Andr
de
Toth
with
whom
I
had
worked
briefly
when
young
in
A
Foxhole
in
Cairo
Andr
came
on
to
the
picture
so
late
that
even
he
had
no
time
to
do
his
best
work
Once
again
I
wound
up
in
a
film
where
the
backstage
action
so
to
speak
was
rather
more
interesting
than
the
film
itself
but
even
that
started
off
badly
Play
Dirty
was
due
to
be
shot
in
a
town
called
Almeria
in
southern
Spain
and
as
there
was
no
airport
there
I
had
to
fly
to
Madrid
and
then
take
a
train
This
did
not
worry
me
unduly
as
I
had
visions
of
a
very
pleasant
trip
through
the
Spanish
countryside
in
the
comfort
of
a
first-class
carriage
The
train
however
turned
out
to
be
a
very
ramshackle
affair
with
no
first-class
compartments
only
wooden
seats
and
no
dining
car
I
was
travelling
with
Johnny
Morris
my
stand-in
and
companion
and
our
first
worry
was
food
We
had
been
told
that
the
journey
took
eight
hours
but
no
one
had
warned
us
that
there
would
be
no
food
available
The
train
itself
was
excruciatingly
slow
and
as
a
journey
into
the
truly
futile
we
went
the
scenic
route
at
night!
Our
trip
finally
terminated
at
Almeria
and
we
hailed
a
cab
to
the
hotel
only
to
receive
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
A
policeman
stopped
our
vehicle
and
we
sat
and
waited
After
about
five
minutes
I
enquired
what
the
hold-up
was
Generalissimo
Franco
was
coming
it
appeared
and
all
roads
were
to
be
closed
Franco
was
the
Fascist
Dictator
of
Spain
at
the
time
We
sat
there
for
two
hours
in
a
temperature
of
ninety
degrees
with
no
air
conditioning
and
sweated
away
what
little
liquid
there
was
left
in
our
dry
frames
after
a
nightlong
bout
with
diarrhoea
after
buying
dodgy
snacks
Finally
Franco
came
zooming
past
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
we
were
allowed
on
our
way
As
we
passed
the
policeman
I
asked
him
what
Franco
was
doing
down
here
He
is
opening
the
new
Almeria
airport
he
said
with
pride
Once
in
our
rooms
which
though
a
little
spartan
were
very
comfortable
and
clean
with
a
nice
view
of
the
town
we
unpacked
showered
and
descended
to
the
lobby
to
find
the
action
but
there
was
none
Almeria
at
this
time
was
the
centre
of
Italian
Spaghetti
Western
film-making
since
it
had
been
discovered
by
Sergio
Leone
for
his
The
Good
the
Bad
and
the
Ugly
series
It
had
also
been
acquired
by
the
desert-war
film
group
such
as
ourselves
when
David
Lean
had
shot
the
train-crash
sequence
in
Lawrence
of
Arabia
here
What
nobody
had
told
us
was
that
there
were
only
four
sand-dunes
and
if
you
did
a
high
crane
shot
you
had
an
almost
immediate
picture
of
the
sea
with
the
crowded
beaches
of
the
town
of
Almeria
We
knew
there
were
at
least
two
Spaghetti
Westerns
being
made
there
currently
plus
Sean
Connery
was
also
filming
a
western
called
Shalako
Despite
all
this
activity
it
was
now
just
after
lunch
and
everybody
was
obviously
still
out
working
so
the
huge
lobby
of
the
hotel
was
empty
Johnny
and
I
ordered
a
couple
of
ice-cold
beers
and
took
them
into
a
shady
corner
and
sat
and
had
a
chat
Or
to
put
it
another
way
I
sat
and
bemoaned
the
fact
for
half
an
hour
that
there
were
no
women
around
and
I
was
here
for
twelve
long
weeks
Johnny
was
happily
married
and
not
a
great
source
of
sympathy
as
is
the
way
of
married
men
faced
with
the
enforced
celibacy
of
bachelors
As
I
was
droning
on
about
my
fate
three
shadows
fell
across
our
table
We
looked
up
and
I
thought
I
must
be
dreaming
Smiling
down
at
us
in
her
most
seductive
manner
was
Brigitte
Bardot
and
standing
on
either
side
of
her
were
two
other
women
almost
as
attractive
Allo
Makell
We
ave
bin
wetting
fur
yeww
This
last
word
pursed
her
already
famous
and
naturally
pouting
lips
into
an
even
deeper
moue
and
my
eyes
became
hypnotically
fixed
on
them
as
I
rose
to
my
feet
knocking
over
the
coffee
table
on
which
our
two
beers
stood
in
a
vain
attempt
to
muster
an
immediate
air
of
worldly
sophistication
and
savoir
faire
Everyone
laughed
at
this
silly
misfortune
except
myself
as
I
felt
my
face
burning
with
humiliation
Don't
worry
about
zat
said
Brigitte
airily
I
ave
a
car
outside
and
we
will
all
go
to
my
otel
fur
a
drink
Johnny
and
I
followed
this
little
group
across
the
vast
lobby
both
of
us
struck
dumb
by
what
was
happening
as
we
weaved
our
way
through
a
sea
of
empty
chairs
like
rats
following
the
Pied
Piper
I
still
had
not
spoken
and
was
not
yet
prepared
to
try
I
just
could
not
believe
that
this
was
happening
to
us
Not
only
was
my
speech
affected
but
my
walking
started
to
go
awry
I
found
myself
suddenly
swinging
my
left
arm
forward
in
time
with
my
left
leg
and
the
same
with
the
right
I
hadn't
even
done
this
when
I
was
learning
to
march
in
the
army
As
we
walked
Brigitte
introduced
us
to
her
two
friends
The
tall
dark
one
was
her
Venezuelan
secretary
Gloria
and
the
smaller
fair-haired
one
was
her
French
stand-in
Monique
As
a
trio
she
then
informed
us
they
were
known
as
Bri
Bri
Mo
Mo
and
Glo
Glo
Outside
the
hotel
we
got
into
her
white
Rolls
Royce
which
was
driven
by
a
black
chauffeur
Obviously
not
a
girl
to
do
things
by
halves
I
thought
correctly
as
it
turned
out
The
first
question
that
I
managed
to
blurt
out
of
a
clogged
throat
as
we
glided
quietly
along
the
coast
road
to
her
beach-side
hotel
was
How
did
you
know
that
we
were
coming
today
Sean
told
me
she
replied
It
was
then
I
remembered
that
she
was
starring
opposite
Sean
Connery
in
Shalako
On
our
arrival
at
the
hotel
we
were
taken
straight
up
to
her
suite
overlooking
the
sea
and
plied
with
drinks
and
room
service
I
sat
there
trying
to
keep
up
my
end
of
the
conversation
as
best
as
one
can
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
breakdown
My
mind
was
racing
What
was
going
on
Could
it
be
that
Brigitte
Bardot
actually
fancied
me
Could
I
be
that
lucky
The
answer
was
unfortunately
no
It
was
her
secretary
Gloria
who
fancied
me
and
Bardot
was
setting
it
up
for
her
I
was
disappointed
to
say
the
least
for
although
Gloria
was
gorgeous
I
had
this
intuition
that
here
was
the
sort
of
girl
who
having
given
herself
would
be
hard
to
persuade
to
take
herself
back
So
I
resisted
all
advances
on
this
front
and
was
also
a
little
incensed
by
a
feeling
of
snobbery
rare
for
me
that
I
had
been
sent
for
by
Brigitte
to
screw
her
staff
I
hung
around
all
during
the
shooting
of
the
picture
in
the
hope
that
Bardot
would
change
her
mind
but
I
soon
found
out
that
her
taste
ran
to
extremely
beautiful
dark
Spanish
boys
who
all
seemed
to
be
in
their
late
teens
I
never
heard
any
of
them
speak
to
anybody
including
her
they
just
used
to
frolic
behind
her
like
energetic
little
puppies
with
their
barks
removed
Try
as
I
might
and
I
did
I
could
not
squeeze
myself
into
this
category
So
I
gave
up
all
together
and
retired
from
her
sphere
of
influence
which
was
quite
wide
down
there
The
last
time
I
ever
saw
Bardot
was
at
the
party
for
the
end
of
Shalako
I
was
invited
by
Sean
but
sat
deliberately
out
of
the
limelight
with
my
friend
the
English
comedian
Eric
Sykes
who
was
also
in
the
picture
When
Bardot
came
in
Eric
started
to
make
me
laugh
She
is
in
love
with
me
he
whispered
and
she
can't
stand
it
Watch
her
as
she
goes
by
he
hissed
as
she
approached
our
table
She'll
pretend
and
just
ignore
me
which
is
what
she
did
She
walked
straight
past
without
even
looking
at
us
I
told
you
he
said
excitedly
She's
trying
to
fight
it-
she's
ignored
me
since
the
first
day
of
shooting
By
now
I
was
in
hysterics
and
Bardot
noticed
this
and
probably
thought
I
was
laughing
at
her
I
went
back
to
my
conversation
with
Eric
and
we
were
just
deciding
to
leave
when
a
stale
Spanish
loaf
hit
me
on
the
side
of
the
head
I
looked
up
and
Bardot
was
grinning
as
she
dusted
breadcrumbs
from
her
hands
I
smiled
through
the
pain
in
my
head
and
left
flicking
crumbs
off
my
shoulder
That
was
the
end
of
our
relationship

Back
in
England
Living
in
the
depths
of
the
Argentine
I
had
not
realised
the
full
effects
of
the
depression
which
had
really
begun
to
bite
by
But
on
my
passage
back
to
London
I
soon
found
out
The
ship
was
the
Harpathiani
of
about
tons
on
which
I
had
a
passage
for
l0s
p
a
day
all
found
and
to
feed
with
the
officers
I
shared
a
cabin
with
another
refugee
from
the
Argentine
The
crew
with
the
exception
of
three
Greek
firemen
were
all
certificated
officers
or
engineers
unable
to
get
a
ship
The
wireless
operator
forbidden
to
send
a
message
for
economy
reasons
told
me
that
the
only
communication
he
received
on
the
voyage
was
one
cutting
his
monthly
pay
from
l0s
to
and
he
was
married
with
three
children
Most
of
these
men
found
their
skills
were
needed
in
the
war
a
few
years
later
and
paid
dearly
for
them
in
life
and
injury
But
they
were
pretty
depressed
at
the
time
with
no
assurance
that
they
would
get
another
ship
when
they
were
signed
off
after
this
trip
We
played
poker
for
matches
no
one
had
any
money
from
Buenos
Aires
to
Rotterdam
and
there
was
plenty
of
acrimony
over
this
The
crew
ran
a
bridge
school
and
thought
themselves
to
be
definitely
superior
to
the
officers
which
they
probably
were
in
education
There
was
no
refrigeration
and
once
the
ice
box
ran
out
we
were
on
salt
pork
and
beef
ship's
biscuits
and
dried
vegetables
This
meant
that
we
were
made
to
drink
Board
of
Trade
lime
juice
every
day
to
ward
off
scurvy
This
entailed
lining
up
on
deck
under
the
eye
of
the
First
Mate
It
was
completely
unsweetened
and
I
still
get
a
dry
sensation
of
the
mouth
when
I
think
of
it
Having
once
had
scurvy
I
did
not
complain
On
reaching
home
in
I
found
the
slump
had
really
taken
root
There
were
about
unemployed
and
farming
was
in
the
depths
of
the
inter-war
Depression
However
the
news
from
New
Zealand
was
that
things
there
were
even
worse
with
the
prices
still
just
about
half
what
they
were
in
England
at
the
time
Nevertheless
the
farming
depression
needs
some
qualification
Those
farmers
who
suffered
most
were
in
the
arable
districts
of
eastern
and
southern
England
Again
they
were
in
the
main
those
who
had
gone
into
farming
since
the
war
and
who
had
seen
their
capital
quartered
in
the
last
decade
If
they
had
been
using
their
own
money
they
were
not
too
badly
off
except
that
they
were
practically
insolvent
Those
unfortunates
who
had
borrowed
to
get
established
were
in
a
very
bad
way
For
example
a
man
who
had
purchased
a
herd
of
cows
in
for
a
head
would
find
that
they
were
worth
no
more
than
a
head
by
Almost
every
other
farming
asset
had
depreciated
in
the
same
way
The
reason
why
the
arable
farmers
suffered
most
was
that
grain
prices
collapsed
almost
completely
and
the
cycle
of
arable
farming
is
unlike
dairying
a
long
one
lasting
at
least
a
year
or
months
Even
when
milk
prices
were
bad
they
brought
in
a
cheque
every
month
as
long
as
the
cows
were
milked
The
arable
farms
which
survived
the
Depression
were
those
which
had
the
facilities
for
dairying
a
hen
unit
or
pigs
I
should
be
more
specific
about
this
The
arable
farms
which
really
suffered
were
those
on
poor
land
away
from
the
sugar-beet
factories
which
had
been
set
up
in
the
s
and
which
were
unsuitable
for
growing
potatoes
and
other
higher
value
crops
The
derelict
land
to
be
seen
in
many
parts
of
the
south
was
the
result
of
these
conditions
and
much
of
it
remained
untouched
until
the
war
broke
out
in
But
little
of
it
was
really
good
land
of
natural
fertility
Even
in
the
depths
of
the
slump
it
was
not
easy
to
buy
what
one
would
call
a
good
farm
the
owners
or
tenants
of
these
managed
to
carry
on
somehow
My
own
prospects
at
the
time
were
not
particularly
good
I
still
had
the
I
had
started
out
with
and
about
besides
which
I
had
managed
to
save
in
the
last
four
years
by
the
exercise
of
incredible
meanness
My
father
offered
to
lend
me
more
when
I
decided
I
should
make
a
start
and
advised
me
to
get
some
more
experience
while
I
was
looking
round
I
certainly
needed
the
experience
My
skills
of
shepherding
and
looking
after
cattle
on
the
New
Zealand
and
Argentine
pattern
were
hardly
suited
to
the
small
farms
and
careful
husbandry
of
England
The
one
essential
thing
I
had
learnt
in
my
travels
which
stood
me
in
good
stead
in
later
years
was
that
success
in
farming
lies
in
knowing
not
so
much
what
to
do
to
get
the
right
results
but
rather
how
little
one
could
do
and
still
get
away
with
it
In
many
ways
this
is
a
negative
approach
But
in
hard
times
it
is
often
the
only
way
to
safety
The
trouble
is
that
once
learnt
it
is
impossible
to
forget
and
I
have
drilled
the
need
for
this
attitude
into
my
sons
so
well
that
one
of
them
accused
me
the
other
day
of
having
brought
him
up
to
be
too
mean
I
had
been
impressed
perhaps
overimpressed
by
Farmer's
Glory
in
which
the
author
had
succeeded
in
overcoming
the
slump
by
milking
his
cows
in
an
open-air
shed
on
the
downlands
of
Wiltshire
The
system
he
used
had
been
invented
by
Arthur
Hosier
who
farmed
on
the
Downs
above
the
Pewsey
Vale
Its
method
was
as
follows
Instead
of
having
good
cows
in
rich
meadows
tied
by
the
neck
in
stalls
for
most
of
the
winter
and
milked
by
hand
Hosier's
way
was
to
milk
large
numbers
of
very
cheap
Irish
heifers
on
poor
downland
feeding
them
with
grass
hay
and
cheap
imported
feeding
stuffs
After
a
few
years
of
this
sort
of
farming
the
pastures
improved
from
the
manure
and
treading
and
the
consequent
increase
in
fertility
allowed
for
heavier
and
heavier
stocking
Hosier
found
that
by
this
means
he
could
cheapen
his
costs
and
thrive
at
a
time
when
many
dairy
farmers
on
better
land
were
having
a
hard
time
The
Irish
heifers
mainly
from
the
poor
hills
of
County
Cork
improved
out
of
all
knowledge
After
two
or
three
years
they
grew
much
bigger
and
it
became
the
usual
practice
to
sell
them
after
three
calves
to
be
kept
on
the
more
traditional
dairy
lands
This
system
avoided
the
perils
of
depreciation
to
some
extent
herds
were
always
kept
young
and
the
farmers
were
not
forced
to
rear
their
own
replacements
Hosier
who
was
a
most
practical
inventive
genius
produced
many
other
implements
and
ideas
to
foster
dairying
in
the
Depression
and
established
a
factory
on
his
own
farm
for
making
them
Many
of
his
outdoor
bails
as
they
were
called
were
used
on
suitable
land
and
today
there
are
still
some
to
be
seen
in
Wiltshire
However
the
system
was
still
looked
down
on
by
the
traditional
dairy
farmers
especially
those
on
heavy
wet
land
where
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
winter
the
cattle
out
of
doors
This
was
not
because
they
would
have
come
to
any
harm
in
bad
weather
all
farm
animals
are
well
insulated
but
because
the
pastures
would
have
been
destroyed
by
their
hooves
My
old
mentor
P
G
Holder
had
asked
me
to
go
and
see
him
on
my
return
I
found
that
he
had
now
directed
his
enthusiasm
to
large-scale
dairying
and
was
planning
to
erect
a
cowshed
for
cows
would
I
go
into
partnership
with
him
My
parents
thought
this
a
good
idea
just
the
thing
for
a
young
man
to
be
associated
with
a
rich
and
established
one
I
didn't
see
it
that
way
at
all
Unless
I
told
him
he
would
be
prepared
to
give
me
control
of
the
set-up
I
would
sooner
go
off
on
my
own
This
wasn't
at
all
to
his
liking
The
pleasure
he
obtained
from
his
various
schemes
was
from
their
planning
and
initiation
he
just
hadn't
a
clue
or
any
interest
in
running
a
business
methodically
He
knew
at
once
that
his
enthusiasms
which
I
was
sure
would
be
recurrent
would
be
effectively
blocked
by
me
if
I
had
the
sort
of
control
I
wanted
We
decided
it
would
not
work
but
there
and
then
he
offered
to
back
me
in
any
venture
I
wanted
to
undertake
I
never
took
him
up
on
this
but
it
was
a
great
boost
to
my
morale
I
did
agree
however
to
help
him
set
up
the
new
dairy
herd
and
spent
nine
months
learning
all
about
cows
in
the
mass
at
his
expense
The
cowshed
at
Peaton
Hall
near
Ludlow
was
one
of
the
wonders
of
British
farming
in
those
days
It
was
built
to
the
latest
patterns
by
a
number
of
contractors
and
suppliers
whom
Holder
had
managed
to
bulldoze
into
giving
him
very
favourable
terms
indeed
There
were
certainly
problems
He
was
buying
the
cows
from
Ireland
and
every
week
there
was
a
message
from
the
station
at
Craven
Arms
saying
there
was
a
truck
of
cows
to
be
cleared
These
had
to
be
walked
home
and
usually
one
or
two
had
calved
on
the
way
The
building
however
was
not
progressing
as
fast
as
the
cows
were
coming
in
and
so
all
sorts
of
compromises
had
to
be
evolved
to
get
them
milked
in
relays
in
the
few
finished
stalls
None
of
the
men
and
there
were
a
great
many
were
skilled
dairymen
They
could
milk
but
had
no
idea
of
how
to
use
the
machines
or
keep
them
clean
It
was
a
continuing
nightmare
or
challenge
depending
how
you
looked
at
it
Every
time
some
sort
of
system
was
established
P.G
would
produce
another
cows
or
the
plans
for
yet
another
larger
cowshed
and
start
ordering
the
equipment
for
it
The
eventual
total
came
to
well
over
cows
However
by
the
late
spring
I
was
saved
from
too
deep
an
involvement
by
a
recurrence
of
malaria
and
by
my
insistence
that
as
I
was
looking
for
a
farm
of
my
own
he
really
should
get
someone
else
to
look
after
the
cows
He
immediately
offered
me
the
tenancy
of
one
of
the
farms
he
owned
quite
a
good
farm
on
heavy
land
The
main
difficulty
was
that
it
was
within
a
few
miles
of
Peaton
Hall
and
I
knew
full
well
that
I
would
be
pressed
into
managing
the
cows
whenever
as
frequently
happened
he
sacked
his
head
man
He
would
never
sack
me
I
was
also
obsessed
with
the
Hosier
system
and
the
attractions
of
cheap
land
on
the
Wiltshire
Downs
and
had
spent
any
spare
time
that
I
had
looking
for
farms
to
rent
there
On
reflection
I
was
probably
mistaken
in
this
I
have
always
been
keen
to
take
on
land
by
price
and
not
by
its
intrinsic
quality
the
result
has
been
that
I
have
never
farmed
a
decent
bit
of
dirt
in
years
I
could
have
taken
a
farm
with
good
land
when
I
started
for
very
little
more
money
than
the
bad
or
second-rate
Finding
a
farm
to
rent
was
not
too
easy
My
manner
with
the
landlords
or
their
agents
was
far
from
being
ideal
I
knew
little
about
English
farming
had
very
little
money
and
I
was
rather
young
trying
to
get
into
a
farm
when
many
older
and
more
experienced
farmers
sons
were
trying
to
get
into
banks
and
other
safe
city
jobs
Most
landlords
very
reasonably
would
much
sooner
let
their
farms
to
established
farmers
or
their
sons
than
to
complete
and
presumptuous
strangers
They
are
still
of
the
same
opinion
today
I
motored
thousands
of
miles
looking
for
a
farm
and
generally
found
that
they
were
becoming
vacant
because
the
farmers
had
found
the
going
tough
The
buildings
were
falling
down
the
fences
were
useless
and
the
arable
land
if
there
was
any
was
full
of
weeds
In
many
cases
the
crops
I
saw
were
hardly
worth
harvesting
Still
people
were
taking
land
Hosier
accumulated
thousands
of
acres
in
this
period
as
did
a
number
of
others
It
did
seem
that
under
his
system
all
that
was
needed
was
dry
land
water
and
strands
of
barbed
wire
to
contain
the
cows
and
eventually
you
could
build
up
a
farm
I
used
to
tell
Holder
that
I
could
rent
land
in
Wiltshire
for
a
quarter
of
the
reduced
rent
he
wanted
to
ask
me
He
used
to
laugh
and
said
that
if
I
settled
in
those
benighted
parts
he
would
never
come
and
see
me
He
never
did
Eventually
I
happened
on
Manor
Farm
West
Knoyle
about
acres
which
had
failed
to
find
a
buyer
at
auction
It
was
owned
by
one
of
the
successful
Wiltshire
farmers
and
had
been
occupied
by
his
brother
who
had
given
up
I
approached
Tom
Coles
the
owner
and
offered
to
rent
it
The
rent
was
fixed
at
a
year
about
s
p
an
acre
which
was
considered
a
high
rent
for
those
days
It
had
a
seven
bedroomed
house
with
few
conveniences
four
good
cottages
and
the
usual
buildings
The
land
was
about
two-thirds
light
chalk
and
the
rest
heavy
clay
Being
right
on
the
western
edge
of
Salisbury
Plain
it
had
a
steep
road
right
up
through
the
farm
This
hill
I
was
told
was
the
farm's
worst
drawback
because
at
least
three
horses
were
needed
to
pull
a
ton
up
it
My
taking
this
farm
had
caused
quite
a
stir
locally
I
discovered
later
Someone
else
was
trying
to
take
it
for
his
son
but
he
had
been
so
devious
in
his
machinations
that
when
I
had
come
on
the
scene
and
not
argued
about
the
rent
the
owner
had
closed
at
once
I
was
warned
though
as
soon
as
the
news
got
around
which
was
about
ten
minutes
after
the
deal
had
been
effected
that
it
was
the
worst
farm
in
the
district
that
no
one
had
ever
succeeded
there
and
that
I
was
doomed
to
failure
There
was
nearly
a
failure
of
another
sort
I
was
at
the
time
engaged
to
be
married
and
from
time
to
time
I
had
taken
Ronie
around
with
me
when
looking
for
a
farm
On
this
occasion
she
hadn't
been
with
me
on
my
first
inspection
but
came
with
both
our
mothers
when
I
clinched
the
deal
I
negotiated
in
the
car
with
the
landlord
while
Ronie
and
her
mentors
looked
round
the
house
When
they
came
out
I
asked
them
what
they
thought
of
it
I
had
seen
no
more
than
the
kitchen
myself
Impossible
said
both
mothers
it
won't
do
at
all
In
that
case
I
said
it
is
just
too
bad
I
have
just
taken
the
farm

Harassment
I
well
remember
the
day
when
I
first
stared
hard
malevolent
racism
in
the
face
I
believe
that
I
will
always
remember
it
even
though
it
was
quite
a
few
years
ago
and
even
though
it
has
recurred
quite
a
few
times
since
It
was
early
morning
and
I
went
down
to
answer
a
bang
on
the
front
door
of
Dad's
house
I
had
been
in
the
bathroom
and
was
in
my
dressing-gown
When
I
opened
the
door
three
white
men
stood
facing
me
I
have
never
experienced
any
racism
in
athletics
We
all
mix
well
together
support
each
other
treat
each
other
as
equals
By
and
large
black
athletes
receive
identical
treatment
to
everyone
else
Up
until
this
moment
of
opening
the
door
of
Dad's
house
and
looking
at
these
three
men
I
had
experienced
very
little
prejudice
in
life
either
I
had
heard
stories
including
horrendous
tales
of
harassment
by
the
police
from
other
people
in
the
black
community
but
my
family
and
I
had
so
far
escaped
such
treatment
There
had
been
a
recent
incident
involving
my
younger
brother
Russell
who
had
been
at
a
party
and
on
his
way
home
been
accosted
by
a
group
of
men
that
he
knew
who
were
in
a
car
They
offered
him
a
lift
home
He
refused
One
of
them
said
Come
on
Russell
are
you
a
man
or
a
boy
An
altercation
followed
and
Russell
punched
one
of
the
men
and
ran
off
That
was
the
story
that
Russell
later
told
Dad
Dad
was
awoken
by
a
telephone
call
about
an
hour
later
around
five-thirty
Mr
Christie
said
a
voice
you
don't
know
me
but
I
know
you
We
have
met
and
I
know
that
you
are
a
good
man
and
a
religious
man
I
am
therefore
sorry
to
tell
you
that
I
am
going
to
kill
your
son
Russell
Dad
said
nothing
He
was
too
stunned
I
offered
your
son
a
lift
home
this
morning
Mr
Christie
the
voice
went
on
and
he
refused
I
told
him
not
to
be
silly
and
then
he
stabbed
me
Your
son
stabbed
me
Mr
Christie
I
know
that
Russell
lives
in
your
basement
and
I
am
going
to
kill
him
I
stopped
the
police
banging
down
your
door
earlier
out
of
respect
to
you
Tell
Russell
to
give
himself
up
to
the
police
and
when
they
have
dealt
with
him
Mr
Christie
I
am
going
to
shoot
him
The
line
went
dead
Dad
went
down
to
see
if
my
brother
was
in
his
room
Russell
told
him
what
had
occurred
and
that
he
had
not
stabbed
the
man
but
only
punched
him
Dad
looked
out
of
his
bedroom
window
and
saw
a
strange
car
with
some
men
in
it
parked
outside
It
drove
round
the
corner
and
came
back
The
situation
was
clearly
serious
My
father
went
to
a
police
station
that
evening
after
work
to
report
the
threatening
telephone
call
and
the
fact
that
his
son
was
being
threatened
with
extreme
violence
He
spoke
to
the
officer
on
desk
duty
who
said
that
a
complaint
against
Russell
had
been
made
at
another
station
Dad
gave
particulars
of
his
own
complaint
The
duty
officer
promised
to
get
in
touch
but
nothing
happened
for
two
days
After
this
a
detective
saw
Dad
in
the
street
and
said
that
he
wanted
to
interview
Russell
My
father
said
that
he
would
bring
him
to
the
station
This
was
the
day
before
I
opened
the
door
to
the
three
men
I
looked
at
them
all
tough-looking
and
said
Hello
can
I
help
you
Is
your
Dad
in
one
of
the
men
asked
No
I
said
I
didn't
know
who
was
in
and
who
was
not
but
the
incident
with
Russell
and
the
telephone
call
had
made
the
whole
family
wary
Mr
Christie's
not
there
you're
saying
another
man
said
That's
right
I
said
James
Russell
Christie
then
the
man
said
I
didn't
know
if
Russell
was
there
or
not
He
is
a
volatile
character
far
more
so
than
me
and
he
came
and
went
as
he
pleased
I
said
No
By
now
I
was
extremely
suspicious
The
smallest
of
the
group
came
nearer
and
said
I
know
you
You're
James
Russell
Christie
No
I'm
not
I
said
I
was
grabbed
by
the
lapels
of
my
dressing
gown
and
pinned
against
the
wall
You're
James
Russell
Christie
he
said
I'm
sure
that
you're
James
Russell
Christie
Up
until
this
time
no
ID
card
or
warrant
had
been
produced
For
all
I
knew
these
could
have
been
the
men
behind
the
call
to
my
father
the
men
come
to
shoot
my
brother
One
of
the
men
then
gave
me
a
perfunctory
glance
at
a
warrant
before
entering
the
house
and
walking
up
the
stairs
I
began
to
grapple
with
the
man
who
was
holding
me
Anna
my
younger
sister
appeared
on
the
landing
and
screamed
Dad
heard
her
and
came
down
the
stairs
I
hadn't
known
that
he
was
in
because
normally
when
he
is
in
the
house
you
can
hear
him
singing
and
moving
around
This
particular
morning
because
his
car
had
broken
down
he
was
unable
to
take
Mum
to
work
and
he
had
decided
to
have
a
lie-in
He
saw
that
two
men
were
now
holding
me
pushing
me
down
and
punching
me
and
he
recognized
the
man
who
was
walking
up
the
stairs
So
he
said
to
him
this
is
the
way
that
the
police
go
about
their
business
You
come
down
here
to
see
me
and
you
beat
up
my
son
The
moment
they
realized
that
Dad
was
in
they
let
me
go
As
one
walked
outside
another
began
arguing
with
Dad
who
was
naturally
absolutely
furious
at
what
had
been
taking
place
Linford
Dad
said
has
absolutely
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
I
went
down
to
the
basement
to
see
if
Russell
was
there
He
was
with
a
friend
called
Tony
I
told
him
that
the
police
wanted
to
see
him
Then
we
heard
a
commotion
upstairs
There
had
been
a
lull
Suddenly
the
door
had
burst
open
and
twenty
or
thirty
policemen
rushed
into
the
house
and
began
to
punch
and
kick
my
father
It
was
obvious
that
they
had
been
outside
all
the
time
probably
in
a
van
They
had
blocked
the
street
off
rather
as
if
an
armed
siege
was
in
progress
Dad
is
one
of
the
quietest
mildest
men
you
could
meet
He
had
been
in
Britain
for
over
twenty
years
and
never
had
any
problem
or
contact
with
the
police
except
for
one
occasion
when
he
was
with
Mum
on
a
shopping
expedition
and
police
officers
approached
him
and
said
You
fit
the
description
of
a
guy
that
has
just
mugged
a
woman
down
the
road
Dad
had
submitted
to
turning
out
his
pockets
and
being
searched
before
they
let
him
go
On
another
occasion
he
had
been
struck
once
by
another
man
at
work
and
we
were
furious
at
him
for
not
returning
the
blow
I
leave
all
vengeance
to
God
Dad
had
said
and
now
here
he
was
nearing
sixty
years
of
age
being
attacked
in
fact
being
knocked
senseless
by
the
police
They
had
come
for
Russell
for
his
attack
on
the
man
in
the
car
Dad
had
complained
about
the
threatening
telephone
call
and
no
action
had
been
taken
but
the
man
had
obviously
reported
Russell
to
the
police
and
here
they
were
in
force
to
arrest
him
We
rushed
to
join
in
to
help
Dad
I
grabbed
a
chair
in
a
blind
panic
but
heard
Dad
call
out
telling
me
to
put
it
down
I
was
kicked
in
the
back
in
the
melee
We
were
all
being
punched
and
kicked
Dad
was
pushed
along
the
passage
into
the
kitchen
He
asked
why
they
were
constantly
hitting
him
when
he
was
not
retaliating
He
was
knocked
unconscious
When
he
came
round
they
dragged
him
outside
and
flung
him
in
his
night-clothes
into
a
car
and
handcuffed
him
I
was
dragged
down
the
hard
concrete
steps
on
to
the
pavement
A
policeman
kicked
my
testicles
hard
This
one's
for
Brixton
he
shouted
Brixton
and
the
riots
there
were
still
fresh
in
everyone's
mind
My
dressing
gown
was
ripped
I
was
flung
into
a
police
van
and
Russell
was
also
dragged
in
He
had
been
handcuffed
and
was
crying
with
the
pain
shouting
that
they
were
too
tight
They
tried
to
loosen
them
but
failed
Blood
began
to
seep
from
his
hands
The
policeman
who
had
kicked
me
in
the
groin
began
to
slap
Russell
around
the
head
When
I
told
him
to
stop
he
laughed
We
were
taken
to
the
station
dragged
down
to
the
cells
and
left
there
all
of
us
Dad
Russell
his
friend
Tony
and
me
Anna
had
also
been
arrested
in
her
nightclothes
and
taken
to
the
station
I
was
barefoot
and
cold
all
I
had
on
were
my
underpants
and
my
dressing
gown
which
by
this
time
was
just
ripped
to
shreds
I
sat
there
battered
and
bruised
very
angry
and
not
a
little
frightened
It
was
the
first
time
that
I
had
ever
seen
the
inside
of
a
police
cell
We
were
in
there
for
eight
or
nine
hours
but
it
seemed
like
days
We
felt
so
helpless
so
powerless
to
right
what
to
us
was
a
terrible
wrong
Eventually
we
were
taken
up
out
of
the
cells
and
charged
I
was
charged
with
three
different
offences
assault
criminal
damage
and
possessing
an
offensive
weapon
Once
the
police
have
arrested
you
or
so
it
seemed
to
us
they
will
throw
the
book
at
you
in
order
to
make
something
stick
They
said
that
I
had
torn
a
policeman's
tunic
They
said
that
in
the
narrow
passageway
a
corridor
whose
opposite
walls
I
can
touch
comfortably
with
two
hands
I
had
picked
up
an
aluminium
chair
ripped
it
in
half
swung
it
around
and
hit
a
policeman
with
it
so
hard
that
he
had
to
shield
his
head
But
he
had
no
injuries
that
I
could
see
They
charged
Dad
with
obstructing
the
police
and
claimed
that
all
our
injuries
had
been
sustained
in
the
struggle
After
we
left
the
police
station
we
all
had
to
go
to
hospital
we
were
off
work
for
weeks
In
the
great
fracas
in
our
house
between
the
three
of
us
and
the
twenty
or
thirty
policemen
it
was
our
family
who
were
charged
with
assault
We
attempted
to
have
the
case
tried
in
a
Crown
Court
with
a
judge
and
jury
but
it
seemed
apparent
to
us
at
our
first
appearance
at
the
Magistrates
Court
that
every
attempt
was
made
including
the
dropping
of
a
crucial
charge
to
keep
the
case
at
that
level
My
solicitor
was
pessimistic
If
you
are
found
guilty
he
told
me
they
are
going
to
put
you
away
It
was
a
horrifying
time
a
nightmare
the
future
bleak
and
uncertain
So
the
stories
are
true
we
told
ourselves
there
are
two
types
of
justice
in
Britain
one
for
whites
and
one
for
blacks
Instances
of
police
racial
harassment
which
had
always
happened
to
other
people
were
now
happening
to
us
The
police
gave
evidence
One
officer
said
that
my
youngest
sister
who
eventually
grew
to
be
just
feet
inches
tall
but
who
was
still
at
school
at
this
time
had
her
arm
around
his
neck
trying
to
strangle
him
Another
said
that
Russell
had
pulled
a
brick
from
out
of
the
passage
wall
and
hit
him
with
it
It
was
impossible
that
anyone
could
have
torn
out
a
brick
through
the
wallpaper
Even
Geoff
Capes
could
not
have
managed
it
Despite
this
inevitably
I
suppose
we
were
found
guilty
on
all
charges
I
was
fined
I
found
that
amazing
I
was
charged
with
wilful
damage
and
assault
and
was
fined
just
equivalent
to
the
penalty
for
a
serious
speeding
offence
I
am
sure
they
thought
that
if
they
just
gave
us
a
token
punishment
then
the
whole
thing
would
all
be
forgotten
We
appealed
Again
it
was
a
Magistrates
Court
The
chair
I
had
supposedly
used
on
the
policeman
had
disappeared
obviously
thrown
away
The
police
said
that
they
hadn't
realized
that
they
had
to
keep
it
The
convictions
were
upheld
the
fines
stood
The
magistrate
said
that
though
he
acknowledged
that
Dad
was
a
peaceful
law-abiding
citizen
who
had
never
had
any
trouble
with
the
police
and
who
held
strong
religious
beliefs
there
were
nevertheless
times
when
people
do
get
angry
and
tell
lies
Though
they
could
pinpoint
no
inaccuracies
in
our
evidence
they
nevertheless
accepted
the
police's
version
of
events
The
extraordinary
irony
was
that
the
original
case
against
Russell
never
reached
fruition
This
my
first
encounter
with
real
racism
came
as
a
shock
In
my
heart
I
cannot
put
down
what
happened
to
our
family
that
day
to
anything
else
It
still
has
an
effect
on
me
it
is
still
painful
Every
time
I
think
about
it
talk
about
it
it
hurts
a
great
deal
Dad
mainly
through
his
strong
religious
convictions
has
forgiven
them
He
says
that
if
you
really
believe
in
God
you
have
to
forgive
But
I
cannot
To
me
it
was
both
an
ending
and
a
beginning
It
was
the
end
of
na
vet
and
the
beginning
of
a
hard
cynicism
especially
with
regard
to
the
police
We
were
totally
inexperienced
greenhorns
as
far
as
this
sort
of
experience
went
lost
souls
entrapped
in
a
web
of
intrigue
We
did
not
understand
the
law
we
did
not
understand
our
rights
But
it
was
only
the
beginning

THE
CUTTING
ROOM
FLOOR
Doing
Surprise
Surprise
is
a
lot
of
fun
but
it
makes
your
heart
go
a
bit
because
you
never
know
what
the
people
will
look
like
or
what
they'll
say
Rehearsals
are
a
bit
like
doing
a
show
by
braille
Sometimes
I
think
to
myself
What
am
I
rehearsing
this
for
It
could
turn
out
completely
different
Very
often
it
does
but
the
funny
thing
is
the
show
seems
to
work
because
it
has
that
exciting
ingredient
of
no-one
being
quite
in
charge
of
what's
going
on
Our
relationship
with
the
viewers
is
a
special
one
At
first
we
had
no
idea
of
the
impact
that
we
were
having
on
the
public
Then
one
evening
Christopher
Biggins
and
I
had
some
time
off
from
making
Surprise
Surprise
and
we
decided
to
go
and
see
Alan
Bennett's
play
Forty
Years
n
We
walked
into
the
theatre
and
everyone
in
the
foyer
scattered!
We
found
it
amazing
that
the
sight
of
the
two
of
us
together
should
make
people
so
nervous
Did
they
really
think
we
were
trying
to
set
them
up
for
the
programme
It
seemed
incredible
to
us
and
yet
had
I
thought
about
it
there
is
a
difference
between
the
people
who
make
up
the
studio
audience
and
write
in
for
tickets
and
actually
hope
we
will
have
a
surprise
for
them
and
the
others
who
don't
write
in
and
are
maybe
terrified
by
the
thought
of
appearing
on
the
show
I
know
that
some
people
have
good
reason
to
be
shy
Once
for
the
Cilla
programme
we
went
live
to
a
block
of
flats
where
we
had
the
camera
and
microphone
mounted
in
a
big
crane
I
said
Now
if
you
recognize
these
flats
as
being
where
you
live
come
to
the
balcony
and
give
us
a
wave
and
you'll
be
on
television
We
had
a
terrific
response
The
camera
lights
went
on
and
all
these
front
doors
opened
and
people
came
pouring
out
onto
the
balconies
The
crane
went
up
and
down
then
moved
in
close
to
film
people
outside
their
front
doors
and
then
I
interviewed
them
from
the
studio
This
went
on
for
a
while
then
I
saw
another
likely
couple
and
said
Right
We'll
go
in
there
As
the
camera
moved
towards
their
balcony
the
feller
broke
away
and
rushed
indoors
leaving
the
girl
outside
I
asked
her
if
she'd
been
watching
the
show
She
said
yes
so
I
said
Well
what's
going
on
with
him
What's
he
run
in
for
He
should
be
out
here
with
you
I
shouted
after
the
feller
and
coaxed
him
until
he
came
out
again
which
he
did
and
gave
the
camera
a
wave
There
was
a
younger
girl
on
the
balcony
as
well
so
I
said
Who's
this
She's
the
babysitter
came
the
reply
Why
have
a
babysitter
when
there
are
two
adults
watching
television
I
wondered
to
myself
It
later
turned
out
that
the
feller
was
having
an
affair
with
the
woman
and
her
husband
who
thought
his
wife
was
out
playing
bingo
was
sitting
in
a
pub
round
the
corner
watching
the
whole
thing
on
television!
It
led
to
a
divorce
and
I
was
a
little
sad
to
hear
that
but
people
bring
these
things
on
themselves
A
similar
scandal
blew
up
after
an
episode
of
Surprise
Surprise
A
feller
wrote
in
to
tell
us
about
his
fiance
and
what
a
marvellous
tapdancer
she
was
Could
we
surprise
her
with
a
phone-call
and
invite
her
on
the
show
Then
we
found
out
from
our
records
that
the
girl
had
written
in
during
the
previous
series
to
tell
us
about
her
fianc
saying
that
he
was
a
talented
singer
Could
I
phone
him
up
and
surprise
him
and
invite
him
on
the
show
We
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
link
the
two
items
together
So
I
phoned
up
the
girl
and
did
the
surprise
on
her
Where's
your
feller
I
asked
her
I
told
her
that
he'd
written
me
a
letter
about
her
and
that
they
were
both
going
to
be
on
the
show
Then
I
spoke
to
the
feller
and
explained
that
she'd
said
he
was
a
good
singer
Oh
he
said
I'll
bloody
well
kill
er
So
we
had
them
both
on
the
show
He
sang
nd
Street
dressed
in
top
hat
and
tails
and
she
did
some
tapdancing
and
it
made
a
lovely
piece
for
the
programme
As
extra
surprises
we
had
the
Roly
Polys
to
dance
for
us
and
Biggins
was
one
of
the
Roly
Polys
It
all
went
off
extremely
well
Two
days
later
I
saw
this
headline
in
the
paper
SURPRISE
SURPRISE
IT'S
MY
HUSBAND
I
read
on
and
found
that
this
guy
who
not
only
owed
his
wife
in
maintenance
had
gone
on
television
with
the
other
woman!
Some
people
do
leave
me
a
little
bit
flabbergasted
I
mean
did
he
really
think
he'd
get
away
with
it
unnoticed
on
a
programme
watched
by
fifteen
million
viewers
Even
if
his
own
wife
hadn't
seen
him
someone
else
who
knew
him
was
bound
to
It
did
strike
me
as
a
little
well
tactless
Not
that
we
can't
be
surprised
ourselves
On
the
Cilla
show
some
years
ago
I
was
knocking
on
doors
to
see
if
people
were
watching
the
show
and
I
ended
up
in
a
brothel
The
door
was
opened
by
a
woman
She
said
yes
she'd
been
watching
the
programme
with
her
friend
I
thought
she
looked
a
bit
rough
but
I
wasn't
very
quick
on
the
uptake
In
the
hallway
was
a
line
of
men
Still
it
didn't
click
I
just
thought
She's
got
a
lot
of
friends
Then
the
camera
lens
steamed
up!
In
those
days
it
was
still
fairly
rare
to
film
in
this
very
mobile
way
and
the
crew
hadn't
allowed
for
the
humidity
in
the
house
after
coming
in
from
outdoors
I
was
peering
through
this
cloudy
picture
from
the
studio
and
a
feller
came
up
on
the
screen
Who
are
you
I
asked
him
He
gave
me
a
name
and
I
said
Well
you've
gorrer
nice
tan
He
did
too
he
was
a
coloured
feller!
I
was
just
going
to
ask
him
where
he'd
been
on
holiday
when
I
realised
and
swallowed
the
question
After
the
programme
we
got
a
lot
of
stick
from
viewers
Of
all
the
streets
to
pick
Cilla
why
did
you
have
to
go
into
a
red-light
district
that
kind
of
thing
I
couldn't
really
say
why
we
picked
that
one
but
I
don't
mind
putting
some
of
the
blame
on
a
certain
football
club
The
reason
is
that
we
had
to
share
cameras
with
Match
of
the
Day
so
wherever
they
were
filming
we
were
restricted
to
that
area
of
the
country
Come
to
think
of
it
if
our
cameramen
had
stayed
in
that
house
much
longer
we'd
have
been
Match
of
the
Day!
So
much
for
the
gaffes
which
sometimes
slip
through
the
net
and
then
are
seen
by
millions
of
viewers
If
you
only
knew
how
many
other
items
we
cancel
or
have
to
edit
out
of
the
final
show
One
recent
non-starter
had
promised
to
be
one
of
the
most
romantic
items
we
had
ever
screened
A
boy
aged
twenty-one
we'll
call
him
Colin
wrote
to
tell
us
that
he
and
his
girlfriend
were
getting
engaged
at
Christmas-time
and
he
thought
it
would
be
a
lovely
surprise
if
he
could
propose
to
her
on
the
show
Nice
one
we
thought
Then
someone
in
the
team
suggested
that
Colin
should
make
a
date
with
his
girl
so
she'd
think
he
was
coming
to
take
her
out
On
the
Outside
Broadcasting
camera
we'd
have
Toni
Arthur
knocking
on
the
door
Came
the
day
and
Toni
knocked
on
the
door
The
girl
opened
it
saw
Toni
and
the
camera
crew
and
immediately
slammed
it
shut
Behind
the
door
we
could
hear
all
sorts
of
noises
swearing
and
other
kerfuffle
then
it
opened
again
This
time
Toni
managed
to
persuade
the
girl
to
come
to
the
studio
because
her
boyfriend
was
there
and
she
could
see
the
show
and
get
a
nice
surprise
We
had
a
white
Rolls-Royce
to
take
her
there
and
that
was
fine
She
came
on
the
show
and
I
said
to
her
Do
you
know
why
you're
here
She
said
No
I
said
Well
I'll
tell
you
But
first
of
all
can
we
have
some
soft
lights
and
romantic
music
The
band
started
to
play
something
gentle
with
lots
of
strings
Colin
was
sat
there
in
a
dinner
jacket
and
in
one
of
his
pockets
was
the
ring
we'd
bought
for
him
to
give
to
her
I
said
to
him
Right
Colin
Off
you
go
He
stood
up
and
walked
over
to
his
girl
got
down
on
one
knee
just
as
we'd
rehearsed
it
gave
her
the
ring
and
said
Will
you
That
was
as
far
as
he
got
because
she
interrupted
him
with
a
loud
No!
The
audience
roared
I
quickly
said
to
the
girl
Now
don't
worry
I
know
this
is
all
a
bit
daunting
and
embarrassing
I
can
quite
understand
that
But
really
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
home
or
in
some
more
suitable
setting
I'm
sure
you'd
say
yes
wouldn't
you
She
said
No!
Now
I
was
struggling
but
I
carried
on
I
explained
that
we
had
arranged
for
them
to
be
taken
out
in
the
white
Rolls-Royce
to
have
dinner
at
a
wonderful
Italian
restaurant
I'm
sure
I
said
that
when
you've
had
a
lovely
meal
and
you're
in
a
romantic
mood
and
he
asks
you
again
you'll
say
No!
she
said
just
as
firmly
as
before
I
was
more
than
a
bit
exasperated
by
all
this
non-cooperation
If
I'd
been
her
I'd
have
said
yes
just
to
get
off
the
set
Right
I
said
You
can
give
us
our
ring
back!
And
you're
not
going
out
to
dinner!
Afterwards
everyone
in
the
studio
agreed
that
we'd
have
to
cut
the
item
It
was
great
television
but
we
only
wanted
to
give
surprises
to
people
who
accepted
them
All
that
No
No
No
certainly
made
a
change
but
it
was
against
the
programme
policy
so
we
dropped
it
Later
we
had
an
angry
letter
from
of
all
people
Colin's
mum!
Why
had
we
cut
out
her
Colin
she
demanded
It
really
is
amazing
what
some
people
will
put
up
with
in
order
to
be
famous
for
five
minutes
Someone
thought
up
a
marvellous
piece
of
revenge
on
the
girlfriend
We'd
keep
the
item
going
as
a
continuation
piece
and
each
week
we'd
bring
a
different
feller
I'd
say
to
her
Will
this
one
do
She'd
say
No!
and
we'd
keep
it
going
until
she
gave
in
Everyone
on
the
show
thought
it
was
such
a
great
idea
we'd
better
keep
it
to
ourselves
So
we
never
did
anything
about
it
CUT!
Reunions
always
go
down
well
with
the
audience
and
some
of
the
scenes
are
really
quite
moving
I
am
fairly
hardened
to
it
now
but
in
the
first
two
series
Biggins
never
was
I
always
knew
if
a
story
had
a
good
emotional
pull
because
I'd
hear
Biggins
whimpering
off-camera
Our
researchers
came
up
with
a
promising
story
involving
a
man
in
his
seventies
who
hadn't
seen
his
daughter
since
she
was
one
year
old
Now
she
had
grandchildren
of
her
own
It
took
the
researchers
a
long
time
to
track
her
down
and
then
they
were
able
to
pass
on
the
good
news
to
the
old
man
That's
great
he
said
I'm
really
looking
forward
to
meeting
her
Right
we
said
We'll
fix
a
day
for
it
and
then
we'll
bring
you
along
to
the
studio
What
do
you
mean
studio
he
asked
For
the
filming
we
said
Oh
no
he
said
I'll
be
very
happy
to
meet
my
daughter
again
after
all
these
years
But
I'm
certainly
not
going
to
do
it
on
television!
CUT!
We
had
what
we
thought
was
a
lovely
item
about
a
fireman
who
had
done
voluntary
service
for
thirty-three
years
Not
only
that
he
had
raised
thousands
of
pounds
for
the
fire
service
charity
Of
all
the
many
rescues
he
had
taken
part
in
the
most
unusual
was
when
he
had
to
save
a
pig
and
give
it
the
kiss
of
life
The
pig
survived
so
did
the
fireman
and
now
we
had
him
and
the
pig's
grandson
in
the
studio
The
idea
was
to
ask
this
feller
to
show
us
how
he
brought
the
original
pig
back
to
life
but
just
when
he
was
about
to
start
the
kiss
of
life
we'd
say
That's
all
right
You
don't
have
to
blow
into
that
one
Blow
into
this
Then
we'd
hand
him
this
balloon
pig
which
we'd
had
made
to
order
for
We
never
got
that
far
The
grandson
pig
was
impossible
Elephants
you
can
train
camels
you
can
train
any
animal
fit
for
the
circus
can
be
trained
to
perform
in
front
of
an
audience
But
this
pig
was
terrified
and
couldn't
be
calmed
down
It
was
dragged
on
the
set
wearing
a
harness
and
squealing
blue
murder
Its
handler
had
assured
us
there'd
be
no
problem
He'll
be
fine
he
said
He's
been
in
shows
he
said
He's
used
to
seeing
a
lot
of
people
Unfortunately
the
pig
must
have
had
a
short
memory
because
he
made
such
a
noise
he
completely
destroyed
the
item
In
no
time
at
all
I
was
put
right
off
doing
it
and
even
if
we
had
gone
ahead
with
filming
we
could
never
have
shown
it
because
the
RSPCA
and
the
animal
rights
people
would
have
jumped
on
us
There
was
only
one
thing
for
it
CUT!
I
went
to
a
garage
to
do
a
request
item
a
bit
like
a
Cillagram
Right
I
said
does
anybody
have
a
message
they'd
like
to
send
cos
you're
on
the
telly
now
This
feller
came
forward
Extremely
camp
he
was
He
gazed
at
the
camera
all
misty
I
want
to
send
all
my
love
and
would
you
please
sing
You're
My
World
Fine
I
said
I'll
do
that
But
who's
it
for
He
looked
straight
at
the
camera
and
said
softly
but
intensely
He'll
know
who
it's
for
Do
you
know
we
couldn't
use
that
either
Too
passionate
for
us
and
besides
we're
a
family
show
CUT!

If
there
was
mutual
malice
between
us
and
the
locals
there
was
a
blood
vendetta
between
us
and
the
Provisionals
We
looked
on
it
as
a
battle
to
the
death
but
because
of
the
politicians
and
army
rules
and
regulations
we
were
fighting
with
one
hand
tied
behind
our
backs
Of
course
we're
human
and
when
we
thought
nobody
was
looking
we
untied
that
other
hand
and
played
it
just
as
dirty
as
the
Provisionals
A
lot
of
the
guys
carried
Belfast
Spares
You
go
out
on
patrol
with
your
self-loading
rifle
and
a
full
magazine
of
twenty
rounds
of
ammo
But
you
carry
a
single
spare
round
usually
in
the
breast
pocket
The
old
joke
was
that
in
a
Catholic/Protestant
holy
war
in
Ireland
you
carried
a
bullet
in
your
pocket
over
your
heart
so
if
anybody
fired
a
Bible
at
you
the
bullet
would
break
the
impact
and
save
your
life
It
might
be
late
at
night
on
a
dark
street
when
you
spot
some
Provisional
hard-line
terrorist
with
a
gun
or
even
some
teenage
errand-runner
carrying
a
weapon
between
Provo
safe
houses
Now
the
rules
say
that
you've
got
to
shout
out
a
challenge
to
the
gunman
and
give
him
a
warning
that
you're
a
soldier
That's
just
bullshit
The
very
least
that's
going
to
happen
is
the
guy's
gonna
get
away
if
he
doesn't
panic
And
then
a
few
night's
later
he's
gonna
see
you
before
you
see
him
and
you
or
one
of
your
mates
is
dead
Or
when
you
challenge
him
he's
gonna
turn
and
shoot
first
But
if
you've
got
the
insurance
of
a
spare
round
and
you're
sure
the
guy's
carrying
a
piece
you
get
to
shoot
first
And
then
you
start
a
few
seconds
of
screaming
and
challenging
And
you
fire
a
second
round
in
the
air
By
the
time
reinforcements
have
arrived
and
the
area
is
sealed
off
you've
got
your
spare
out
of
your
pocket
and
loaded
it
in
your
rifle
magazine
So
back
at
headquarters
when
the
de-brief
and
inquest
session
starts
they
take
your
gun
and
count
the
ammo
and
they
accept
that
you've
only
fired
one
round
Everybody
for
miles
around
has
heard
a
shot
then
shouting
then
another
shot
And
you'd
tell
them
that
you'd
been
on
patrol
and
somebody
had
fired
on
you
and
maybe
there
might
have
been
a
couple
of
them
and
you
had
yelled
a
warning
and
returned
fire
and
hit
one
of
them
And
if
they
had
a
dead
Provo
on
their
hands
and
his
weapon
it
didn't
matter
if
his
gun
had
been
fired
or
not
And
you
could
be
back
on
patrol
the
next
night
and
you'd
made
the
streets
a
little
safer
I
saw
a
double
bonus
one
night
when
there
was
a
drunken
brawl
Two
guys
were
having
a
fight
up
an
alleyway
We
heard
the
report
on
the
radio
and
went
over
One
of
the
squaddies
on
patrol
got
the
two
guys
up
against
a
wall
searched
them
and
found
weapons
To
the
amazement
of
everybody
he
said
Go
on
get
lost
don't
let
me
catch
you
doing
this
again
And
he
gave
them
the
weapons
back
As
they
ran
off
up
the
alleyway
he
shot
them
both
dead
In
the
report
it
was
said
we
could
see
they
were
in
possession
of
weapons
and
they
had
ignored
our
warnings
We
were
all
congratulated
for
our
quick
reactions
Another
time
three
of
us
were
doing
a
Vehicle
Check
Point
when
a
car
came
down
the
street
three
guys
in
it
and
refused
to
stop
A
shot
was
fired
at
us
and
they
sped
away
Two
of
my
men
opened
fire
on
the
car
They
killed
one
person
and
badly
wounded
another
The
car
crashed
about
fifty
or
sixty
yards
away
and
before
we
could
get
to
it
there
were
people
around
that
car
We
couldn't
force
a
way
through
without
starting
a
serious
riot
so
the
locals
took
the
three
guys
out
of
the
car
and
got
them
off
to
hospital
They
also
took
any
weapons
out
of
the
car
The
next
day
there's
a
major
complaint
filed
against
the
British
Army
for
shooting
unarmed
youths
It's
a
dirty
little
war
in
Belfast
But
occasionally
only
very
rarely
we
got
straight
results
and
some
satisfaction
when
the
Provos
self-destructed
We
were
patrolling
the
Clonard
area
in
our
PIG
that's
a
five-ton
Humber
armoured
vehicle
called
a
PIG
because
it
looks
like
one
long
square
and
with
a
big
snout
We
were
squinting
through
the
slits
in
the
side
the
gun
ports
watching
out
for
any
unusual
activity
when
I
spotted
a
guy
I
thought
I
recognised
from
the
Muppet
Show
This
was
the
line-up
of
mugshots
back
in
the
briefing
room
at
company
headquarters
a
wall
covered
with
head
and
shoulders
photos
of
wanted
IRA
suspects
Some
of
the
photos
were
copies
of
passport
pictures
sent
straight
to
the
Army
by
passport
office
clerks
in
Belfast
and
London
Others
were
slightly
out
of
focus
telephoto
shots
taken
at
demos
or
funerals
or
riots
And
some
were
from
the
files
of
the
Royal
Ulster
Constabulary
interrogation
centre
at
Castelreagh
You
could
always
tell
those
Perfect
focus
and
lighting
full
face
and
profile
but
you
had
to
use
your
i
Anyway
this
guy
in
Clonard
looked
familiar
and
suspicious
so
we
pulled
the
PIG
over
and
shouted
for
him
to
stop
He
ran
off
around
the
corner
so
we
chased
him
on
foot
and
cornered
him
in
an
alleyway
He
wasn't
a
very
impressive
character
A
sleazy
little
weasel
of
a
man
I
didn't
think
he
was
big
enough
to
be
a
gunman
He
was
more
like
a
thief
one
of
these
little
men
who
would
carry
guns
and
ammo
for
others
We
took
him
off
for
questioning
I
was
sitting
beside
the
driver
and
this
little
guy
was
in
the
back
with
a
soldier
on
either
side
of
him
He
was
dead
nervous
and
fidgety
Obviously
he'd
heard
stories
about
what
the
Brits
did
to
people
like
him
We
were
driving
along
when
there
was
this
incredible
WHOOF
in
the
back
of
the
PIG
and
the
little
guy
lifted
about
two
feet
from
his
seat
and
seemed
to
burst
out
of
his
jacket
and
then
collapsed
on
the
floor
It
looked
like
the
worst
case
of
haemorrhoids
I'd
ever
seen
Blood
everywhere
We
drove
him
straight
to
the
Victoria
Hospital
where
the
medics
signed
him
dead
on
arrival
They
diagnosed
that
he'd
hidden
a
fulminate
of
mercury
detonator
up
his
arse
Detonators
are
funny
things
Sometimes
they
won't
ignite
no
matter
how
much
electricity
you
put
through
them
and
sometimes
they'll
explode
just
from
the
heat
of
your
hand
So
once
he'd
hidden
it
where
he
did
he'd
more
or
less
signed
his
own
death
warrant
It
wasn't
a
pretty
way
to
go
He'd
died
of
internal
bleeding
within
seconds
That's
the
reality
of
the
situation
out
there
a
lot
of
distinctly
unglamorous
deaths
I
came
close
to
an
unglamorous
death
myself
in
the
Great
Falls
Road
Chip
Shop
Disaster
It
was
the
night
the
piss
hit
the
pan
The
IRA
had
set
up
Incident
Centres
in
houses
and
little
offices
all
over
the
Lower
Falls
where
local
people
could
go
and
file
complaints
against
the
Army
claiming
everything
from
furniture
being
smashed
during
house
searches
to
underwear
being
stolen
off
the
washing
line
We
reckoned
that
at
least
some
of
these
Incident
Centres
were
being
used
to
store
weapons
or
as
safe
houses
for
gunmen
on
the
run
but
we
needed
cast-iron
evidence
before
raiding
any
of
them
So
we
set
up
a
covert
observation
post
to
watch
one
of
the
Incident
Centres
just
opposite
a
popular
fish
and
chip
shop
in
the
Lower
Falls
The
chip
shop
was
ideally
situated
one
of
a
row
of
shops
and
offices
at
street
level
in
a
terrace
with
abandoned
and
derelict
flats
above
Under
the
cover
of
darkness
it
took
a
few
hours
and
three
different
patrols
to
get
us
in
position
Each
of
the
patrols
had
an
extra
man
on
duty
as
they
set
off
Five
men
would
enter
the
alleyway
behind
the
chip
shop
and
only
four
would
come
out
the
other
end
The
fifth
man
would
scuttle
up
the
rear
steps
and
into
the
derelict
flat
we
had
chosen
We
did
it
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
when
the
chip
shop
and
the
offices
were
closed
I
was
first
in
after
I'd
quietly
forced
off
the
wooden
board
which
had
been
nailed
over
the
door
Within
a
couple
of
hours
two
other
Guardsmen
had
joined
me
We
wedged
the
door
closed
behind
us
and
settled
down
for
the
next
three
days
with
pre-cooked
cold
rations
and
ziploc
plastic
bags
to
use
as
portable
field
latrines
By
daylight
next
morning
we
were
ready
blackened
up
with
camouflage
face
cream
hiding
in
the
shadows
a
few
feet
back
from
the
window
taking
photos
of
everyone
who
went
in
and
out
of
the
Incident
Centre
in
the
house
opposite
A
couple
of
nights
later
disaster
struck
It
was
Friday
night
the
busiest
night
in
the
chip
shop
One
of
the
plastic
latrine
bags
had
burst
unknown
to
us
and
the
contents
were
dripping
down
through
the
ceiling
into
the
shop
It
was
hitting
the
hot
fat
in
the
deep
pan
fryer
and
going
psssh
There
was
a
queue
of
hungry
people
out
as
far
as
the
door
and
they
began
to
shrink
back
against
the
wall
as
these
drips
began
to
splatter
searing
fat
over
the
counter
Now
nobody
smelled
anything
unusual
about
this
stream
of
liquid
but
there
you
are
And
the
wife
of
the
owner
looked
up
and
said
Holy
Mother
of
God
there's
a
leaking
pipe
up
there
Seamus
you'd
better
go
and
sort
it
out
When
we
heard
Seamus
coming
up
the
stairs
the
three
of
us
got
behind
the
door
Seamus
gave
one
heave
with
his
shoulder
to
free
the
wooden
wedge
and
we
jerked
the
door
open
grabbed
him
into
the
empty
flat
put
the
muzzle
of
a
Browning
mm
automatic
in
his
mouth
and
handcuffed
him
Our
observation
post
was
blown
I
grabbed
the
radio
and
whispered
our
Breakout
code
into
it
An
armoured
PIG
was
constantly
on
patrol
in
the
neighbourhood
and
the
crew
had
a
list
of
locations
for
our
hiding
places
They
knew
from
our
panic
Breakout
message
that
we
needed
to
be
rescued
fast
The
PIG
came
roaring
round
the
corner
from
North
Howard
Street
promptly
rammed
into
a
car
and
traffic
ground
to
a
halt
for
blocks
around
In
the
meantime
the
drips
of
piss
had
turned
into
a
steady
trickle
and
with
hot
fat
spraying
out
of
the
deep
pan
in
the
direction
of
the
gas
burners
the
customers
began
to
get
seriously
terrified
and
Seamus's
wife
lost
her
patience
She
asked
them
Will
you
be
hanging
on
just
a
while
and
I'll
see
what's
keeping
that
stupid
bugger
Seamus
So
she
plodded
up
the
stairs
and
found
herself
bundled
into
the
empty
flat
and
staring
down
a
gun
barrel
as
we
handcuffed
her
as
well
By
this
time
I'm
yelling
the
breakout
code
into
the
radio
and
listening
to
the
explosive
spluttering
of
cold
piss
and
hot
fat
and
smelling
the
smoky
fumes
drifting
up
through
the
floor
From
the
window
we
could
see
the
customers
retreating
back
into
the
street
waiting
for
the
explosion
and
fireball
Finally
the
PIG
screamed
into
the
alleyway
and
we
piled
in
taking
Seamus
and
his
wife
with
us
We
couldn't
afford
to
leave
them
behind
to
raise
the
alarm
But
a
couple
of
minutes
later
we
dumped
them
in
the
street
outside
our
base
took
off
the
cuffs
and
let
them
walk
back
to
their
shop
In
the
meantime
some
local
hero
had
realised
that
if
the
chip
shop
burst
into
flames
it
would
probably
take
out
most
of
the
houses
around
together
with
the
parish
church
and
the
primary
school
A
chip
shop
fire
has
got
about
the
same
destructive
yield
as
a
small
nuclear
device
If
you
don't
believe
me
ask
any
insurance
investigator
So
the
hero
crept
in
at
great
personal
risk
and
switched
off
the
gas
burners
Then
he
got
trampled
in
the
rush
of
hungry
looters
By
the
time
Seamus
and
his
wife
got
back
the
piss
was
sizzling
gently
and
the
fat
was
cooling
But
all
the
stock
was
gone
cod
plaice
chips
pickles
soft
drinks
cigarettes
Even
the
one-armed
bandit
in
the
corner
had
vanished
probably
on
its
way
to
a
patriotic
Republican
drinking
club
Seamus
and
his
wife
were
first
in
the
queue
at
the
Incident
Centre
across
the
street
next
morning
and
they
whacked
in
a
compensation
bill
to
the
Army
I
sometimes
wonder
if
the
Army
paid
it
in
full
It
would
have
been
cheap
at
the
price
I
had
stayed
with
the
smoking
chip
shop
to
the
last
possible
minute
like
a
captain
reluctant
to
leave
his
sinking
ship
but
the
whole
incident
was
a
shameful
blot
on
my
career
Still
the
last
thing
I
wanted
was
an
epitaph
which
said
John
Miller
soldier
Guyanese
rebel
and
terrorist
fighter
died
in
a

pan
fire

Chapter
Nine
The
actor
Anthony
Booth
well-known
for
his
film
and
television
roles
in
particular
the
series
Till
Death
Us
Do
Part
is
seriously
ill
in
hospital
today
with
third
degree
burns
after
an
horrific
accident
at
his
home
The
newscaster
carried
on
impassively
with
the
rest
of
the
day's
news
but
those
words
raced
around
my
head
Tony
My
old
mate
from
repertory
days
with
whom
I
had
shared
so
many
hilarious
times
and
even
a
hectic
but
passionate
romance
I
couldn't
imagine
him
lying
there
fighting
for
his
life
Over
in
the
hospital
Tony
was
hearing
the
same
broadcast
He
had
been
admitted
only
hours
before
and
was
lying
in
great
pain
literally
burning
up
and
flitting
in
and
out
of
consciousness
Wake
up
wake
up
Mr
Booth
the
nurse
said
You're
on
telly
He
turned
his
head
to
see
his
picture
on
the
screen
of
the
ITN
News
He
passed
out
again
only
to
be
woken
up
by
the
same
nurse
Quick
quick
You're
on
the
BBC
too
And
then
I
knew
I
was
in
trouble
Tony
told
me
later
If
it
was
on
the
BBC
as
well
I
must
be
dying
Tony's
wildness
in
those
early
days
in
the
theatre
I
found
very
attractive
He
had
a
great
infectious
laughter
about
him
and
used
to
do
utterly
mad
things
on
impulse
I
remember
in
one
company
we
had
a
great
character
actress
called
Velvy
Attwood
who
was
seventy
or
more
then
Tony
used
to
fling
open
the
door
of
her
dressing
room
and
say
I
want
you
Velvy
more
than
anything
in
the
world
Come
to
me
my
darling
There
was
Velvy
in
her
long
combinations
and
her
vest
saying
You
are
awful
Get
him
out
He's
horrible
He
did
it
for
devilment
and
Velvy
frankly
enjoyed
the
attention
We
first
met
way
back
in
the
mid-fifties
when
I
joined
the
company
in
a
play
called
A
Girl
Called
Sadie
which
was
later
to
become
famous
in
its
way
for
earning
managements
more
money
than
had
ever
been
done
before
I
was
the
leading
lady
earning
all
of
s
a
week
and
touring
all
over
Britain
Tony
was
playing
the
vicar
with
the
task
of
trying
to
reform
me
the
fallen
woman
That
was
on-stage
Off-stage
he
was
hotly
pursuing
me
The
cast
met
for
the
first
time
in
a
cold
bare
rehearsal
room
I
saw
this
bold
quick-witted
energetic
boy
standing
with
a
group
of
other
actors
In
my
time
I
may
have
been
called
a
controversial
outrageous
lady
Then
I
was
more
than
a
little
old-fashioned
in
my
outlook
on
life
Boys
had
to
be
well-behaved
and
show
proper
respect
for
girls
Tony
had
no
awe
and
no
respect
or
so
it
seemed
at
the
time
I
was
blonde
then
The
management
had
insisted
I
go
silver-blonde
for
the
part
of
Sadie
and
so
my
red
hair
had
to
be
dyed
much
to
my
mother's
consternation
That
was
all
right
when
it
was
first
done
but
after
nine
months
in
the
play
constantly
bleaching
my
hair
it
started
to
fall
out
My
hair
was
down
to
my
elbows
when
the
tour
started
When
it
finished
I
was
practically
bald
I
had
a
Yul
Brynner
bubble-cut
By
that
time
Tony
and
I
were
romantically
involved
He
used
to
say
he
was
going
out
with
the
only
bald
leading
lady
in
the
business
But
that
was
later
At
first
I
backed
off
from
his
advances
Just
out
of
my
first
disastrous
marriage
I
felt
I
wasn't
going
to
be
caught
again
Tony
nevertheless
set
out
to
woo
me
heavily
when
he
wasn't
playing
practical
jokes
on
me
and
the
rest
of
the
cast
We
had
a
marvellous
old
man
with
us
Louis
Nanton
who
played
the
doctor
He
had
to
open
his
doctor's
bag
on
stage
every
night
and
say
I'll
get
the
stethoscope
out
and
see
to
the
patient
One
night
before
he
went
out
Tony
filled
the
bag
with
all
sorts
of
rubbish
empty
cardboard
packets
and
papers
The
old
man
nearly
had
a
fit
when
he
opened
it
But
most
importantly
Tony
made
me
laugh
at
myself
He
made
me
realise
how
ridiculous
I
could
be
and
eventually
I
did
succumb
to
his
sense
of
humour
and
his
passion
But
not
until
with
the
perverse
streak
that
is
in
my
character
he
had
given
up
The
moment
he
stopped
chasing
me
I
changed
my
mind
That
was
the
start
of
our
love
affair
Our
wild
and
frantic
romance
We
were
both
young
without
a
home
or
very
much
money
but
we
were
madly
in
love
Too
much
so
perhaps
We
were
both
too
fiery
too
unbearably
on
the
go
at
that
time
We
would
have
burned
one
another
out
had
we
stayed
together
Tony
left
the
company
to
go
into
No
Time
For
Sergeants
while
I
remained
touring
with
Sadie
He
would
finish
work
on
Saturday
night
and
somehow
get
from
London
to
wherever
I
was
playing
On
one
occasion
he
was
found
climbing
in
through
a
bedroom
window
at
the
place
where
I
was
staying
On
another
he
flew
back
from
Rome
to
see
me
Time
went
on
and
we
began
to
go
our
different
ways
I
joined
another
company
still
touring
while
Tony
was
hitting
the
big
time
For
three
years
we
drifted
further
and
further
apart
Three
months
went
by
without
a
word
from
him
Proud
as
ever
I
tossed
my
head
and
went
off
But
still
I
couldn't
lose
sight
of
him
He
was
doing
well
in
films
and
earning
himself
a
reputation
as
a
tearaway
I
was
constantly
reading
in
the
newspapers
about
his
antics
I
knew
Tony
and
understood
all
this
Others
didn't
He
is
a
lot
like
me
The
thing
that
leads
him
into
trouble
is
his
directness
his
honesty
I
recognised
a
kindred
soul
Like
me
he
tried
to
fight
the
establishment
for
very
good
causes
and
for
others
rather
than
himself
Like
me
he
usually
finished
in
some
sort
of
trouble
I
read
stories
of
his
wildness
Stories
that
he
drank
a
lot
As
it
turned
out
he
didn't
drink
a
lot
but
he
got
drunk
very
quickly
He
had
a
sugar
deficiency
three
pints
and
he'd
be
absolutely
drunk
out
of
his
head
When
I
saw
the
stories
I
said
to
myself
That's
ridiculous
Tony
doesn't
drink
He
didn't
None
of
us
did
in
those
days
On
a
Friday
night
the
company
might
have
a
bottle
of
beer
apiece
to
celebrate
the
end
of
the
week
but
that's
all
I
couldn't
even
touch
the
stuff
now
I
could
not
connect
the
Tony
of
these
stories
with
the
man
I
knew
A
man
with
so
much
life
in
him
Lively
people
like
him
don't
need
drink
They've
got
their
own
source
of
energy
and
excitement
Nor
could
I
connect
a
dying
Tony
with
the
man
I
had
shared
a
grand
passion
with
all
those
years
before
In
any
case
love
was
the
last
thing
on
my
mind
as
I
thought
about
Tony
I
was
still
wounded
mentally
and
I
knew
Tony
was
physically
though
not
to
what
extent
He
was
just
a
friend
in
trouble
and
I
wanted
to
see
him
But
would
he
want
to
see
me
Since
we'd
parted
we'd
seen
each
other
only
once
many
years
later
on
the
set
of
Coronation
Street
when
he
came
in
to
play
Christine
Hargreaves
boyfriend
He
was
tied
up
emotionally
with
someone
else
and
so
was
I
We
barely
spoke
When
we
came
together
again
later
Tony
told
me
he
thought
I
was
snooty
I
thought
he
was
distant
We
were
both
retaining
a
distance
through
pride
I
knew
he'd
been
living
with
someone
for
many
years
and
there
were
children
Perhaps
I
would
be
intruding
if
I
visited
him
Twice
I
came
very
close
The
first
time
on
my
way
to
a
public
appearance
with
my
friend
Keith
we
drove
near
the
hospital
where
Tony
was
Time
was
short
and
we
couldn't
stop
The
second
time
I
was
with
a
girlfriend
Should
we
stop
and
see
Tony
Booth
I
asked
If
he's
the
guy
you
say
he
is
and
if
he's
burned
about
the
face
he
may
not
want
to
see
you
she
said
We
drove
on
I
wish
now
we
hadn't
To
see
him
was
not
meant
in
any
romantic
way
I
just
felt
perhaps
he
might
need
a
friend
As
it
turned
out
I
didn't
know
how
much
Tony
needed
a
friend
In
all
the
time
he
spent
in
hospital
apart
from
his
children
his
sister
and
Una
Stubbs
no
one
visited
him
No
one
He
was
very
much
deserted
by
others
he'd
thought
close
If
I'd
obeyed
my
instincts
and
gone
to
see
him
I
think
it
might
have
helped
I
don't
know
Certainly
he
did
have
a
very
bad
time
Several
months
later
I
got
a
phone
call
at
the
studios
It
was
Tony
Hello
Pat
It's
Tony
Tony
Booth
Oh
how
are
you
I
said
delighted
to
hear
his
voice
I'm
fine
fine
I'd
like
to
see
you
he
said
Well
why
don't
we
meet
for
lunch
next
week
At
the
Film
Exchange
here
in
Manchester
I
didn't
know
I
had
no
idea
of
his
circumstances
First
of
all
he
had
no
money
at
all
Secondly
he
could
hardly
walk
A
wind
would
blow
him
over
he
was
down
to
seven
stone
But
when
I
saw
him
at
the
Film
Exchange
he
was
well
dressed
he
was
groomed
Absolutely
super
I
noticed
he
wore
fingerless
gloves
on
his
burned
hands
Hello
Tony
I
called
across
the
room
Lovely
to
see
you
How
are
you
Oh
all
under
control
he
said
dismissing
his
horrific
injuries
with
a
wry
grin
But
what
about
you
How
are
you
I'm
a
great
believer
in
fate
that
enormous
plan
that
controls
all
our
lives
Part
of
that
plan
for
me
was
that
Tony
and
I
should
come
together
once
more
Why
else
should
I
think
of
him
so
many
years
later
Why
else
when
Tony
desperately
needed
someone
to
talk
to
someone
who
would
understand
should
he
be
reminded
of
me
But
in
the
beginning
it
was
just
friendship
We
talked
a
great
deal
and
I
began
to
understand
a
little
of
what
he
had
gone
through
What
you
really
need
is
some
publicity
I
told
him
So
that
people
will
know
Tony
Booth
is
back
fighting
and
ready
to
work
Come
and
stay
at
my
cottage
overnight
We'll
call
in
the
press
to
do
an
interview
You
know
an
old
mates
reunion
Yes
fine
he
agreed
He
came
fell
in
love
with
the
cottage
and
we
talked
half
the
night
away
that
first
evening
He
was
living
at
his
mother's
house
in
Liverpool
but
conditions
weren't
exactly
ideal
Why
don't
you
come
and
stay
here
until
you
finish
the
book
you're
working
on
There's
plenty
of
room
We
won't
get
in
each
other's
way
I
said
He
agreed
to
stay
but
only
as
a
working
and
paying
guest
Of
course
in
some
ways
I
was
wary
about
his
coming
to
stay
I
wanted
no
romantic
entanglement
and
told
him
so
straight
We're
just
friends
right
Tony
No
hanky
panky
I
didn't
really
think
he'd
be
interested
anyway
We'd
put
too
much
distance
between
us
There
were
always
friends
coming
and
going
I
was
living
my
life
dashing
off
all
over
the
place
I
thought
there
would
be
no
problems
like
that
Tony
needed
someone
to
talk
to
He
was
starved
of
theatrical
conversation
He
hadn't
worked
as
an
actor
for
about
two
years
before
the
accident
So
he
missed
actors
tales
I'd
come
home
at
night
usually
shattered
by
the
day's
rehearsing
or
filming
and
we'd
talk
and
talk
Curled
up
in
a
chair
in
front
of
the
flickering
fire
I'd
tell
him
of
my
day
things
that
had
happened
at
the
studio
One
evening
on
Kitty
my
housekeeper's
night
off
I
was
greeted
by
delicious
smells
coming
from
the
kitchen
I
walked
through
and
found
Tony
wooden
spoon
in
hand
preparing
dinner
I'm
chef
tonight
he
said
And
I'm
a
good
one
It's
time
you
allowed
someone
to
spoil
you
you
don't
eat
enough
The
meal
he
served
was
superb
There
was
wine
for
me
and
orange
juice
for
Tony
He
swears
he
will
never
drink
again
He
doesn't
even
like
the
taste
any
more
We
talked
of
old
times
laughing
over
old
memories
Both
of
us
had
a
different
view
of
each
other
He
told
me
how
haughty
I'd
been
in
those
days
He
reminded
me
of
things
I'd
forgotten
about
myself
Things
I
deserved
to
be
reminded
of
He
talked
about
what
had
happened
to
him
his
experiences
in
hospital
Even
then
his
burns
were
unhealed
and
yet
he
turned
his
tragedy
into
laughter
I
was
filled
not
with
pity
but
with
sympathy
and
admiration
for
his
courage

Carthage
May
Our
long
weekend
leave
was
about
to
start
Friday
till
Monday!
Where
to
spend
it
Edgington
I
said
as
I
shaved
with
a
thousand
year
old
blade
my
face
a
sea
of
cuts
All
my
born
days
I've
wanted
to
see
the
ruins
of
Carthage
I
think
you've
only
got
a
pint
of
blood
left
says
Edgington
I
must
hurry
What's
a
Carthage
said
Doug
Kidgell
A
great
archaeological
site
Oh
said
Kidgell
Why
we
goin
you
got
friends
there
It's
to
improve
my
education
Can't
we
go
to
the
pictures
said
Kidgell
There's
Bing
Crosby
in
The
Road
to
Bali
in
Tunis
That
evening
excited
as
schoolboys
we
drove
off
along
the
Tunis-Bizerta
road
it
was
as
though
the
war
didn't
exist
eventually
we
pull
up
on
a
sandy
beach
for
the
night
There
was
no
moon
but
the
sky
was
a
pin-cushion
of
stars
Great
swathes
of
astral
light
blinked
at
us
across
space
We
made
a
fire
glowing
scarlet
in
cobalt
black
darkness
showers
of
popping
sparks
jettisoning
into
the
night
air
Tins
of
steak
and
kidney
pud
were
in
boiling
water
with
small
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
Ready
soon
said
Doug
poking
the
fire
the
only
poke
he
would
have
for
a
long
time
Fildes
and
Edgington
were
making
up
their
beds
in
the
lorry
Edgington
singing
while
Fildes
spoke
to
himself
It
was
interesting
to
hear
A
cigarette
that
bears
lipstick
traces-
I
think
I'll
put
three
blankets
on
top
An
air
line
ticket
to
romantic
places!
It's
going
to
get
chilly
later
A
fairground's
painted
swings
Better
keep
my
socks
on
tonight
These
foolish
things
Where's
that
bloody
pillow
Remind
me
of
you
Kidgell
in
the
driving
cab
is
finishing
off
an
I
love
you
for
ever
letter
You
don't
write
many
Milligan
I
let
em
all
worry
What
about
your
folks
Well
they
worry
about
me
all
the
time
Before
the
war
they
worried
if
I
went
to
the
toilet
even
if
I
was
in
the
gardens
they'd
shout
out
Are
you
alright
son
They'd
wake
me
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
say
Are
you
alright
son
They're
natural
worriers
My
father
would
wake
up
at
in
the
morning
and
worry
about
his
job
and
my
mother
would
worry
about
him
worrying
about
his
job
They
sound
a
mite
strange
mate
A
mite
They're
insane!
Every
night
when
my
father
comes
home
from
work
he
gets
his
pistol
from
under
the
stairs
then
shouts
Hitler!
if
you're
in
this
house
come
out
with
your
hands
up
Let
me
tell
you
Kidgell
I'm
bloody
worried
about
them
We
sat
around
the
fire
opening
the
tins
with
a
Jack
knife
Army
cooks
don't
like
tinned
food
says
Kidgell
Why
not
They
can't
sod
it
up
in
tins
They
like
fresh
stuff
they
can
burn
the
Jesus
out
of
The
motto
of
the
Army
Catering
Corps
is
Help
wipe
the
smile
off
a
soldier's
face
Got
him!
said
a
triumphant
Edgington
smashing
a
mosquito
on
his
wrist
sending
his
marmalade
pudding
flying
into
the
fire
Bugger
he
said
trying
to
retrieve
it
with
a
stick
In
a
food
frenzy
he
dashes
to
the
lorry
returns
at
speed
with
rifle
and
bayonet
A
heroic
sight
as
he
lunged
time
and
terse
again
to
retrieve
the
blackened
duff
Don't
forget
thrust
turn
withdraw
said
Kidgell
Gentlemen
a
surprise!
I
produced
a
small
bottle
of
Schnapps
It
fell
off
the
back
of
a
Major
Chater
Jack
That
is
a
spoil
of
war
said
Edgington
striking
a
dramatic
finger-pointing
pose
Well
it's
not
going
to
spoil
mine
I
said
pouring
out
the
white
liquid
Alf
sipped
and
grasped
his
throat
Christ!
If
they
drink
this
they
are
the
master
race
It
was
fiery
stuff
It'll
kill
us
said
Edgington
He
spat
a
mouthful
on
the
fire
it
exploded
in
a
sheet
of
flame
See
Mind
you
go
to
the
bog
for
Christ's
sake
don't
strike
a
match
We
mellowed
Harry
got
hiccups
Edg
I
wonder
hic
what's
going
to
hickhappen
to
us
next
He
didn't
have
long
to
wait
for
the
answer
a
spark
shot
out
of
the
fire
and
burnt
him
We
sat
close
to
the
fire
The
smoke
kept
the
mossies
away
an
occasional
brave
one
would
die
under
hand
as
it
landed
Silly
sods
I
wouldn't
risk
my
life
to
pass
on
malaria
said
Fildes
I
think
I'll
turn
in
Through
the
night
a
ton
lorry
with
a
mosquito
net
across
the
back
was
home
to
four
lads
from
London
who
slept
sounder
and
safer
than
those
in
bomb
ridden
London
It
seemed
all
wrong
but
then
it
was
alright
by
me
A
letter
told
of
my
eccentric
father's
career
as
a
Captain
He
had
decided
that
the
RAOC
Depot
at
Reigate
was
wide
open
to
paratroops
He
took
it
upon
himself
to
make
a
life-like
raid
on
the
Depot
He
briefed
a
dozen
NCO's
They
chose
mid-day
The
officers
are
in
the
Mess
having
a
pre-lunch
tossup
the
men
are
queueing
in
the
mess
hall
Suddenly
the
cookhouse
staff
are
surrounded
by
men
with
black
faces
and
tommy
guns
Their
leader
is
speaking
in
a
strange
patois
Ands
up
Schell
git
against
that
bleedin
wall
Englander
please
In
the
Officers
Mess
from
behind
the
bar
arose
men
with
blackened
faces
one
wearing
a
German
helmet
and
holding
a
machine
pistol
Last
orders
pliss
undt
hands
up
It
was
my
father
The
officers
were
then
locked
in
an
office
where
it
was
simple
to
phone
police
A
constable
arrived
and
my
father
then
explained
the
whole
scheme
The
Colonel
said
You're
a
bloody
fool
and
had
him
posted
to
RAOC
Elstree
We
were
up
at
first
light
and
away
through
Tunis
on
the
Carthage
road
Let's
play
some
party
games
I
said
I
make
up
the
first
line
and
you
have
to
rhyme
the
next
There
was
a
young
gunner
called
Harry
KIDGELL
Told
the
MO
he
wanted
to
marry
EDG
The
MO
said
Oh
ALF
Is
it
Bexhill
Flo
ME
He
said
No
it's
old
Calcutta
Carrie
The
blue
Mediterranean
flanked
the
road
we
were
as
free
as
we
would
ever
be
in
our
lives
We
pulled
up
at
a
lonely
beach
plunged
into
the
azure
waters
with
Edgington
as
base
man
we
repeatedly
tried
balancing
on
each
other
We
got
as
far
as
then
collapsed
with
great
artificial
screams
and
dramatic
plunges
into
the
briny
One
of
us
would
submerge
and
sing
a
song
and
from
the
rising
bubbles
you
had
to
guess
what
tune
it
was
Life
was
golden
and
we
were
the
assayers
Evening
we
made
camp
by
a
sandy
verge
We
ate
and
talked
At
we
bedded
down
Good
nights
were
exchanged
At
midnight
we
were
still
talking
This
is
marvellous
isn't
it
says
Edgington
I
don't
like
going
to
sleep
cause
I'll
miss
it

EDGE
You're
evil
Milligan
with
all
that
shaggin
it's
going
to
drop
off
one
day
DOUG
Believe
me
it
won't
half
make
a
noise
when
it
hits
the
ground
We
awoke
at
first
light
and
played
Who's
going
to
make
the
tea
By
ten
past
no-one
had
given
in
finally
Edge
arises
bent
double
bladder
bursting
I'll
make
it
He'll
only
just
make
it
I
thought
We
heard
him
tinkering
about
outside
he
broke
into
a
little
tune
Don't
blame
me
For
falling
in
love
with
you
I'm
under
your
spell
But
how
can
I
help
it
don't
blame
BUGGER
How's
he
going
to
rhyme
that
I
thought
He'd
burnt
himself
With
Edgington
striking
a
match
could
lead
to
any-
thing
Edgington
tying
a
boot-lace
could
end
up
with
a
broken
arm
Edgington
cutting
his
toe
nails
could
mean
an
amputated
leg
Come
and
get
it!
We
got
it
fried
eggs
and
sand
It
was
just
after
a.m
when
Doug
put
the
lorry
in
gear
and
started
following
the
signs
What
happened
at
the
Carthage
said
Doug
who
was
still
puzzled
It
was
a
great
Naval
Power!
Had
a
war
with
Rome
I
forget
the
score
The
Romans
razed
the
city
and
ploughed
the
ground
with
salt
How
did
you
know
all
that
Chambers
Encyclopaedia
I
said
as
a
kid
I
loved
reading
Given
a
chance
I
could
have
been
a
great
scholar
even
University
You
could
have
been
a
great
University
Everyone
ought
to
get
a
university
education
said
Al
I
reckon
if
Harry
had
been
through
a
university
he
might
be
writing
concertos
instead
of
burning
himself
makin
the
tea
I
think
he'd
burn
himself
writing
a
concerto
Chambers
Encyclopaedia
said
Harry
I
thought
that
was
the
history
of
Piss
Pots
Without
warning
Kidgell
burst
into
song
Loveeeeeee
let
me
taste
the
wine
from
your
lipssss
and
then
went
into
hysterical
laughter
He's
goin
off
his
nut
said
Edgington
it
happens
to
short
arses
like
him
Doug
frowned
smiled
and
grimaced
as
only
a
facial
cripple
could
Short
arsed
men
are
well
known
for
their
power
Take
Nelson
You're
not
said
Fildes
querulously
you're
not
lumping
yourself
in
his
class
A
smile
played
across
Kidgell's
face
Answer
answer
shouted
Edgington
branding
his
fist
on
the
dashboard
and
cutting
his
finger
Yes
said
Kidgell
I
do
I
have
the
same
short
arsed
qualifications
as
im
it's
just
that
I
never
had
the
same
chances
Al
turned
and
looked
at
Kidgell
What
are
you
staring
at
he
giggled
Christ
chuckled
Al
you
in
charge
of
the
H.M.S
Victory
How
do
you
know
that
inside
me
there
isn't
a
brilliant
naval
tactician
Say
Ahhhh
I
said
and
I'll
look
for
him
Personally
you
look
more
like
a
Nelson
said
Edgington
Alright
alright
you
think
what
you
want
I
still
say
short
arses
have
a
greater
power
over
their
fellow
men
by
reason
that
they're
nearer
the
ground
and
haven't
got
so
far
to
fall
That
baffled
the
lot
of
us
and
we
gave
up
Edgington
was
bending
his
fingers
over
each
other
to
make
Crab
Claws
I
learned
this
as
a
nipper
he
said
We
set
off
again
sucking
our
ration
of
boiled
sweets
We
were
doing
miles
an
hour
at
that
speed
you
could
say
Look
at
that
but
at
modern
speeds
it's
Did
you
see
that
Finally
CARTHAGE!
We
parked
by
a
clump
of
trees
and
walked
to
the
ruins
of
the
amphitheatre
It
was
almost
featureless
now
What
a
sight
it
must
have
presented
clad
in
marble
as
high
as
El
Djem
the
sun
of
Africa
reflecting
its
white
surface
the
roar
of
crowds
the
blood
the
mangled
remains
like
Celtic
vs
Rangers
Is
this
it
said
Doug
Yes
This
is
what
I
missed
Bing
Crosby
on
the
Road
to
Bali
for
It's
terrible
it's
like
Catford
One
minute
you're
allying
yourself
with
Nelson
and
when
you
see
history
you
say
it's
Catford!
You
short
arse
I
only
brought
you
here
because
the
ruins
were
low
enough
for
you
to
see
over
Well
says
Kidgell
I
still
say
a
Carthage
is
not
as
good
as
Bing
Crosby
in
the
Road
to
Bali
We
brewed
our
tea
on
the
floor
of
the
arena
it
was
hard
to
believe
blood
spilled
here
years
ago
We
upped
anchors
and
drove
on
finally
Doug
picked
a
spot
adjacent
to
a
heavily
bombed
French
maritime
repair
docks
Ah!
says
Kidgell
This
looks
more
like
a
Carthage
He
backed
the
truck
under
a
large
tree
a
small
group
of
Arabs
with
donkeys
and
a
camel
are
passing
towards
Tunis
They
sell
us
oranges
eggs
dates
and
things
that
look
and
taste
like
Pistachio
nuts
mainly
because
they
were
After
a
day
of
swimming
we
are
in
bed
smoking
and
talking
Got
to
be
back
by
mid-day
tomorrow
sod
it
said
Doug
regretfully
Good
night
lads
yawned
Edgington
Steady
I
said
You
haven't
had
an
accident
for
an
hour

Chapter
Seven
Friday
March
th
was
a
dreary
day
The
weather
was
cold
and
dull
and
by
evening
a
steady
rain
had
set
in
Outside
the
crocuses
were
flowering
well
but
the
day
belonged
more
to
winter
than
to
spring
And
so
it
was
on
that
wet
gloomy
evening
that
we
first
heard
the
news
of
a
disaster
that
shocked
the
world
John
and
I
supper
over
had
just
settled
down
with
a
pot
of
tea
to
watch
television
But
the
set
had
hardly
warmed
up
when
our
programme
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
newsflash
The
teacups
froze
in
our
hands
as
we
listened
in
horror
A
Townsend
Thoresen
ferry
the
Herald
of
Free
Enterprise
had
capsized
just
outside
Zeebrugge
Hundreds
of
passengers
were
on
board
and
every
boat
in
the
area
was
racing
to
the
rescue
Like
most
people
I
think
our
first
reaction
was
one
of
total
disbelief
I'd
never
been
on
one
of
those
ferries
but
I'd
seen
pictures
of
them
often
enough
Huge
and
solid
seemingly
crammed
to
overflowing
with
cars
and
excited
holiday-makers
they
looked
stable
well-made
and
indestructible
How
could
one
of
these
giants
possibly
turn
over
in
a
calm
sea
before
it
had
even
properly
left
the
harbour
It
just
didn't
make
sense
Yet
believe
it
or
not
as
that
tense
evening
went
on
it
became
clear
that
if
anything
the
tragedy
had
at
first
been
underplayed
Hundreds
of
people
were
saved
of
course
but
as
we
discovered
later
close
on
were
killed
Those
poor
souls
I
thought
I've
always
been
a
bit
claustrophobic
and
the
idea
of
being
trapped
in
a
ship
as
it
rolled
over
in
the
water
made
me
shudder
How
did
they
bear
it
Even
the
ones
who
returned
safely
must
have
gone
through
an
appalling
ordeal
What
a
way
to
end
a
holiday
My
mind
went
back
to
my
last
stay
in
hospital
While
I
was
there
a
number
of
nurses
were
collecting
coupons
for
just
such
a
trip
Apparently
a
national
newspaper
was
offering
shopping-trips
on
the
continent
for
plus
a
number
of
special
coupons
printed
in
the
paper
Every
morning
when
I'd
finished
reading
the
news
I
shared
my
coupons
amongst
the
eager
nurses
I
could
only
pray
that
I
hadn't
unwittingly
sent
some
poor
young
girl
to
a
watery
grave
by
my
choice
of
reading
material
For
days
afterwards
accounts
of
the
disaster
and
the
complicated
business
of
recovering
bodies
went
on
and
the
newspapers
were
full
of
harrowing
tales
Then
in
the
midst
of
it
all
Laurie
rang
A
desperate
couple
who'd
lost
their
son
in
the
tragedy
had
contacted
him
Naturally
they
were
distraught
and
they
wondered
if
I
could
help
What
d'you
think
Doris
asked
Laurie
I
know
you're
very
busy
I
didn't
hesitate
There
was
no
question
in
my
mind
I
knew
I
had
to
see
them
Fit
them
in
somehow
Laurie
I
said
I'll
see
them
as
soon
as
I
possibly
can
In
the
meantime
I'll
give
them
a
ring
Mrs
Reynolds
had
been
in
quite
a
state
as
any
mother
would
have
been
Her
son
Jonathan
and
his
fiancee
Fiona
had
set
off
for
a
day's
shopping-trip
to
Belgium
planning
to
return
aboard
the
ill-fated
Herald
of
Free
Enterprise
They
never
came
back
Since
then
Fiona's
body
had
been
recovered
but
Jonathan's
was
still
missing
There
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
Jonathan
was
definitely
on
the
other
side
As
I
talked
to
his
parents
on
the
phone
a
young
man's
voice
suddenly
chimed
in
on
the
conversation
I
had
Mrs
Reynolds
in
one
ear
and
Jonathan
in
the
other
He
gave
me
a
few
family
names
His
mother
was
called
Joan
he
said
his
father
was
Alan
and
his
sister
was
Sonya
They
feel
bad
because
my
body
is
still
trapped
down
there
he
said
but
tell
them
not
to
grieve
It
doesn't
matter
at
all
because
I'm
not
under
the
water
I'm
here
and
I'm
safe
I
passed
this
on
to
Alan
and
Joan
and
I
tried
to
explain
that
a
body
is
just
a
coat
we
put
on
when
we
come
to
this
earth
and
that
once
our
time
here
is
done
we
don't
need
it
any
more
It
really
doesn't
matter
what
happens
to
our
old
clothes
A
funeral
is
just
a
comfort
for
the
living
it
serves
no
useful
purpose
to
the
loved
one
who's
gone
on
although
he
may
well
attend
because
it's
a
big
family
gathering
just
as
he'll
attend
future
weddings
christenings
and
celebrations
because
he's
part
of
the
family
By
the
end
of
the
conversation
they
seemed
calmer
and
I
think
the
chat
brought
them
a
little
comfort
Shortly
afterwards
they
came
down
from
their
home
near
Oxford
for
a
full-scale
sitting
I'm
sorry
to
say
that
when
they
arrived
at
midday
I
was
still
in
my
dressing-gown
and
not
at
all
sure
that
I
could
go
through
with
it
Once
again
I
seemed
to
have
been
struck
down
by
some
mysterious
complaint
My
head
ached
I
felt
dizzy
every
time
I
tried
to
stand
and
I
kept
going
hot
and
cold
To
make
matters
worse
we
had
a
blocked
drain
that
day
and
workmen
were
bustling
backwards
and
forwards
and
the
phone
kept
ringing
Laurie
called
early
that
morning
to
drop
in
some
papers
and
he
found
me
weak
and
ready
to
panic
l
don't
think
I'm
going
to
be
able
to
manage
Laurie
I
said
anxiously
I
feel
so
rotten
I
think
we'd
better
change
it
to
another
day
But
when
Laurie
rang
the
Reynolds
number
there
was
no
reply
They'd
already
left
Oh
well
I
said
as
philosophically
as
I
could
we
can't
turn
them
away
I'll
just
have
to
hope
the
spirit
world
doesn't
let
me
down
and
I
swallowed
a
couple
of
Disprin
and
crossed
my
fingers
I'm
so
glad
now
that
I
did
The
three
Reynolds
arrived
dressed
in
black
They
were
smart
and
composed
but
the
tension
around
their
eyes
belied
the
calm
exterior
Inside
they
were
suffering
badly
Laurie
showed
them
into
the
front
room
and
brought
them
coffee
while
I
apologized
for
my
dishevelled
appearance
I'm
so
sorry
I
explained
I
haven't
been
at
all
well
and
it
was
all
I
could
do
to
get
out
of
bed
this
morning
I
don't
know
if
I'm
going
to
be
any
good
to
you
That's
all
right
Doris
said
Mrs
Reynolds
sympathetically
We
quite
understand
We're
just
glad
you
could
see
us
at
all
Well
I
can't
promise
anything
I
warned
I'll
do
the
very
best
I
can
but
quite
honestly
I
don't
know
if
it's
going
to
work
Well
if
it
doesn't
it
doesn't
said
Mrs
Reynolds
reassuringly
We
sipped
our
coffee
and
chatted
about
the
weather
and
the
journey
and
the
problems
with
the
drains
and
all
the
time
I
prodded
with
my
mind
at
the
spirit
world
At
first
there
was
a
great
deal
of
confusion
Hardly
surprising
really
when
you
consider
how
many
poor
souls
found
themselves
ejected
without
warning
into
the
spirit
world
in
such
an
unforeseen
tragedy
Then
through
the
confusion
there
came
a
great
sense
of
urgency
There
was
some
important
news
on
the
way
In
fact
the
news
should
be
arriving
that
very
day
I
think
we're
ready
now
I
said
at
last
to
the
Reynolds
I'm
getting
a
feeling
of
confusion
and
then
this
urgency
Something
about
some
news
Have
you
had
some
news
today
The
family
shook
their
heads
No
they
said
Well
there's
some
news
on
its
way
and
it
will
come
today
I
said
They
shrugged
There
was
after
all
no
way
of
telling
if
I
was
right
or
wrong
Yet
later
that
evening
when
I
turned
on
the
television
I
was
just
in
time
to
catch
the
announcement
that
the
date
for
the
attempted
refloating
of
the
Herald
of
Free
Enterprise
had
been
fixed
that
very
day
The
refloating
was
an
important
event
because
without
it
the
remaining
bodies
could
not
be
recovered
This
was
the
news
the
spirit
world
had
been
preparing
us
for
As
it
turned
out
the
intended
date
came
and
went
and
the
ship
stayed
where
it
was
due
to
bad
weather
but
nevertheless
the
message
had
been
correct
There
was
news
that
day
That
out
of
the
way
two
bright
young
people
stepped
boldly
into
the
picture
I
could
hear
them
laughing
and
chattering
together
for
several
moments
before
moving
close
enough
to
speak
to
me
What
a
happy
pair
they
sounded
I've
never
heard
a
couple
laugh
so
much
as
these
two
Shush
a
minute
Fee
said
Jonathan
I
just
want
to
tell
them
we're
together
They've
been
worrying
about
that
They
think
we
got
separated
but
we
didn't
We
came
over
together
and
we're
going
to
go
on
together
from
now
on
All
three
Reynolds
were
visibly
relieved
when
I
told
them
this
Thank
goodness
whispered
Joan
Reynolds
almost
silently
eyes
half
closed
And
suddenly
I
understood
her
fears
Fiona's
body
and
the
body
of
her
thirteen-year-old
sister
Heidi
had
been
found
while
Jonathan's
had
not
and
she
was
worried
that
because
they
had
not
been
laid
to
rest
together
they
might
be
separated
for
all
time
Of
course
it
doesn't
work
like
that
at
all
People
who
both
want
to
be
together
can
be
together
They
meet
up
as
soon
as
they
pass
over
if
they
wish
to
it's
as
simple
as
that
but
Joan
Alan
and
Sonya
weren't
to
know
Now
I
know
we
don't
want
to
dwell
on
it
I
said
silently
to
Jonathan
but
can
you
tell
us
what
happened
There
were
seven
of
us
he
explained
Later
the
Reynolds
confirmed
that
Jonathan
Fiona
and
Heidi
had
indeed
been
part
of
a
party
of
seven
who'd
set
off
on
a
day's
shopping-trip
in
Belgium
just
for
the
fun
of
it
Fiona
and
I
went
to
the
bar
to
get
a
drink
Jonathan
went
on
and
we
got
separated
from
the
others
We
never
saw
them
again
As
his
words
died
away
I
felt
the
dreadful
sensation
of
icy
water
all
around
me
and
a
terrible
dark
confined
space
the
water
crept
higher
and
higher
and
I
could
hear
people
screaming
Quickly
I
closed
my
mind
to
the
impression
With
my
claustrophobic
tendencies
I
couldn't
take
much
of
scenes
like
that
It's
okay
Jonathan
I
get
the
picture
I
told
him
silently
Don't
dwell
on
it
love
I
could
swim
and
I
was
trying
to
help
people
Jonathan
went
on
but
there
was
no
way
out
A
bit
later
he
came
in
too
close
to
me
and
I
could
feel
my
lungs
filling
up
with
water
I
began
choking
and
gasping
for
air
Jonathan!
I
called
out
mentally
I
didn't
have
enough
breath
to
say
it
aloud
You've
come
in
too
close
Move
back
a
bit
love
This
sometimes
happens
with
inexperienced
spirit
communicators
especially
if
the
medium
is
tired
or
below
par
generally
The
medium
loses
concentration
and
unintentionally
fails
to
remind
the
spirit
person
to
keep
a
safe
distance
between
them
When
this
happens
the
spirit
person's
last
impressions
come
across
so
strongly
that
the
medium
starts
to
live
them
with
potentially
dangerous
results
Once
I'd
finished
coughing
I
felt
it
was
wiser
to
stick
to
more
mundane
subjects
I
asked
Jonathan
if
he'd
had
anything
of
value
on
him
which
his
family
could
keep
when
the
body
was
eventually
found
A
watch
or
something
I
suggested
I
felt
him
shake
his
head
Not
really
My
watch
wasn't
very
safe
he
said
That's
right
he
was
talking
to
me
about
it
not
long
ago
said
Joan
The
metal
bracelet
was
dodgy
Jonathan
gave
some
more
family
names
and
details
and
then
I
got
a
number
Someone
listed
at
twenty-something
It
was
very
fuzzy
Could
have
been
twenty-two
Fiona
lived
at
twenty-seven
said
Joan
And
at
the
mention
of
her
name
Fiona
made
Jonathan
stand
aside
for
a
moment
to
let
her
speak
All
my
things
are
still
there
at
number
twenty-seven
just
the
way
they
were
she
said
Tell
them
not
to
grieve
You
see
my
parents
were
separated
and
for
a
while
it
was
difficult
for
me
Jonathan
was
my
life
I
wasn't
very
happy
before
I
met
him
but
then
we
met
and
he
was
everything
to
me
I
looked
on
his
parents
as
my
parents
and
I
loved
them
very
much
You'd
better!
interrupted
Jonathan
teasingly
And
then
they
were
laughing
again
Come
on
you
two!
I
said
pretending
to
be
irritated
as
the
giggles
went
on
Let's
give
your
mum
and
dad
a
bit
more
to
go
on
What
did
you
do
for
living
Jonathan
Instantly
I
was
given
a
picture
of
a
table
piled
high
with
books
and
papers
and
sheets
of
writing
It
looked
very
much
like
a
student's
untidy
desk
Was
he
studying
I
asked
the
Reynolds
Because
he's
showing
me
lots
of
books
and
papers
Was
he
still
at
college
Yes
he
was
said
Alan
It
turned
out
that
Jonathan
was
only
nineteen
years
old
and
he
was
taking
a
course
in
surveying
and
land
management
at
a
polytechnic

No
one
accomplishes
anything
in
sport
without
believing
in
herself
and
without
getting
a
lot
of
help
In
Helsinki
I
began
to
believe
in
myself
more
firmly
and
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
my
most
ambitious
dream
and
I
certainly
do
now
except
on
those
few
mornings
when
like
everyone
else
in
the
world
I
don't
Fortunately
on
those
days
my
coach
brings
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
urges
me
patiently
to
get
up
and
go
training
If
I
don't
she
gets
less
patient
and
more
outspoken
You
have
to
coach
the
mind
as
well
as
the
body
She
has
done
that
from
the
start
Last
winter
when
no
one
discovered
for
four
months
that
a
bone
in
my
heel
was
out
of
place
the
injury
became
so
painful
that
I
could
hardly
walk
on
it
and
certainly
couldn't
run
The
treatment
I
was
getting
on
my
back
and
hamstring
cortisone
tissue
manipulation
would
have
worked
if
that
tiny
bone
had
not
been
a
fraction
out
of
position
Understandably
the
foot
was
ignored
until
throwing
commenced
as
part
of
my
winter
training
in
March
Mum
is
my
only
coach
but
we
get
ideas
from
specialists
regarding
weights
bounding
running
and
so
forth
My
osteopath
is
Terry
Moule
whom
I
see
regularly
and
who
is
also
a
nutritionist
Seb
Coe
recommended
Terry
Moule
who
sees
a
lot
of
British
athletes
and
who
designed
the
diet
which
makes
it
possible
for
me
to
build
muscle
I
have
been
going
to
Terry
since
November
Willie
Banks
the
triple
jumper
has
given
me
good
training
tips
The
weightlifter
Geoff
Capes
has
too
Don
Quarrie
has
given
me
helpful
advice
on
sprints
as
has
Linford
Christie's
crash
coach
Sometimes
I
train
with
Verona
Elder
Both
she
and
her
husband
have
been
good
to
me
I
do
my
weight
training
with
a
partner
For
years
Mick
who
is
a
docker
and
I
trained
in
an
unheated
garage
about
five
minutes
from
home
It
was
so
cold
in
the
winter
that
each
time
I
put
another
weight
on
the
bar
I
felt
I
was
picking
up
a
chunk
of
ice
I
still
do
my
weight
training
in
Mick's
garage
but
as
Mick
can
no
longer
get
off
work
Mum
helps
me
out
now
Victory
is
sweet
they
say
Like
expensive
chocolate
The
truth
is
that
the
taste
of
victory
imminent
victory
was
in
my
case
strawberry-flavoured
Complan
I
had
been
drinking
four
five
even
six
glasses
of
it
every
day
for
three
years
But
hard
graft
and
a
good
foundation
aren't
enough
to
become
a
winner
It
takes
magic
The
real
alchemy
of
Helsinki
the
magic
was
that
it
transformed
me
into
a
world-reckoned
winner
Just
a
week
after
the
Worlds
I
transmuted
silver
into
gold
at
the
Europa
Cup
This
time
I
was
no
one's
back-up
I
was
the
British
number
one
But
I
was
Antoanetta
Todorova's
heiress
She
had
won
it
the
previous
time
this
year
it
belonged
to
me
Mine
was
the
first
gold
medal
ever
won
by
a
British
woman
in
a
European
throwing
event
I
knew
I
was
on
my
way
Three
or
four
days
later
I
had
my
tonsils
out
I
wouldn't
miss
them
That
was
a
small
problem
but
even
the
big
ones
I
sensed
would
no
longer
deflect
me
Not
my
grief
which
was
always
there
Not
my
shoulder
or
back
pain
Not
even
an
operation
for
fibroids
two
months
before
I
threw
metres
at
the
Talbot
Games
Until
that
summer
of
though
Tessa
had
always
been
there
a
bit
ahead
In
a
way
Tessa
had
been
a
help
an
inspiration
She
was
five
years
older
than
me
five
years
further
along
the
way
and
always
up
there
the
British
number
one
something
to
aim
at
I
always
knew
that
one
day
I
would
take
on
the
mantle
Perhaps
Tessa
knew
it
too
Maybe
that's
why
she
has
said
some
snide
and
utterly
untrue
things
about
me
and
Mum
Funny
isn't
it
that
after
I
had
been
the
victim
of
a
pro-Tessa
hate-mail
campaign
of
anonymous
letters
which
I
reported
to
the
police
she
then
decided
that
she
too
had
been
the
victim
of
such
a
campaign
I
have
more
sympathy
for
Tessa
on
the
issue
of
anabolic
steroids
which
she
has
been
suspected
of
taking
as
have
I
Tessa
denies
vociferously
that
she
has
ever
taken
these
or
any
other
illegal
drugs
as
I
do
I
have
never
taken
such
drugs
and
I
never
will
In
Britain
we
have
the
best
scrutiny
of
athletes
in
the
world
It
would
be
impossible
to
cheat
if
you
wanted
to
I
don't
want
to
And
it
is
perfectly
right
that
people
who
do
cheat
get
caught
They
are
ruining
our
sport
Anna
Verouli
the
Greek
girl
who
was
a
one-year
wonder
going
from
eleventh
place
in
the
World
Student
Games
to
gold
in
the
European
Javelin
Championship
in
that
short
time
tested
positive
for
anabolic
steroids
at
the
Los
Angeles
Olympics
Many
people
think
Anna
must
have
had
the
benefit
of
those
muscle-building
drugs
when
she
won
in
Athens
On
a
personal
level
she
was
all
right
so
far
as
I
knew
her
Professionally
though
she
was
a
cheat
and
in
LA
she
got
her
come-uppance
If
it
were
possible
I
would
be
friends
with
Tessa
and
it
was
nearly
possible
Mum
was
a
fan
of
Tessa's
early
on
and
was
team
manager
when
Tessa
broke
the
British
record
in
West
Germany
Mum
was
delighted
But
later
when
she
felt
me
creeping
up
the
ranks
Tessa
began
to
throw
stones
Apart
from
everything
else
the
distance
between
our
respective
homes
is
a
barrier
Tessa
lives
in
Leeds
and
I
live
in
Essex
But
since
it
is
very
difficult
when
you
reach
a
certain
standard
to
keep
pushing
yourself
further
it
would
be
nice
occasionally
to
train
alongside
Tessa
as
I
sometimes
do
with
Verona
Perhaps
our
rivalry
is
just
in
the
nature
of
things
Maybe
neither
of
us
is
to
blame
All
those
years
Tessa
was
always
there
I
was
right
behind
her
I
experienced
her
as
a
barrier
to
overcome
But
to
her
I
must
have
been
a
nuisance
breathing
down
her
neck
And
Los
Angeles
was
looming
That
winter
though
my
training
was
hampered
somewhat
by
severe
pelvic
pain
The
doctor
diagnosed
fibroids
growths
on
my
womb
which
had
to
be
cauterised
When
that
didn't
quite
work
I
went
back
for
a
second
cauterisation
and
I
was
recovering
nicely
Then
just
two
weeks
before
I
had
to
depart
for
the
Games
I
had
to
go
in
and
have
the
fibroids
cauterised
for
a
third
time
I
felt
weak
and
a
little
wobbly
The
doctor
told
my
mother
it
was
not
advisable
for
me
to
compete
in
the
Olympics
It
was
too
soon
Mum
said
it
would
have
to
be
my
decision
I
wanted
desperately
to
go
to
Los
Angeles
So
I
decided
to
disobey
doctor's
orders
Even
if
it
didn't
help
my
fibroid
condition
one
bit
I
knew
I
had
to
have
a
go
I
tried
to
keep
secret
the
fact
that
I
had
had
a
third
fibroid
operation
so
near
to
the
Games
But
the
News
of
the
World
printed
the
story
In
hindsight
perhaps
by
going
to
LA
I
did
the
wrong
thing
I
did
have
a
lot
of
trouble
afterwards
until
January
of
the
next
year
It
has
never
been
reported
in
the
press
But
because
of
Helsinki
I
was
down
as
the
favourite
according
to
the
British
press
They
said
I
had
a
good
chance
at
winning
gold
Also
I
was
throwing
better
than
Tessa
Sanderson
No
one
had
any
hope
for
Tessa
The
press
kept
ignoring
her
and
interviewing
me
Tessa
I
hear
was
not
pleased
especially
when
it
was
reported
that
her
Olympic
prospects
were
nil
or
poor
The
British
press
who
had
reported
her
career
so
vociferously
felt
it
was
ending
Now
the
press
had
their
eyes
on
me
They
felt
I
was
on
my
way
up
and
she
on
her
way
down
Tessa
was
twenty-eight
five
years
older
than
I
was
but
her
age
was
no
disadvantage
Javelin
throwers
mature
like
wine
My
only
edge
was
that
I
was
getting
better
with
every
throw
After
those
thorny
European
Championships
in
Athens
I
replaced
her
as
the
British
number
one
in
the
javelin
rankings
a
spot
she
had
held
unchallenged
for
a
decade
I
knew
I
had
a
reasonable
chance
at
a
medal
even
in
my
weakened
state
and
knew
I
would
never
forgive
myself
if
I
put
the
Olympics
on
hold
for
another
four
years
Tessa
was
going
despite
the
fact
that
the
press
had
told
her
to
her
face
that
she
was
past
it
This
was
unfair
Even
I
felt
sympathy
Because
at
the
height
of
her
career
in
Tessa
had
failed
to
qualify
for
the
Moscow
Olympic
final
now
some
of
the
tabloid
toughies
suggested
that
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
Tessa
would
fail
in
LA
But
I
knew
she
had
been
training
hard
and
she
had
a
lot
of
bulk
on
her
a
lot
of
muscle
She
was
two
inches
taller
than
me
and
on
the
eve
of
the
Olympic
final
for
which
both
of
us
had
qualified
she
outweighed
me
by
a
stone
I
had
to
give
her
credit
She
was
all
muscle
LA
the
smog
capital
of
the
world
was
choking
nearly
as
hot
as
Athens
and
more
humid
Physically
the
weather
was
annoying
Technically
it
was
fascinating
Because
humidity
expands
the
javelin
and
gives
it
lift
that
high
humidity
could
particularly
if
there
was
a
little
wind
make
for
record-shattering
throws
But
the
final
was
not
until
early
evening
when
the
stadium
had
cooled
off
Not
a
lot
mind
you
just
a
bit
There
was
a
hint
of
a
breeze
I
knew
that
my
throw
would
have
to
be
high
and
dead
centre
to
float
the
javelin
on
so
tepid
a
current
of
air
This
time
to
my
amazement
it
was
Tessa
who
threw
down
the
gauntlet
on
her
first
throw
Running
fast
holding
the
javelin
high
she
hurled
it
hard
I
could
see
at
once
from
the
angle
of
release
that
it
would
be
a
long
throw
But
would
it
be
long
enough
to
do
any
damage
The
javelin
plopped
to
the
ground
at
the
metre
mark
That
was
impressive
I
was
excited
for
Tessa
honestly
I
also
felt
a
twinge
of
sadness
Then
I
remembered
I
had
five
more
rounds
to
beat
it
So
did
the
world
champion
Tiina
Lillak
who
now
held
her
second
world
javelin
record
and
who
was
at
the
time
without
a
doubt
the
best
thrower
of
the
three
of
us
But
Tiina
who
was
walking
gingerly
was
suffering
from
a
stress
fracture
of
her
foot
which
was
disastrous
for
her
run-up
In
the
second
round
I
inched
closer
with
metres
still
no
danger
at
all
Then
Tiina
gritted
her
teeth
and
let
go
a
knockout
throw
which
landed
just
short
of
victory
at
One
more
and
she
might
have
made
it
but
Tiina
had
made
her
ankle
hurt
and
took
no
more
throws
I
kept
trying
On
my
fifth
throw
I
moved
into
bronze
medal
position
with
I
had
felt
weak
throughout
the
competition
There
was
only
one
more
throw
I
knew
I
had
to
make
it
count
To
be
perfectly
honest
I
didn't
mind
losing
to
Tiina
a
great
champion
in
her
prime
but
I
hated
the
idea
of
losing
at
this
late
date
to
Tessa
Sanderson
The
floodlights
went
on
in
the
stadium
The
crowd
was
as
tense
as
I
was
even
though
it
was
an
American
crowd
and
there
was
no
American
in
the
running
Holding
the
javelin
aloft
I
ran
with
it
and
let
it
go
But
at
the
moment
I
let
go
I
knew
it
was
not
the
throw
I
wanted
It
would
fall
short
Tessa
was
the
Olympic
champion
Not
only
had
she
set
an
Olympic
record
she
had
become
the
first
British
woman
and
the
first
black
woman
of
any
nationality
to
win
an
Olympic
throwing
event
A
disappointed
Tiina
had
won
silver
I
had
to
make
do
with
bronze
There
was
no
way
I
could
feel
delighted
I
could
not
help
myself
I
cried
again
with
the
cameras
watching
But
that
was
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
Pulling
myself
together
I
went
out
and
congratulated
Tessa
Her
achievement
was
tremendous
and
my
own
was
not
dreadfully
bad
I
was
now
an
Olympian
My
bronze
medal
would
always
be
there
in
the
Olympic
annals
Later
as
Tessa
Tiina
and
I
stood
together
on
the
victory
podium
medals
hanging
like
necklaces
around
our
necks
the
sound
of
our
national
anthem
being
played
and
seeing
Tessa
crying
touched
me
I
just
had
to
reach
up
and
give
her
a
little
tweak
on
the
cheek
Touching
her
cheek
like
that
spontaneously
was
a
gesture
of
affection
An
accolade
We
were
both
Brits
we
had
known
each
other
a
long
time
Her
joy
her
big
smile
brighter
than
a
toothpaste
advert
was
contagious
At
that
moment
I
felt
happy
for
her
But
even
as
Tessa
cried
for
joy
Tiina's
disappointment
brimmed
over
and
tears
streamed
down
her
cheek
That
reminded
me
of
my
own
disappointment
I
had
wanted
gold
If
I
hadn't
had
to
have
that
third
operation
so
close
to
the
Olympics
who
knows
what
would
have
happened
Similarly
if
Tiina
hadn't
been
injured
and
if
the
East
Germans
hadn't
boycotted
the
Olympics
if
Petra
Felke
had
been
there
what
would
the
outcome
have
been
But
sport
is
about
who
is
best
on
the
day
It
had
been
Tessa's
day
I
would
just
have
to
wait
for
another
chance
four
years
until
the
next
Olympics
in
Seoul
in
Four
years
seemed
a
long
time
to
me
but
I
had
no
idea
that
such
a
lot
could
happen
in
the
interim
In
when
Tessa
and
I
competed
for
the
first
time
after
the
Olympics
at
Gateshead
I
easily
beat
her
by
almost
feet
with
a
throw
of
feet
inches
metres
But
after
the
javelin
competition
verbal
darts
began
to
fly
We
had
been
friendly
rivals
now
there
was
a
lot
of
nastiness
There
were
the
ups
and
downs
of
competition
after
that
mostly
ups
Then
something
entirely
unpredictable
something
terrible
happened
in
December

twenty-nine
Carry
Ons
I
only
did
nine
yet
I'm
always
remembered
as
the
Carry
On
Girl
By
the
time
I
joined
the
Carry
On
team
Kenneth
Williams
Sid
James
Charles
Hawtrey
Kenneth
Connor
Hattie
Jacques
and
Joan
Sims
were
firm
favourites
with
the
British
public
They
were
cartoon
characters
really
like
the
fat
ladies
and
weedy
men
in
the
traditional
seaside
postcards
I
was
to
become
the
busty
floozy
who
tempts
the
weedy
man
away
from
his
portly
spouse
It
was
innocent
titillation
with
emphasis
on
the
tit!
My
break
came
quite
by
chance
Ronald
Fraser
who
I'd
met
on
Crooks
in
Cloisters
invited
me
to
Pinewood
Studios
for
lunch
while
he
was
making
a
film
called
The
Beauty
Jungle
Pinewood's
restaurant
I
must
tell
you
is
quite
palatial
all
wood
panels
and
chandeliers
I'd
arranged
to
meet
Ronnie
Fraser
in
the
bar
which
is
at
the
far
end
of
the
restaurant
As
I
walked
through
the
restaurant
I
never
guessed
I
was
under
surveillance
by
the
producer
and
director
of
the
Carry
On
series
Peter
Rogers
and
Gerald
Thomas
who
were
looking
for
a
bubbly
blonde
to
replace
Liz
Fraser
Barbara
isn't
a
sex
symbol
Peter
Rogers
said
she's
a
body
a
bosom
and
a
joke
Thanks
a
lot
Peter
Anyway
I
got
the
job
The
Carry
On
scene
everyone
remembers
is
where
I
lost
my
bikini
top
in
Carry
On
Camping
It
was
mid-November
freezing
cold
and
pouring
with
rain
We
were
all
ankle-deep
in
mud
Just
to
add
to
our
misery
the
special-effects
people
sprayed
the
mud
green
to
make
it
look
like
summer
time
I
can't
go
on
like
this
I
told
Gerald
Thomas
Look
at
my
feet
They're
sinking!
I
wouldn't
be
employing
you
if
they
were
looking
at
your
feet
he
replied
I
took
my
place
in
the
line-up
of
girls
representing
the
Chaste
Place
Finishing
School
for
Young
Ladies
We
were
doing
keep-fit
exercises
under
the
supervision
of
our
PT
instructor
Kenneth
Williams
Come
along
Barbara
stretch
out
your
arms
and
fling
and
in
and
fling
and
in
and
oooh!
My
bikini
top
unable
to
take
the
strain
any
longer
burst
at
the
back
whizzed
through
the
air
and
wrapped
itself
round
Kenny's
mush
But
of
course
in
reality
that
didn't
happen
of
its
own
accord
A
fishing
line
was
attached
to
my
bikini
top
while
Bert
an
elderly
prop
man
wielded
the
rod
You
can
just
imagine
them
breaking
the
news
to
him
Ere
Bert
we
want
you
to
take
Barbara
Windsor's
bra
off!
As
the
cameras
rolled
Bert
jerked
the
rod
and
started
to
reel
in
My
top
didn't
budge
Stop
Bert
stop!
I
shouted
but
he
must
have
been
hard
of
hearing
because
he
kept
on
reeling
in
and
I
was
dragged
through
the
mud
on
my
arse
Covered
from
head
to
toe
in
mud
and
freezing
cold
I
could
hear
Gerald
rapping
out
his
orders
Get
er
up
and
mop
er
down
Let's
go
for
another
take!
We
had
no
choice
but
to
get
on
with
it
When
at
last
we'd
got
it
right
I
joined
Kenny
as
we
paddled
our
way
back
to
our
trailers
Kenny
started
winding
me
up
It's
a
disgrace
It's
an
absolute
disgrace!
I
could
contain
my
rage
no
longer
They
treat
you
like
a
load
of
shit
We've
never
had
a
rise
I
tell
you
I'll
never
make
another
Carry
On
film!
Quite
right
duckie
said
Kenny
Next
day
we
saw
the
rushes
And
of
course
they
looked
great
As
the
screen
darkened
and
we
got
up
to
leave
I
heard
my
voice
loud
and
clear
I
could
feel
my
face
changing
colour
They
treat
you
like
a
load
of
Everything
I'd
said
the
previous
day
was
on
tape!
Kenny
had
forgotten
to
switch
off
the
microphone
round
his
neck
or
that's
what
he
said
When
I
arrived
for
my
next
film
Gerald
said
Who's
treating
you
like
a
load
of
shit
then
When
we'd
started
making
Carry
On
Camping
I'd
tried
to
get
away
from
my
chirpy
Cockney
image
I
played
a
rebellious
pupil
at
the
Chaste
Place
school
for
girls
and
my
opening
scene
took
place
in
the
shower
room
I
was
meant
to
spy
a
peeping
tom
through
a
hole
in
the
cubicle
wall
and
squirt
toothpaste
into
the
hole
shouting
Get
away
you
filthy
snooper!
In
the
rehearsal
I
used
a
well-bred
sort
of
voice
but
things
turned
out
differently
when
we
came
to
shoot
it
As
soon
as
I
saw
this
bulging
eyeball
ogling
me
I
drew
back
and
screamed
Get
aht
of
it
you
dirty
snooper
in
my
coarsest
accent
From
then
on
I
was
lumbered
with
the
old
Windsor
rasp
I
said
to
Kenny
Williams
Oh
blimey
I
meant
to
play
it
posh!
I
always
hated
having
to
strip
off
You'd
never
believe
how
quickly
word
got
around
when
we
were
filming
a
saucy
scene
One
minute
there
was
a
handful
of
technicians
the
next
it
was
like
a
football
match
with
everyone
jostling
for
position
It
reached
a
point
where
I
had
to
demand
a
closed
set
Out
you
go
fellas
I'd
say
Nothing
came
undone
until
I
was
convinced
only
the
director
and
the
cameraman
remained
On
one
occasion
when
I'd
finished
my
little
strip
I
happened
to
look
up
and
there
perched
in
the
rafters
was
a
technician
He'd
climbed
up
feet
just
to
get
a
bird's
eye
view
of
my
boobs
I
hope
it
was
worth
it!
When
we
were
filming
Carry
on
Henry
I
had
to
drop
my
dressing
gown
for
a
rear
view
shot
and
I
was
making
my
usual
big
thing
about
clearing
the
set
Sid
James
had
a
go
at
Terry
Scott
for
lingering
Come
on
you
have
some
respect
he
said
As
I
came
off
shaking
from
having
had
to
flash
my
left
buttock
I
met
a
hairdresser
from
the
neighbouring
set
where
Ken
Russell
was
making
The
Devils
He
said
they
were
doing
some
pretty
spicy
stuff
orgies
and
the
like
and
he
took
me
along
to
see
what
was
going
on
I
peeped
on
to
the
set
it
was
full
of
technicians
cameramen
carpenters
a
donkey
and
a
monk
having
a
wank
under
his
cowl
And
there
was
Vanessa
Redgrave
stretched
out
on
a
slab
with
the
lights
full
on
Vanessa
didn't
bat
an
eyelid
and
a
moment
later
she
was
breezing
past
saying
I've
got
to
fetch
Jolyon
from
school
Stripping
wasn't
the
only
hazard
facing
me
I
was
Dick
Turpin's
sidekick
in
Carry
On
Dick
so
I
had
to
ride
a
horse
I
was
terrified
of
horses
and
I
couldn't
stand
sitting
astride
them
I
hated
the
feel
of
it
between
my
legs
The
director
said
Can
you
ride
I
said
Yes
let's
do
it
Don't
let's
rehearse
let's
just
do
it!
You
can
still
see
the
fear
in
my
eyes
In
Carry
On
Girls
I
made
the
mistake
of
telling
Gerald
Thomas
I
could
ride
a
motorbike
As
I
stood
in
all
the
black
leather
clobber
waiting
for
the
director
to
shout
Action!
Sid
James
asked
me
if
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
Course
I
do
it's
like
riding
a
bicycle
isn't
it
You
just
get
on
and
drive
off
Gawd
it's
got
gears
and
everything
You've
got
a
lot
of
bottle
you
have
It
was
a
bit
silly
I
suppose
but
I
don't
like
people
knowing
I
can't
do
something
I'd
rather
hurt
myself
than
admit
defeat
I
knew
if
I
started
thinking
about
it
I
would
have
time
to
get
nervous
I
got
on
the
bike
shoved
it
into
gear
and
headed
straight
for
a
thick
mattress
Sid
had
had
set
up
for
me
Another
scene
in
Carry
On
Girls
had
me
pushing
one
of
my
rivals
for
a
beauty
contest
off
a
donkey
and
having
a
proper
old
wrestling
match
At
the
end
of
the
day's
filming
we'd
only
got
half
the
shot
and
the
donkey
had
crapped
everywhere
In
the
morning
I
said
You
don't
expect
me
to
roll
around
in
all
that!
It's
got
to
stay
for
continuity
said
Gerald
Sod
the
continuity!
But
of
course
it
stayed
The
Carry
Ons
only
had
a
six-week
shooting
schedule
so
there
was
never
any
time
to
waste
It
was
a
running
joke
at
Pinewood
that
by
the
end
of
the
first
day's
shooting
we'd
be
an
hour
ahead
of
schedule
and
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
we'd
be
a
whole
week
ahead
Gerald
seldom
allowed
more
than
two
takes
It
wasn't
Shakespeare
nobody
analysed
what
they
were
doing
they
just
did
it
We
had
to
be
there
early
know
the
script
backwards
cause
no
aggravations
and
endure
all
kinds
of
awful
weather
in
order
to
finish
on
time
It
was
like
going
back
to
school
The
camaraderie
among
the
team
was
great
though
I
can
picture
them
all
sitting
around
on
the
set
in
between
takes
Sid
would
be
playing
poker
with
the
technicians
Charlie
would
sit
by
himself
smoking
his
Woodbines
Hattie
would
do
The
Times
crossword
and
the
others
would
gather
round
Kenny
as
he
held
court
Did
you
hear
the
one
about
the
Canon
with
no
balls
he'd
say
He'd
tell
the
same
stories
over
and
over
but
he'd
always
find
a
new
way
of
telling
it
and
making
it
hilarious
again
Then
sometimes
he'd
try
to
embarrass
me
about
my
latest
boyfriend
What's
the
size
of
his
cock
he'd
say
or
Do
you
do
everything
And
then
do
you
have
to
have
it
off
with
Ronnie
when
you
get
ome
He
was
always
teasing
me
He
used
to
say
Ooooh
Windsor
you
smell
so
loveleee!
Once
during
filming
he
even
claimed
I
gave
him
an
erection
Oooh
she's
given
me
the
arf
ard!
he
said
to
the
technicians
As
much
as
I
loved
Kenny
Williams
I'd
have
to
say
Charles
Hawtry
was
the
best
comic
of
the
team
His
timing
was
immaculate
It
must
have
been
all
those
years
he
spent
making
films
with
Will
Hay
Like
most
of
my
Carry
On
mates
I
met
Charlie
for
the
first
time
on
Carry
On
Spying
As
spies
we
were
captured
and
held
over
a
vat
of
boiling
oil
to
make
us
divulge
our
identities
There
were
doubles
and
stand-ins
on
call
but
Gerald
preferred
us
to
do
our
own
stunts
It
was
a
tricky
scene
to
do
and
when
I'd
unstrapped
myself
I
looked
behind
me
to
say
something
to
Charlie
Gawd
he's
fainted!
I
yelled
We
got
him
down
and
saw
that
his
eyes
were
glazed
and
he
was
white
as
a
sheet
Brandy
get
him
some
brandy
You're
joking
exclaimed
Gerald
That's
what's
done
it
the
bleedin
brandy!
I
didn't
know
Charlie
had
a
drink
problem
did
I
I
soon
learned
though
We
came
to
know
when
he
was
pissed
he'd
be
very
grand
arriving
with
his
chauffeur
carrying
a
crate
of
R
White's
lemonade
There
were
always
one
or
two
occasions
on
every
film
when
he
got
really
pie-eyed
and
would
pass
out
When
that
happened
they
would
shoot
round
him
An
hour
or
so
later
Charlie
would
come
round
and
throw
up
Once
I
took
over
a
bucket
when
he
was
throwing
up
in
a
corner
everyone
else
was
ignoring
it
But
Charlie
seemed
to
resent
it
Oh
why
don't
you
piss
off
he
said
you're
always
trying
to
be
so
kind
and
good
to
everyone
It
was
so
sad
to
see
this
wonderful
comic
actor
who
I
admired
so
much
ruining
his
life
with
booze
Charlie
had
a
hard
time
looking
after
his
mother
who
suffered
from
senile
dementia
He
brought
her
to
the
studios
every
day
and
looked
after
her
like
a
baby
He
used
to
lock
her
in
the
dressing
room
when
he
was
required
on
set
One
day
he
forgot
to
turn
the
key
and
she
got
out
We
were
coming
back
from
a
take
and
we
could
hear
this
rasping
voice
echoing
through
the
corridors
Have
you
seen
my
Charlie
I've
got
his
tea
ready
and
he
hasn't
come
home
from
school
yet!
We
turned
a
corner
and
there
was
Charlie's
old
mum
quizzing
Sir
John
Gielgud
Sadly
Charlie
misbehaved
once
too
often
and
as
a
consequence
he
was
never
used
again
We
had
some
members
of
the
public
on
the
set
during
a
scene
in
which
Joan
and
Kenny
were
in
bed
together
I
think
they
were
quite
shocked
to
hear
Kenny
passing
wind
rather
loudly
How
dare
you!
exclaimed
Joan
How
do
you
expect
an
actress
to
work
with
you
doing
things
like
that!
I'll
have
you
know
Rudolph
Valentino
used
to
fart
and
his
leading
ladies
never
dared
complain
said
Kenny
Joan
said
Yes
but
they
were
silent
movies
I'm
sure
the
visitors
thought
it
was
all
part
of
the
script
You
didn't
choose
Kenny
as
a
friend
he
chose
you
I
felt
very
privileged
to
be
numbered
among
his
closest
friends
He
always
used
to
say
he
liked
me
because
I
was
the
only
one
of
the
Carry
On
team
who
cleaned
her
teeth
after
lunch!
He
had
some
funny
ways
You
couldn't
phone
him
between
nine
and
ten
because
that
was
when
he
was
doing
his
ablutions
or
cleaning
the
toilet
he
was
obsessed
with
his
bowels
He
had
very
few
close
friends
and
he
could
only
deal
with
us
one
at
a
time
Stanley
Baxter
who
was
a
great
friend
of
Kenny's
said
he
was
sitting
in
a
restaurant
once
when
in
walked
Kenny
with
Maggie
Smith
He
took
one
look
at
Stanley
and
said
Come
on
Maggie
we'll
go
somewhere
else
And
he
used
to
take
against
people
for
no
reason
Joan
Sims
and
he
were
great
mates
but
one
day
he
said
to
me
Joan
is
so
fucking
suburban
So
you
never
knew
quite
how
to
take
him
He
said
to
me
If
you
ever
leave
Ronnie
will
you
come
and
live
with
me
Before
I
could
open
my
mouth
he
added
Mind
you
there'd
be
no
sex!

Behind
the
Scenes
PACKED
FULL
OF
American
tourists
the
big
bus
edged
slowly
down
the
narrow
road
alongside
the
River
Thames
in
Teddington
just
outside
London
Eager
with
anticipation
faces
peered
excitedly
out
of
the
coach
windows
as
they
cruised
cautiously
down
Broom
Road
until
suddenly
the
magic
moment
was
upon
them
And
here
it
is
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
the
tour
group
courier
talking
triumphantly
into
a
microphone
with
the
air
of
a
man
about
to
arrive
at
some
hitherto
unattainable
journey's
end
He
pointed
proudly
past
a
uniformed
security
guard
on
duty
at
the
nondescript
entrance
to
what
looked
like
a
large
industrial
estate
Thames
Television
studios
home
of
the
Benny
Hill
Show
In
an
instant
the
bus
was
ablaze
with
the
flash
of
several
dozen
cameras
going
off
together
As
the
bus
slowed
the
American
visitors
scrambled
to
get
off
for
a
closer
view
of
the
studios
and
the
chance
to
take
even
more
photographs
to
show
the
envious
folks
back
home
Along
with
Buckingham
Palace
and
the
Tower
of
London
our
Teddington
studios
appear
to
be
well
and
truly
on
the
American
tourist
route
laughs
Dennis
Kirkland
producer
and
director
of
the
Benny
Hill
Show
Hampton
Court
is
only
just
up
the
road
So
they
do
that
in
the
morning
then
head
here
They
know
all
about
the
Benny
Hill
Show
from
seeing
it
on
television
in
the
States
And
they
all
want
to
see
the
very
spot
where
the
programmes
are
made
It's
almost
like
a
pilgrimage
Had
this
particular
bus-load
of
trans-Atlantic
pilgrims
not
been
so
busy
capturing
the
somewhat
featureless
scene
on
colour
film
they
might
have
noticed
a
small
sandy-haired
man
carrying
a
plastic
bag
full
of
shopping
slip
quietly
through
a
side
gate
With
a
friendly
nod
to
the
commissionaire
the
new
arrival
disappeared
quickly
through
the
main
door
smiling
slightly
to
himself
at
the
antics
of
the
Americans
who
were
now
bombarding
the
security
man
at
the
front
gate
with
questions
about
just
which
building
was
the
actual
home
of
the
Benny
Hill
Show
and
pleading
to
be
allowed
just
the
briefest
of
peeks
inside
The
man
with
the
plastic
bag
made
his
way
to
a
modest
dressing
room
in
Studio
One
dumped
his
shopping
on
the
table
and
hung
up
his
jacket
behind
the
door
From
his
pockets
he
took
a
bundle
of
handwritten
notes
scribbled
on
scraps
of
paper
Benny
Hill
was
ready
for
work
Benny's
not
the
kind
to
sweep
up
to
the
studio
in
a
huge
limousine
like
some
showbiz
superstar
explained
Dennis
Kirkland
a
former
floor
manager
who
has
been
producing
the
show
for
seven
years
and
is
one
of
Benny's
few
close
friends
Of
course
we
offer
to
lay
on
a
car
to
bring
him
out
to
Teddington
But
more
often
than
not
he
prefers
to
make
his
own
way
out
here
often
walking
the
last
few
miles
and
doing
a
bit
of
shopping
en
route
Benny's
contemporaries
in
the
entertainment
world
can
never
get
used
to
the
idea
of
Britain's
highest
paid
TV
performer
walking
to
work
There
was
a
time
when
Max
Bygraves
was
driving
to
the
studios
in
his
Rolls-Royce
when
he
saw
Benny
trudging
down
Teddington
High
Street
with
a
bag
full
of
groceries
recalls
Kirkland
an
amiable
character
in
sweater
and
jeans
Max
stopped
his
car
and
yelled
What's
the
matter
Benny
too
skint
to
afford
a
cab
While
Benny's
deliberately
low
key
arrival
to
start
making
a
new
series
may
seem
somewhat
incongruous
for
a
millionaire
entertainer
whose
programmes
are
shown
all
over
the
world
it
is
typical
of
the
workaday
beginnings
from
which
a
Benny
Hill
Show
is
produced
For
this
is
no
Hollywood-style
production
in
which
batteries
of
scriptwriters
and
assorted
ideas
men
sit
earnestly
closeted
for
months
on
end
dreaming
up
new
material
for
The
Star
Producer
Kirkland
well
remembers
that
the
origins
of
one
Benny
Hill
Show
lay
in
the
arrival
on
his
desk
of
a
dog-eared
piece
of
cardboard
covered
with
what
looked
like
Egyptian
hieroglyphics
It
was
one
of
those
cardboard
stiffeners
you
get
inside
a
new
shirt
Dennis
recalled
And
it
was
smothered
with
almost
incomprehensible
scribbles
in
Benny's
handwriting
which
is
not
very
good
at
the
best
of
times
At
first
we
thought
it
was
some
kind
of
secret
code
but
then
we
deciphered
a
note
from
Benny
scrawled
down
the
side
It
explained
that
he
had
been
sitting
outside
a
cafe
in
Madrid
when
he
suddenly
got
this
idea
for
a
sketch
about
a
Chinese
waiter
What
Chinese
waiters
have
got
to
do
with
Spain
we
never
did
discover
Anyway
when
Benny
got
back
to
his
hotel
he
wrote
it
all
down
on
this
piece
of
cardboard
and
stuck
it
in
the
post
The
dialogue
was
all
this
jokey
flied
lice
lookeee-lookeee-me-no-likeee
Chinese
chat
which
is
why
we
had
such
a
job
unscrambling
it
In
the
end
we
managed
to
make
some
sense
of
it
And
it
turned
into
a
brilliant
sketch
Benny's
impulsive
habit
of
writing
down
an
idea
as
soon
as
it
strikes
him
has
resulted
in
numerous
notions
arriving
at
the
Teddington
studios
jotted
down
on
anything
from
a
Malaysian
restaurant
menu
to
a
Bangkok
beer
mat
He'll
scribble
something
down
on
a
cigarette
packet
and
send
THAT
to
me
if
he
can't
find
anything
else
to
write
on
says
Dennis
and
he
always
carries
a
newspaper
with
him
so
he
can
scribble
in
the
margins
Such
ideas
are
buzzing
through
Benny's
brain
months
before
a
new
show
goes
into
production
Some
of
his
best
material
is
dreamed
up
while
he
is
sitting
outside
a
Continental
cafe
on
holiday
surveying
the
passing
scene
The
antics
of
a
strolling
guitarist
in
Spain
or
a
harassed
gendarme
in
Paris
could
well
provide
the
inspiration
for
a
sketch
which
will
eventually
end
up
on
the
TV
screen
Over
the
years
such
observations
have
given
birth
to
the
never-ending
procession
of
madcap
characters
who
march
through
the
Benny
Hill
Shows
Mr
Chow
Mein
the
sirry
irriot
Chinaman
gives
way
to
Mervyn
Cruddy
the
perennial
talk
show
bore
Professor
Otto
Stumpf
the
old
Bavarian
buffer
inspired
by
Benny's
wartime
service
in
Germany
is
followed
by
Pierre
de
Terre
the
avant-garde
French
film
director
A
white-coated
Scottish
doctor
with
a
meandering
mind
lectures
earnestly
on
the
vagaries
of
the
human
race
I
once
knew
a
native
girl
All
she
wore
was
beads
and
eight
of
them
were
perspiration
She
didn't
tell
me
she
had
a
glass
eye
it
came
out
in
conversation
Her
feet
were
so
big
she
had
to
go
to
the
crossroads
to
turn
round
The
bowler-hatted
loon
extolling
the
benefits
of
a
nice
genital
way
of
life
is
replaced
by
a
straw-chewing
village
idiot
intoning
They've
got
a
new
vicar
up
at
St
Paul's
He
don't
half
talk
a
lot
of
nonsense
In
between
the
brave
boys
of
the
Lower
Tidmarsh
Fire
Brigade
rescue
scantily
clad
maidens
from
burning
buildings
and
a
choir
of
singing
railway
porters
steam
their
way
through
Widdicombe
Fair
old
Uncle
Tom
Cobblers
and
all
And
at
every
turn
is
the
ubiquitous
Fred
Scuttle
constantly
at
our
service
with
his
peaked
cap
crazily
askew
eager
eyes
blinking
madly
through
wire-rimmed
glasses
and
fingers
enthusiastically
splayed
in
a
ragged
salute
Fred
Scuttle
too
was
born
out
of
Benny's
military
service
he
had
to
wear
similar
little
round
glasses
as
a
driver
during
the
war
Scuttle
made
his
first
appearance
as
a
test
pilot
in
a
wheelbarrow
factory
on
one
of
Benny's
BBC
shows
in
Garnished
with
Benny's
wit
and
inventiveness
the
most
insignificant
incident
can
turn
into
an
eminently
workable
idea
for
television
On
one
occasion
Benny
was
listening
to
a
band
in
Kensington
Gardens
in
London
when
he
noticed
a
young
woman
relaxing
with
her
eyes
closed
dreamily
conducting
the
band
with
one
finger
It
gave
rise
to
a
sketch
where
everyone
in
the
park
was
playing
some
imaginary
instrument
led
by
a
conductor
with
his
eyes
closed
using
a
newspaper
as
a
baton
I'm
so
busy
scribbling
things
down
that
in
restaurants
I'm
often
mistaken
for
one
of
those
undercover
spies
from
The
Good
Food
Guide
admits
Benny
But
when
an
idea
hits
you
you
MUST
write
it
down
otherwise
it
can
go
out
of
your
head
I'm
never
without
a
pen
and
I'll
reach
for
the
nearest
scrap
of
paper
when
I
need
to
make
a
note
When
people
who
want
to
be
scriptwriters
say
to
me
I've
got
a
few
ideas
I'd
like
to
discuss
I
always
say
write
them
down
I
might
spend
hours
on
a
plane
travelling
to
Australia
But
that
doesn't
worry
me
I
take
my
exercise
books
and
on
each
line
I
write
something
If
it
takes
more
than
one
line
it's
probably
not
worth
doing
It
is
from
this
rag-bag
of
vague
ideas
partly
written
sketches
and
one-word
suggestions
for
a
few
seconds
of
visual
business
that
the
internationally
acclaimed
Benny
Hill
Show
begins
to
take
shape
Some
of
the
jokes
date
back
to
his
boyhood
remembered
from
the
days
when
his
father
used
to
take
him
to
the
music-hall
in
Southampton
and
honeymoon
sketches
were
very
much
in
vogue
Just
Married
says
the
large
label
on
bridegroom
Benny's
suitcase
in
one
of
his
TV
skits
And
Don't
You
Forget
It
reads
a
similar
label
on
the
luggage
of
his
hatchet-faced
bride
He
has
an
amazing
memory
for
gags
says
producer
Kirkland
And
he
never
wastes
anything
He
will
save
a
gag
for
years
waiting
for
the
right
slot
to
put
it
in
This
ability
to
re-cycle
material
in
different
ways
so
as
to
wring
every
last
chuckle
out
of
it
is
not
lost
on
his
professional
colleagues
Comedian
Bob
Monkhouse
who
has
no
mean
memory
for
jokes
himself
recalls
writing
for
the
radio
show
Calling
All
Forces
back
in
when
Benny
then
an
up-and-coming
comic
appeared
with
film
star
Diana
Dors
and
funnyman
Arthur
Askey
Benny
did
patter
gags
in
that
show
says
Bob
Some
years
later
I
saw
him
on
TV
delivering
the
same
series
of
jokes
in
exactly
the
same
order
only
this
time
they
were
in
a
song
He
had
taken
the
gags
and
woven
them
into
a
lyric
I
have
noticed
he
does
this
again
and
again
reworking
the
same
basic
ideas
I
have
sat
there
dumbstruck
with
admiration
at
the
switches
he
has
pulled
And
why
shouldn't
he
Good
gags
are
like
jewels
Max
Bygraves
another
entertainer
who
has
watched
Benny
develop
over
more
than
years
is
similarly
impressed
He's
a
very
fine
comedian
says
Max
What
arouses
me
is
how
he
can
keep
permutating
the
same
dozen
gags
Benny
himself
is
the
first
to
admit
that
many
of
his
jokes
are
re-worked
gems
from
the
past
Once
asked
to
reveal
his
favourite
joke
he
trotted
out
the
well-worn
tale
of
the
Member
of
Parliament
who
was
visiting
a
mental
home
and
was
amazed
to
discover
that
a
beautifully
designed
flower
bed
was
the
work
of
an
inmate
I
can't
believe
there
is
anything
mentally
wrong
with
someone
like
you
who
can
do
such
wonderful
work
the
MP
told
the
patient
I
shall
arrange
for
your
immediate
discharge
and
get
you
a
job
as
a
gardener
somewhere
outside
As
the
MP
hurried
off
to
the
hospital
offices
he
was
suddenly
knocked
almost
unconscious
by
a
brick
thrown
by
the
inmate
Don't
forget
will
you
asked
the
grinning
gardener
While
fellow
professionals
may
be
understandingly
tolerant
of
a
comic
who
can
give
old
material
a
new
shine
those
less
personally
concerned
with
the
difficulties
of
creating
new
scripts
are
not
always
so
charitable
Television
critic
Chris
Dunkley
groaned
with
displeasure
when
Benny
insisted
on
reviving
one
particular
old
chestnut
in
one
of
his
early
shows
for
Thames
Television
Writing
in
The
Times
Dunkley
commented
When
I
was
about
four
my
mother
managed
to
reduce
me
to
an
almost
hysterical
fit
of
giggling
by
promising
to
show
me
her
new
water
otter
and
then
producing
a
kettle
Benny
Hill
trotted
out
the
same
joke
in
the
first
of
his
new
series
on
Thames
and
somehow
its
age
and
weakness
almost
its
senility
seemed
to
serve
as
a
touchstone
for
the
entire
show
Yet
only
a
short
while
later
it
was
this
very
ability
to
dust
off
well-used
items
and
put
them
back
in
the
comedy
shop
window
which
intrigued
another
Times
writer
Leonard
Buckley
Benny
Hill's
routines
remain
the
same
Buckley
acknowledged
There
is
nothing
extraordinary
about
them
He
sings
He
recites
He
takes
part
in
a
sketch
Where
he
scores
is
the
inventiveness
with
which
he
invests
the
same
old
thing
When
he
comes
home
in
the
sketch
to
discover
the
other
man
he
is
at
once
a
master
of
outrage
He's
got
my
individual
fruit
pie!
When
he
comes
to
his
recitation
he
is
the
countryman
using
the
humans
to
explain
to
his
son
about
the
birds
and
the
bees
Of
course
Benny
Hill
can
be
saucy
But
it
is
all
disarmingly
done
I
don't
believe
in
that
sort
of
thing
before
marriage
and
I'm
not
sure
about
it
afterwards
either
he
told
us
primly
in
one
scene
After
that
reassurance
he
could
have
pinched
Mrs
Grundy's
bottom
and
still
have
had
her
like
the
rest
of
us
shaking
with
mirth

HIGH
SCHOOL
HIGHS
In
Howard
Stenton
Jones
set
up
home
with
Margaret
Burns
in
Stanstead
Road
Brixton
along
with
Terry
Margaret's
son
from
her
previous
marriage
We
had
a
tough
time
in
those
days
recalled
Mrs
Jones
the
post
war
years
were
no
party
for
anyone
and
we
were
no
exception
David
was
born
on
th
January
The
midwife
said
to
me
This
child
has
been
on
this
earth
before
and
I
thought
that
was
rather
an
odd
thing
to
say
but
the
midwife
seemed
quite
adamant
When
he
was
about
years
old
he
put
on
make-up
for
the
first
time
We
had
tenants
in
the
house
and
one
day
he
went
missing
upstairs
and
found
a
bag
of
lipstick
eye-liner
and
face
powder
and
decided
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
plaster
his
face
with
it
When
I
finally
found
him
he
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
clown
I
told
him
that
he
shouldn't
use
make-up
but
he
said
You
do
Mummy
I
agreed
but
pointed
out
that
it
wasn't
for
little
boys
David
was
when
he
first
went
to
school
and
not
unlike
most
mothers
Mrs
Jones
was
upset
at
not
having
him
around
the
house
He
proved
to
be
independent
even
at
this
early
age
When
his
mother
took
him
to
school
on
the
first
day
he
decided
from
then
onwards
he
could
make
his
own
way
to
school
and
didn't
hesitate
in
telling
his
mother
just
that
At
his
first
school
Stockwell
Junior
School
David
dressed
up
for
the
first
time
in
a
school
nativity
play
Mrs
Jones
recalls
I
made
him
a
robe
and
head-dress
and
his
father
made
him
a
crook
He
was
mad
about
it
he
absolutely
loved
it
it
was
then
that
we
began
to
realise
there
was
something
in
David
In
those
days
there
was
no
television
but
David
according
to
his
mother
made
the
most
of
radio
If
there
was
anything
that
caught
his
ear
he
would
tell
everyone
to
be
quiet
and
listen
and
then
fling
himself
about
to
the
music
In
those
days
we
thought
he
might
be
a
ballet
dancer
From
Stockwell
Junior
School
Davis
attended
Burnt
Ash
Primary
School
By
now
the
Jones
had
moved
to
Plaistow
Grove
Sundridge
Park
Bromley
a
small
leafy
dormitory
area
on
the
outskirts
of
London
It
was
around
this
time
that
he
met
George
Underwood
who
was
to
become
a
lifelong
friend
George
Underwood
I
don't
know
what
year
it
was
I
think
it
was
the
year
when
Tom
Hark
was
No.1
Ed
but
we
went
to
the
Isle
of
Wight
with
the
th
Bromley
Scouts
we
were
in
the
Cubs
then
It
was
a
skiffle
group
basically
We
had
a
double
bass
tea
chest/broom
handle/gut
and
a
ukelele
and
we
did
Gambling
Man
and
Cumberland
Gaol
and
a
few
of
the
old
Lonnie
Donegan
things
and
that
was
David's
first
public
appearance
on
the
Isle
of
Wight
From
what
I
remember
we
went
down
quite
well
and
it
was
the
beginning
of
quite
an
interesting
career
for
the
young
Mr
Jones
In
those
days
most
kids
listened
to
Buddy
Holly
and
followed
football
or
cricket
but
David
was
different
even
then
He
used
to
listen
to
American
Football
on
the
American
Forces
Network
and
was
so
enthused
with
it
that
he
wrote
to
the
American
Embassy
who
invited
him
to
visit
them
for
the
day
George
Underwood
It
was
all
instigated
by
David
really
because
he
had
been
listening
to
the
World
Service
on
the
radio
and
suddenly
got
the
bug
to
get
involved
in
American
Football
and
he
wrote
to
the
American
Embassy
asking
for
more
information
They
got
the
impression
that
he
was
well
into
it
but
in
fact
it
was
only
about
a
week
before
that
he'd
started
to
get
interested
I
think
it
was
the
glamour
or
the
aesthetics
of
the
American
football
player
They
made
our
football
players
look
a
bit
weak
because
of
all
the
big
shoulder
pads
and
everything
Anyway
the
Embassy
wrote
back
to
him
asking
whether
he'd
like
to
visit
I
went
along
with
him
At
the
end
of
the
day
they
presented
David
with
a
complete
baseball
outfit
padded
shoulders
football
helmet
which
he
proudly
brought
to
school
the
following
day
It
was
quite
amazing
really
because
we'd
never
seen
any
of
these
things
before
You
can
just
imagine
this
little
boy
in
the
playground
when
everyone
else
is
kicking
a
soccer
ball
dressed
with
big
padded
shoulders
and
a
helmet
and
an
American
football
it
was
quite
bizarre
really
I
think
he
was
very
much
into
the
magic
of
America
The
certain
mystique
it
had
was
much
more
than
just
Cowboys
and
Indians
on
television
He
had
a
period
that
he
went
through
just
reading
books
on
America
Even
at
that
age
he
was
listening
to
Charlie
Mingus
and
people
like
that
Not
that
I
thought
he
understood
the
music
that
much
but
it
was
the
image
of
he
people
behind
the
music
because
people
like
Charlie
Mingus
are
quite
characters
It's
quite
well
known
that
Little
Richard
was
one
of
David's
idols
but
there's
a
lot
of
other
American
people
who
interested
David
as
much
from
the
image
point
of
view
as
the
music
David's
step-brother
Terry
was
also
a
great
influence
on
David
in
the
early
years
When
David
was
Terry
was
frequenting
jazz
cellars
and
introducing
David
to
writers
like
Jack
Kerouac
and
Allen
Ginsberg
At
the
age
of
David
transferred
to
Bromley
Technical
High
School
Although
he
passed
his
plus
he
chose
to
go
to
a
technical
school
as
it
would
be
more
art
orientated
George
Underwood
I
remember
when
we
were
at
Bromley
Tech
we
would
experiment
with
telepathy
We
would
arrange
to
be
something
at
a
particular
time
in
the
evening
and
then
the
following
day
we
would
compare
our
thoughts
It
was
uncanny
how
on
so
many
occasions
our
thoughts
were
similar
Brian
Lane
schoolteacher
One
thing
I
remember
about
David
was
something
that
he
didn't
take
part
in
which
was
a
concert
held
at
the
school
in
aid
of
a
pavilion
that
was
being
put
up
by
the
parents
and
teachers
and
being
paid
for
by
them
So
popular
was
this
concert
that
there
was
no
admission
charge
only
a
collection
as
it
went
on
for
two
evenings
but
strangely
enough
David
didn't
offer
to
take
part
although
George
Underwood
did
and
he
had
a
very
popular
group
called
George
and
the
Dragons
at
the
time
However
later
David
did
come
and
see
me
to
ask
if
his
group
could
play
on
the
school
steps
at
the
PTA
f
te
which
was
to
be
held
in
the
summer
so
I
suppose
that
was
one
of
his
first
public
engagements
with
his
group
He
was
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
do
it
I
also
recall
that
at
least
on
one
or
two
occasions
he'd
dyed
his
hair
which
was
almost
unheard
of
in
the
early
s
However
some
way
or
other
it
was
always
washed
out
the
next
day
and
back
to
normal
In
common
with
most
teenagers
David
took
a
couple
of
part-time
jobs
one
riding
around
on
a
pushbike
with
a
basket
on
the
front
for
a
butcher
and
another
working
for
a
record
shop
owned
by
Vic
Furlong
George
Underwood
I
remember
how
we
used
to
hang
around
on
Saturday
listening
to
records
We'd
never
buy
anything
In
fact
it
was
from
Vic
Furlong's
shop
that
David
bought
his
first
saxaphone
He
couldn't
play
it
at
the
time
but
it
made
some
really
great
noises
When
he
saw
the
saxaphone
he
told
his
father
about
it
and
his
father
said
that
if
he
could
save
half
the
money
he
would
make
up
the
other
half
Vic
Furlong
He
was
always
a
bit
of
a
dreamer
in
that
I'd
give
him
a
job
to
do
come
back
in
about
an
hour
and
he
was
still
chatting
the
job
unfinished
so
he
had
to
go
He
was
a
nice
enough
lad
In
fact
at
the
time
I
was
involved
with
Bromley
Theatre
and
as
some
of
his
interest
lay
in
this
field
he
wanted
me
to
arrange
an
introduction
But
he
was
a
bit
of
a
dreamer
so
he
had
to
go
Having
acquired
his
first
saxaphone
David
got
in
touch
with
jazz
saxophonist
Ronnie
Ross
after
finding
his
telephone
number
in
the
phone
book
Ronnie
Ross
At
the
time
he
came
to
see
me
for
lessons
groups
like
The
Rolling
Stones
were
just
beginning
to
come
into
vogue
although
he
was
more
interested
in
jazz
and
we'd
sit
and
talk
about
jazz
and
jazz
musicians
quite
often
He
didn't
talk
about
groups
he
was
involved
with
but
I
did
know
that
he
was
playing
with
a
group
He
was
quite
an
average
sort
of
pupil
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
and
I
certainly
didn't
expect
him
to
become
what
he
is
today
George
Underwood
We
had
periods
when
we
would
bring
a
guitar
into
school
particularly
when
it
was
raining
It
was
what
you
called
a
wet
break
and
you
weren't
allowed
to
go
outside
There
was
a
stairway
leading
from
our
form
room
which
had
good
acoustics
and
we'd
sit
there
on
the
steps
and
I'd
be
playing
guitar
and
David
would
be
singing
We
did
Buddy
Holly
stuff
and
Everly
Brothers
He
was
a
good
harmonizer
and
still
is
He
was
studying
to
be
a
commercial
artist
and
when
he
was
in
Mr
Frampton's
art
class
this
was
Peter
Frampton's
father
in
his
later
tears
at
Bromley
tech
Frampton
lectured
the
form
on
how
he
would
not
tolerate
tapered
trousers
Margaret
Jones
I
remember
David
asked
me
to
get
my
dressmaker
to
taper
his
trousers
and
before
long
other
members
of
his
form
were
also
getting
me
to
taper
their
trousers
so
I
suppose
in
a
way
I
was
almost
helping
them
to
rebel
against
Mr
Frampton
George
Underwood
When
you
leave
school
you
have
to
queue
up
and
see
a
career's
officer
and
I
remember
I
was
standing
right
behind
David
in
the
queue
and
asked
him
what
sort
of
job
he
was
going
to
say
he
was
looking
for
A
saxophonist
in
a
modern
jazz
quartet
came
the
reply
The
careers
officer
offered
him
a
job
in
a
harp
factory
in
Bromley!
David
left
school
with
GCE
O
level
passes
in
Art
and
Woodwork
and
the
school
found
him
a
job
as
a
junior
with
a
commercial
art
company
The
Design
Group
Ltd
and
although
some
early
press
releases
said
that
David
was
expelled
from
school
the
record
shows
that
he
left
two
or
three
days
early
to
start
the
job
Margaret
Jones
He
only
took
the
job
for
his
father's
sake
because
his
father
thought
that
all
this
business
with
groups
and
music
could
well
be
a
passing
fad
and
that
at
least
if
he
spent
a
year
or
two
at
work
it
would
give
him
some
stable
grounding
to
fall
back
on
So
David
did
go
to
work
there
though
not
without
protest
I
can
remember
him
coming
home
and
moaning
about
his
blooming
job
and
travelling
up
and
down
on
the
train
It
was
and
as
David
started
his
new
job
Mersey
Mania
was
taking
its
stranglehold
on
the
charts
with
The
Beatles
Gerry
and
the
Pacemakers
Freddie
and
The
Dreamers
everything
with
a
Liverpudlian
accent
tasted
success
Soon
David
left
his
job
and
along
with
George
Underwood
formed
a
band
called
The
King
Bees
George
Underwood
David
was
always
a
bit
over
the
top
and
he
decided
to
write
to
John
Bloom
a
millionaire
business
saying
something
to
the
effect
Brian
Epstein
has
got
The
Beatles
but
you
can
have
us
but
Bloom
wasn't
that
interested
and
passed
his
letter
to
Les
Conn
an
agent
Les
Conn
The
problem
was
John
Bloom
didn't
know
anybody
in
the
music
business
except
myself
because
I
was
quite
well-known
at
that
time
in
Tin
Pan
Alley
Bloom
got
on
to
me
and
said
he
had
received
a
letter
from
this
young
cheeky
so-and-so
and
to
give
him
an
audition
and
see
what
he
was
like
which
I
did
and
was
quite
impressed
I
got
in
touch
with
Bloom
and
said
that
I
thought
the
guy
had
talent
and
Bloom
told
me
that
he
was
having
a
wedding
anniversary
party
in
Soho
which
is
in
the
centre
of
London
and
to
give
the
group
and
see
what
he
was
like
You
cheap-skate
I
said
what
sort
of
millionaire
are
you
You
could
at
least
give
them
about
to
pay
for
their
expense
Anyway
at
the
party
there
was
the
aristocracy
of
the
land
and
quite
a
lot
of
celebrities
and
of
course
David
and
his
group
turned
up
in
scruffy
jeans
George
Underwood
When
we
arrived
everyone
was
rather
dressed
up
and
we
wore
jeans
we
were
rather
shabby
looking
and
got
some
funny
looks
The
first
number
we
did
was
I've
Got
My
Mojo
Working
and
the
people
in
there
weren't
quite
sure
what
was
going
on
We
didn't
exactly
get
the
bird
but
they
just
couldn't
handle
it
they
didn't
know
what
sort
of
music
we
were
playing
We
were
pretty
much
trying
to
emulate
a
lot
of
the
early
black
blues
sound
With
my
guitar
I
was
trying
to
sound
like
Lightning
Hopkins
and
John
Lee
Hooker
and
people
like
this
and
we
just
thought
this
sounds
OK
and
it
didn't
sound
too
bad
at
the
time
So
we
were
doing
this
music
which
was
away
from
the
pop
stuff
that
was
around
Now
I've
Got
My
Mojo
Working
doesn't
go
down
with
everyone
but
at
that
time
there
were
a
few
people
around
who
did
like
that
kind
of
stuff
and
we
were
hopefully
appealing
to
them
Les
Conn
Well
of
course
the
people
weren't
prepared
for
that
kind
of
entertainment
and
they
all
put
their
hands
over
their
ears
and
Bloom
started
screaming
Get
them
off
they're
ruining
my
wedding
party
So
when
they'd
finished
performing
I've
Got
My
Mojo
Working
I
pointed
out
to
David
that
these
people
didn't
really
appreciate
their
music
and
David
being
the
sensitive
soul
that
he
is
burst
into
tears
I
told
him
not
to
worry
and
that
I
was
quite
impressed
and
would
be
interested
in
managing
the
band
That's
how
it
began

A
month
after
the
Serengeti
safari
the
Prince
and
the
Princess
flew
to
Klosters
for
a
skiing
holiday
It
was
their
third
trip
together
to
the
Prince's
favourite
haunt
On
the
second
day
of
the
holiday
March
the
Princess
who
had
a
severe
cold
stayed
in
the
chalet
There
had
been
heavy
snowfalls
earlier
in
the
week
but
the
weather
had
cleared
enough
for
the
steeper
runs
to
be
reopened
In
the
morning
the
Prince
accompanied
by
the
Duchess
of
York
the
Palmer-Tomkinsons
Major
Hugh
Lindsay
a
former
equerry
to
the
Queen
and
a
Swiss
policeman
Sergeant
Cadrovi
skied
on
the
Drostobel
one
of
the
most
demanding
slopes
at
Klosters
before
moving
off
to
an
even
more
testing
run
the
Gotschnawang
which
had
just
been
opened
During
the
morning
the
Duchess
had
a
heavy
fall
ending
up
in
a
stream
where
she
was
soaked
Badly
shaken
she
was
helped
to
the
bottom
of
the
run
and
thence
with
icicles
hanging
from
her
hair
was
taken
to
hospital
for
a
medical
examination
to
ensure
that
neither
she
nor
the
child
in
her
womb
had
been
damaged
She
then
joined
the
Princess
at
the
chalet
At
lunch
the
Prince's
depleted
party
was
joined
by
Bruno
Sprecher
who
as
one
of
the
most
experienced
guides
in
the
resort
had
been
hired
to
ski
with
the
Duchess
in
the
morning
With
the
Duchess
confined
to
the
chalet
the
Prince's
party
invited
him
as
a
friend
to
join
them
for
the
afternoon
They
decided
to
take
the
lift
to
the
top
station
the
Gotschnagrat
and
from
there
set
off
down
the
Haglamadd
an
exceptionally
testing
unmarked
descent
which
lay
between
the
two
runs
they
had
skied
in
the
morning
They
skied
down
to
the
entrance
to
a
steep
and
narrow
gully
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
run
hemmed
in
between
a
sheer
rockface
on
one
side
and
a
precipice
on
the
other
There
they
paused
for
breath
Suddenly
they
heard
a
great
roar
of
noise
They
looked
up
and
saw
gigantic
slabs
of
snow
each
the
size
of
a
large
room
crashing
down
towards
them
I've
never
forgotten
the
sound
of
it
the
Prince
said
later
the
whole
mountain
apparently
exploding
outwards
vast
blocks
came
crashing
down
past
us
Charlie
Palmer-Tomkinson
was
in
the
lead
He
paused
for
Sprecher
to
take
over
The
guide
shouted
Jump!
The
Prince
obeyed
instinctively
and
reached
a
ledge
on
the
other
side
of
the
gully
He
stood
there
with
Sprecher
Palmer-Tomkinson
and
the
Swiss
policeman
and
looked
round
I've
never
seen
anything
so
terrifying
in
my
life
this
maelstrom
went
past
vast
clouds
of
snow
and
I
thought
to
myself
My
God!
I
mean
the
horror
he
recalled
It
was
obvious
that
Patty
Palmer-Tomkinson
and
Hugh
Lindsay
had
been
swept
away
by
the
avalanche
In
fact
they
had
both
been
hurled
over
the
precipice
falling
vertically
feet
before
hitting
the
slope
gain
and
tumbling
a
further
feet
down
the
mountain
until
they
came
to
a
halt
buried
under
the
snow
Sprecher
was
the
first
down
the
slope
and
by
the
time
the
Prince
had
picked
his
way
round
the
slope
to
join
him
the
guide
had
already
located
Patty
Palmer-Tomkinson
and
was
giving
her
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation
He
had
a
spade
and
together
he
and
the
Prince
managed
to
work
her
free
Sprecher
then
went
off
in
earch
of
Lindsay
discovering
his
body
a
few
metres
away
but
three
feet
under
the
snow
his
skull
fractured
Meanwhile
the
Prince
worked
to
bring
Patty
Palmer-Tomkinson
back
to
consciousness
talking
to
her
murmuring
that
all
would
be
well
that
help
would
soon
be
at
hand
that
the
helicopter
was
on
the
way
Her
face
was
blue
and
she
was
cold
and
at
first
there
was
no
reaction
He
carried
on
talking
As
she
slipped
in
and
out
of
consciousness
she
could
hear
him
and
tried
to
formulate
words
in
response
but
she
was
unable
to
speak
I
was
hanging
on
every
word
it
as
like
a
lifeline
He
was
so
calm
so
conversational
The
helicopter
is
coming
You'll
be
all
right
The
Prince
who
had
remembered
that
when
Patricia
Brabourne's
life
was
in
the
balance
after
the
bomb
blast
at
killed
her
father
it
was
the
sound
of
the
doctors
talking
at
her
bedside
which
she
believed
had
saved
her
and
he
did
not
stop
talking
until
his
friend
was
lifted
on
to
the
helicopter
for
the
flight
to
the
hospital
On
arrival
she
was
rushed
into
intensive
care
critically
ill
After
the
body
of
Lindsay
had
been
recovered
the
rest
of
the
party
followed
down
the
mountain
Back
at
the
chalet
the
horror
of
what
had
happened
began
to
sink
in
Hugh
Lindsay
a
young
man
and
a
good
friend
was
suddenly
no
longer
with
them
Patty
Palmer-Tomkinson
was
on
the
critical
list
and
the
heir
to
the
throne
was
only
with
them
by
the
grace
of
God
spared
by
no
more
than
a
couple
of
seconds
In
the
confusion
Charlie
Palmer-Tomkinson
greatly
shocked
sat
in
a
corner
repeating
that
they
should
return
to
the
slopes
the
next
morning
insisting
that
is
what
Hugh
would
have
wanted
The
Prince
who
managed
to
contain
his
emotion
became
obsessed
with
the
urgent
need
to
protect
Sprecher
from
being
pilloried
by
the
media
for
leading
them
to
disaster
and
to
explain
what
had
happened
before
false
rumours
began
circulate
He
resolved
to
address
the
press
at
once
and
say
exactly
what
had
happened
Philip
Mackie
the
Prince's
press
secretary
and
Richard
Aylard
Commander
Richard
Aylard
equerry
to
Princess
of
Wales
assistant
private
secretary
and
comptroller
to
Prince
and
Princess
of
Wales
private
secretary
and
treasurer
to
Prince
of
Wales
since
who
had
recently
joined
his
staff
as
assistant
private
secretary
tried
to
divert
him
fearful
that
he
would
break
down
in
the
stress
of
the
moment
or
lose
his
temper
with
the
media
They
argued
that
any
statement
should
be
issued
by
Buckingham
Palace
Eventually
he
was
persuaded
at
least
to
put
his
statement
on
paper
before
meeting
the
press
When
the
Prince
had
finished
his
draft
statement
he
seemed
calmer
and
agreed
that
Mackie
should
read
it
out
for
the
media
at
the
airport
where
the
grim
atmosphere
was
given
a
touch
of
bathos
by
his
poor
eyesight
his
Glasgow
accent
and
the
Prince's
hurried
handwriting
However
it
was
typed
out
by
the
Duchess
of
York
on
the
flight
to
London
and
published
the
following
day
In
order
to
dispel
some
of
the
wild
and
unreasonable
rumours
which
may
have
arisen
as
a
result
of
the
tragic
accident
in
which
I
and
my
friends
were
involved
I
would
like
to
clarify
a
few
points
Firstly
I
would
like
to
emphasise
that
all
the
members
of
my
party
including
myself
were
skiing
off
the
piste
at
our
own
risk
We
all
accepted
and
always
have
done
that
the
mountains
have
to
be
treated
with
the
greatest
respect
and
not
treated
lightly
There
is
a
special
dimension
to
skiing
off
the
piste
which
is
hard
to
describe
to
those
who
may
not
have
experienced
it
or
may
not
wish
to
My
friend
Major
Hugh
Lindsay
who
so
tragically
died
in
this
appalling
accident
shared
these
feelings
to
the
full
and
also
understood
that
there
is
inevitably
a
risk
involved
Avalanches
are
a
natural
phenomenon
of
the
mountains
and
when
it
comes
to
avoiding
them
no
one
is
infallible
I
would
like
to
stress
that
Herr
Sprecher
behaved
throughout
in
the
most
exemplary
fashion
and
was
instrumental
in
saving
Mrs
Palmer-Tomkillson's
life
Not
only
is
he
a
friend
of
mine
but
by
the
way
in
which
he
operated
he
did
honour
to
the
noble
profession
of
which
he
is
a
member
We
shall
always
be
grateful
to
him
Before
he
left
Klosters
the
Prince
went
to
see
Patty
Palmer-Tomkinson
She
was
still
in
intensive
care
her
breathing
supported
by
a
ventilator
She
had
multiple
fractures
to
her
thighs
her
knees
her
lower
legs
and
ankles
but
her
neck
and
her
back
had
been
spared
serious
injury
She
would
remain
in
hospital
for
many
weeks
to
undergo
major
surgery
after
which
it
was
presumed
she
would
be
confined
to
a
wheel-chair
indefinitely
However
she
was
no
longer
on
the
danger
list
A
week
later
the
Prince
returned
to
Klosters
to
see
how
his
friend
was
progressing
He
had
thought
to
escape
into
the
high
peaks
with
Charlie
Palmer-Tomkinson
for
the
silence
and
for
reflection
but
Mackie
a
sharp-minded
if
prosaic
Scotsman
had
told
them
bluntly
that
to
be
seen
wearing
skis
would
be
interpreted
not
as
the
act
of
communion
they
craved
but
as
evidence
of
callousness
towards
their
dead
comrade
His
view
prevailed
To
the
lasting
dismay
of
all
those
affected
the
facts
of
the
disaster
were
persistently
to
be
distorted
In
what
appears
to
have
been
a
conscious
effort
to
damage
the
Prince
he
was
widely
accused
of
leading
his
party
down
a
closed
run
despite
warnings
to
stay
clear
and
thus
to
blame
for
causing
the
tragedy
that
followed
On
March
the
Sun
headline
read
ACCUSED
Official
Charles
DID
cause
the
killer
avalanche
Among
many
others
making
similar
points
James
Whitaker
writing
five
years
later
in
Diana
V
Charles
stated
that
after
pushing
his
party
to
go
down
an
off-piste
run
when
there
were
clear
signs
warning
them
not
to
Charles
was
forced
to
take
responsibility
for
the
tragedy
that
followed
p.154
The
truth
was
otherwise
there
were
no
warning
signs
and
the
run
was
not
closed
The
five-page
official
report
by
the
Public
Prosecutor
of
Graubunden
confirmed
the
findings
of
the
Federal
Institute
for
Snow
and
Avalanche
Research
at
Davos
that
the
group
had
disturbed
the
blanket
of
snow
that
triggered
off
the
valanche
and
that
on
the
day
of
the
accident
the
avalanche
bulletin
warned
of
a
considerable
local
avalanche
danger
in
the
region
where
they
were
skiing
Nonetheless
the
Chief
of
the
Parsenn
service
responible
for
the
safety
of
the
marked
and
controlled
pistes
at
Klosters
had
thought
it
safe
after
blast
tests
to
open
both
the
Drostobel
and
the
lift
to
the
top
station
The
prosecutor
thought
it
possible
that
the
continuation
of
blasting
led
the
group
to
assess
wrongly
the
danger
on
the
Haglamadd
which
however
had
not
been
tested
as
it
lies
outside
the
area
controlled
by
the
Parsenn
service
Exonerating
Sprecher
from
any
liability
the
report
found
that
as
no
single
member
of
the
party
had
an
explicit
leadership
role
it
was
the
task
of
each
single
member
to
assess
the
dangers
and
carry
the
responsibility
for
himself
The
prosecutor
also
ruled
out
culpable
negligence
The
party
formed
a
group
of
experienced
risk-conscious
skiers
practising
the
sport
at
its
extreme
demands
practically
equally
skilled
skiers
who
had
joined
for
descents
on
territory
well
known
to
them
and
who
made
a
personal
decision
to
ski
on
the
fatal
slope
thereby
consciously
accepting
the
inherent
risk
The
case
was
closed
and
the
state
treasury
ordered
to
bear
the
costs
of
the
investigation
The
decision
by
the
Prince
and
the
Palmer-Tomkinsons
to
return
to
Klosters
in
subsequent
years
was
cruelly
misinterpreted
by
some
commentators
one
of
whom
asserted
that
the
Princess
of
Wales
had
been
appalled
by
this
evidence
of
her
husband's
insensitivity
Whitaker
wrote
that
Diana
told
Hugh's
widow
Sarah
who
was
pregnant
when
he
died
that
she
would
never
set
foot
in
Klosters
again
yet
Prince
Charles
was
In
reality
the
Prince
and
the
Palmer-Tomkinsons
found
it
impossible
to
expunge
the
memory
of
what
had
happened
and
whenever
they
met
the
conversation
came
back
to
Klosters
We
all
agreed
that
we
could
never
go
anywhere
else
Patty
Palmer-Tomkinson
was
to
recall
with
some
emotion
We
don't
want
to
walk
away
from
it
we
don't
want
to
forget
it
and
it's
very
important
that
we
go
back
every
year
and
remember
it
It's
not
the
reason
for
going
back
it
is
one
of
the
reasons
It
would
have
been
like
turning
our
back
on
him
and
leaving
him
there
We
can't
ski
together
the
three
of
us
without
remembering

SELFHOOD
POETRY
AND
MUSIC
In
the
year
in
which
they
met
Layton
had
two
books
of
poetry
published
he
does
nothing
by
halves!
and
Leonard
was
clearly
dazzled
by
the
man's
prolific
genius
When
it
mattered
Leonard
was
a
learner
he
could
sit
at
a
man's
feet
and
absorb
completely
In
Layton
he
saw
the
splendour
and
the
viability
of
the
poetic
destiny
A
life
in
art
began
to
make
real
sense
Unlike
his
rabbinic
forebears
who
were
not
allowed
to
use
the
Torah
as
an
axe
to
earn
their
keep
from
its
knowledge
and
application
this
was
a
m
tier
which
both
claimed
him
and
offered
a
fulfilling
vocation
His
questions
flared
fast
and
furious
As
Layton
emphasised
theirs
was
the
Jewish
tradition
of
the
Lehrer
the
teacher/learner
relationship
In
amiable
mood
one
day
Leonard
remarked
of
his
friend
I
taught
him
how
to
dress
he
taught
me
how
to
live
forever
And
so
began
this
friendship
of
years
between
the
older
and
the
younger
man
Layton
is
years
senior
to
Leonard
between
the
master
and
the
apprentice
Whenever
Layton
had
a
promotional
tour
or
appearance
a
poetry
reading
or
a
workshop
poetry-reading
in
Canada
predated
Ginsberg's
sensation
with
Howl
that
set
in
motion
the
beat-poetry
style
despite
Scobie
arguing
it
as
an
influence
on
Leonard's
background
he
would
take
Leonard
along
acquaint
him
with
the
nuts
and
bolts
of
the
business
and
get
him
to
read
some
of
his
own
poetry
And
they
had
such
fun
together!
On
one
occasion
they
were
so
preoccupied
with
their
discussion
driving
from
Montreal
to
Toronto
that
they
failed
to
notice
how
low
in
petrol
they
had
become
Too
late!
They
ran
out
of
petrol
some
miles
from
their
destination
fortunately
near
to
some
houses
whose
occupants
came
to
their
rescue
Two
years
later
incredibly
the
very
same
thing
happened
at
the
very
same
spot
Only
the
discussion
had
changed!
Nothing
captures
this
profound
relationship
like
Leonard's
poem
Last
Dance
At
The
Four
Penny
The
Spice-Box
Of
Earth
pp
which
perfectly
catches
the
way
they
could
cock
a
snook
at
the
establishment
scholarly
and
religious
Layton
when
we
dance
our
Freilach
Under
the
ghostly
handkerchief
the
miracle
rabbis
of
Prague
and
Vilna
resume
their
sawdust
thrones
and
angels
and
men
asleep
so
long
in
the
cold
palaces
of
disbelief
gather
in
sausage-hung
kitchens
to
quarrel
deliciously
and
debate
the
sounds
of
the
Ineffable
Name
Layton
my
friend
Lazarovitch
no
Jew
was
ever
lost
while
we
two
dance
joyously
in
this
French
province
Reb
Israel
Lazarovitch
you
no-good
Romanian
you're
right
Who
cares
whether
or
not
the
Messiah
is
a
Litvak
Let
them
step
with
us
or
not
in
their
logical
shrouds
We've
raised
a
bright
white
flag
In
this
poem
we
see
their
shared
Jewishness
and
the
irreverence
as
some
would
see
it
they
each
had
for
the
Tradition
at
least
for
that
view
of
it
which
some
espoused
we
also
see
a
shared
disdain
for
rabbinic
and
priestly
logic
to
them
both
a
form
of
mental
death
As
Leonard
commented
in
Police
Gazette
I'd
rather
sleep
with
ashes
than
with
priestly
wisdom
which
has
even
more
point
when
we
understand
that
the
ashes
referred
to
are
those
of
the
victims
of
the
Holocaust
Professor
Pacey
referred
to
Layton
as
a
poet
of
revolutionary
individualism
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
that
individualism
was
a
common
tie
and
not
merely
religiously
but
in
every
way
Not
least
in
the
sexual
for
both
projected
a
red-blooded
response
to
their
manhood
which
goes
beyond
the
merely
sexual
or
corporeal
claiming
demanding
the
full
world
of
nature
and
manhood
as
their
proper
spheres
nothing
was
to
be
too
sacred
for
all
is
sacred
a
Blakeian
conception
which
predates
Blake
in
its
patent
Jewishness
by
millennia
not
centuries
Said
Leonard
to
us
over
a
bottle
of
Sabbath
wine
I
did
not
have
a
scholar's
bent
at
that
time
I
spent
many
evenings
with
Layton
and
we
would
crack
poetry
together
discover
the
poet's
meaning
That
is
training
at
its
best
serious
dedicated
Ours
was
an
ad
hoc
group
We
lived
for
it
in
between
homes
and
restaurants
Significantly
he
adduced
the
work
of
the
American
poet
Wallace
Stevens
at
this
point
a
man
torn
between
the
profession
of
law
and
the
poetic
muse
whose
view
of
lost
faith
and
a
disconnected
tradition
imbued
his
poetry
with
a
wistfulness
and
a
challenge
that
was
taken
very
seriously
by
Leonard
and
Layton
or
perhaps
viewed
by
them
as
a
satisfactory
replacement
As
Layton
asked
in
his
poem
To
The
Roaring
Wind
or
was
it
to
the
Spirit-behind-the
wind
What
syllable
are
you
seeking
Vocalissimus
In
the
distances
of
sleep
Speak
it
This
was
the
year
in
which
Leonard
was
elected
president
of
McGill's
Debating
Society
He
was
as
we
have
seen
already
President
of
his
fraternity
The
following
is
his
acceptance
speech
as
President
and
while
betraying
a
certain
youthfulness
it
demonstrates
the
cast
the
humour
and
the
audacity
of
his
mind
at
that
time
Mr
Chairman
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
The
foreigners
in
Ottawa
constitute
an
ominous
threat
to
the
integrity
and
autonomy
of
our
province
The
Communists
in
the
CBC
have
tried
to
poison
our
minds
with
bolshevism
and
the
capitalists
of
Ontario
have
tried
to
poison
our
bodies
with
margarine
Twice
in
the
last
half
century
they
have
plunged
us
into
British
wars
and
twice
have
they
taken
our
finest
youth
from
under
our
beds
and
from
behind
our
hams
We
are
incompatible
with
them
because
they
cannot
understand
us
or
comprehend
our
heritage
In
our
Church
they
see
bigotry
in
our
homespun
cloth
they
see
provincialism
in
our
wooden
ploughs
they
see
something
primitive
in
our
fallen
bridges
they
see
corruption
And
ladies
and
gentlemen
how
long
before
they
interfere
with
the
very
guardians
of
our
existence
and
prevent
the
provincial
police
from
shooting
down
vicious
unarmed
textile
strikers
These
are
the
things
we
believe
in
the
things
they
are
trying
to
take
away
There
is
open
to
us
only
one
course
of
action
we
must
quit
the
Confederation
consolidate
and
centralise
our
own
power
But
who
is
qualified
to
lead
us
on
this
Crusade
The
answer
is
as
obvious
as
the
sign
on
a
streetcar
it
is
a
business
man
In
this
day
governments
handle
astronomical
sums
and
a
multitude
of
people
In
effect
a
government
today
is
big
business
Who
then
more
logical
to
head
our
new
government
but
a
business
man
There
is
nothing
so
admirable
as
a
man
who
applies
his
knowledge
with
forceful
direction
and
from
his
efficiency
reaps
a
profit
To
be
a
good
business
man
is
the
epitome
of
development
and
these
learned
people
secretly
aspire
to
that
goal
For
what
are
their
professions
and
avocations
per
se
without
the
business
sense
The
lawyer
is
a
deceptive
sophist
half
smothered
in
ipso
factos
The
artsman
is
an
antique
fossil
and
at
best
will
make
a
fine
filing
clerk
And
would
we
trust
the
doctor
to
rule
I
am
reminded
of
a
short
verse
written
in
Roman
times
when
even
then
they
knew
the
nature
of
doctors
It
goes
But
when
the
wit
began
to
wheeze
And
wine
had
warmed
the
politician
Cured
yesterday
of
my
disease
I
died
last
night
of
my
physician
And
the
engineer
or
scientist
an
automaton
his
imagination
chained
to
a
drawing
board
by
a
formula
and
a
slide
rule
Will
he
be
our
new
leader
Quebec
was
the
last
province
to
give
the
vote
to
women
Under
the
new
r
gime
we
would
be
the
first
province
to
disenfranchise
them
For
as
Ambrose
Pierce
said
Here's
to
woman
Would
that
we
could
fall
into
her
arms
without
falling
into
her
hands
And
frankly
ladies
and
gentlemen
what
is
a
theological
student
but
a
sebastomaniac
But
don't
despair
my
friends
Even
for
the
engineer
there
is
still
hope
Charles
E
Wilson
the
newly
appointed
Secretary
of
Defence
graduated
as
an
engineer
but
soon
realised
there
were
better
things
in
life
and
he
took
a
course
in
commerce
and
went
into
business
and
is
now
engaged
in
the
most
complicated
of
businesses
that
of
running
a
country
But
perhaps
I
should
not
encourage
you
The
business
man
can
use
you
all
in
the
new
r
gime
But
you
must
all
acknowledge
his
obvious
superiority
To
close
I
should
like
to
quote
from
a
source
that
especially
some
of
us
find
more
authoritative
than
a
business
man
It
is
the
Holy
Bible
and
if
you
will
turn
to
Proverbs
the
following
quotation
will
be
found
Seest
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
business
He
shall
stand
before
kings
A
keen
and
powerful
debater
he
was
not
amused
at
the
dreariness
of
the
Executive's
meetings
the
small
talk
and
the
administration
never
his
strong
point
So
he
refused
to
call
the
Executive
at
all!
It
led
to
a
major
fracas
in
which
some
tried
to
get
him
unelected
but
failed
The
rebel
was
sharpening
his
teeth!
Such
behaviour
did
not
recommend
itself
to
another
more
discreet
influence
on
Leonard
during
those
undergraduate
years
Professor
F.R
Scott
later
Dean
of
the
Faculty
of
Law
presently
while
Leonard
swithered
and
swayed
as
to
whether
he
should
commit
himself
to
the
arts
or
commerce
his
lecturer
in
law
An
influence
on
Leonard
equal
to
that
of
A
M
Klein
also
a
lawyer
but
more
importantly
a
poet-novelist
of
considerable
skill
whose
familiarity
with
literature
equalled
his
Jewish
erudition
and
commitment
unlike
Leonard
he
was
a
ghetto
Jew
of
Montreal
Leonard
dedicated
a
poem
to
him
Song
For
Abrabam
Klein
in
which
poetry
and
song
find
their
first
and
significant
expression
Steinberg
introducing
Klein's
brilliant
novel
The
Second
Scroll
draws
attention
to
The
obsessive
theme
of
the
discovered
poetry
of
New
Israel
is
the
miraculous
and
the
key
image
necessary
to
explain
the
remarkable
vitality
the
rebirth
evidenced
in
every
aspect
of
life
is
the
miracle
A
theme
and
an
image
which
will
be
apparent
and
crucial
for
Leonard's
own
novel
Beautiful
Losers
It
is
doubtful
if
Leonard
learned
much
law
from
Scott
Even
when
in
lectures
which
was
not
often
his
mind
was
elsewhere
But
there
was
a
degree
of
comprehension
if
not
agreement
from
the
professor
Scott
was
in
fact
a
poet
of
considerable
skill
himself
a
founding
father
no
less
of
Canada's
emerging
poetry
movement
and
the
doyen
of
poetry
in
Montreal
which
has
produced
so
many
excellent
poets
An
odd
diversion
perhaps
from
one
of
the
country's
leading
constitutional
lawyers
but
he
was
seized
of
the
gift
and
so
the
poetry
became
assertive
His
presence
had
a
telling
if
quieter
effect
on
Leonard
than
that
of
Dudek
or
Layton
but
it
was
nevertheless
very
important
Scott
made
no
secret
of
Leonard's
ambiguities
regarding
law
and
he
sought
to
ease
him
into
a
position
nearer
to
his
own
of
both
lawyer
and
poet
But
Leonard
is
not
of
that
cloth
his
nature
is
obsessive
what
he
does
he
must
do
with
abandon
he
has
to
work
in
total
conviction
and
dedication
As
he
said
himself
of
this
time
I
yearned
to
live
a
semi-bohemian
lifestyle
an
unstructured
life
but
a
consecrated
one
some
kind
of
calling
It
was
this
that
fostered
an
even
more
radical
bid
for
his
independence
Being
adequately
provided
for
he
was
able
to
book
himself
into
a
downtown
hotel
which
cost
him
three
dollars
per
night
though
he
often
failed
to
make
it
back
to
the
hotel
finding
the
cosmopolitan
and
nocturnal
life
of
the
town
there
entirely
to
his
liking
consecration
dismantled!

CHAPTER
FIVE
Life
in
the
front
line
FOR
WILLIAMS
THE
Grand
Prix
season
started
on
an
unusual
note
with
two
new
drivers
going
into
the
first
race
Generally
speaking
Grand
Prix
teams
don't
like
to
change
both
their
key
employees
at
the
same
time
An
element
of
continuity
not
only
from
the
standpoint
of
technical
development
but
also
personal
chemistry
is
regarded
as
beneficial
However
Hill's
presence
alongside
Prost
represented
that
crucial
thread
of
continuity
He
hadn't
raced
for
the
team
before
but
his
testing
experience
meant
that
he
knew
the
ropes
Damon
was
well
acquainted
with
the
Williams
environment
and
familiar
with
the
personnel
Unquestionably
Hill
was
popular
amongst
the
mechanics
and
engineers
who
found
his
unobtrusive
low-key
approach
something
of
a
refreshing
counterpoint
to
Mansell's
character
which
although
dynamically
competitive
could
also
be
nerve
jangling
in
its
volatility
Hill
was
also
well-acquainted
with
the
revised
specification
of
the
Williams-Renault
FW15C
which
the
team
would
use
in
its
latest
assault
on
the
championship
The
previous
summer
the
sport's
governing
body
had
decided
for
an
avalanche
of
reasons
which
need
not
bother
us
here
that
tyre
sizes
were
to
be
reduced
for
This
meant
quite
a
major
revamp
to
the
specification
of
the
Williams-Renault
package
and
Damon
was
in
at
the
ground
floor
when
these
changes
were
announced
testing
the
revised
car
long
before
he
was
confirmed
as
a
full-time
team
member
For
those
fans
anxious
to
hail
Damon
as
Nigel
Mansell's
logical
successor
the
opening
weeks
of
were
as
manna
from
the
heavens
In
a
succession
of
crucial
preseason
tests
Damon
emerged
as
quick
as
if
not
quicker
than
Alain
Prost
It
was
all
heartening
stuff
Perhaps
after
all
the
English
novice
was
going
to
give
his
new
French
colleague
a
good
going-over
Perhaps
Prost
had
lost
his
touch
during
his
sabbatical
year
in
Then
perhaps
not
Either
way
there
was
an
intoxicating
element
of
unpredictability
surrounding
the
run-up
to
the
first
race
of
the
season
the
South
African
Grand
Prix
scheduled
to
take
place
at
Johannesburg's
Kyalami
circuit
on
March
still
coming
to
grips
with
the
challenges
involved
in
competing
in
such
exalted
company
For
Damon
this
was
a
baptism
of
fire
No
longer
was
he
driving
the
old
Brabham-Judd
keeping
one
eye
firmly
trained
on
his
mirror
to
avoid
holding
up
the
faster
cars
Now
he
was
one
of
the
pacesetters
one
of
the
Top
Dogs
for
whom
the
smaller
fry
had
to
watch
out
Yet
despite
being
armed
with
one
of
the
best
cars
on
the
circuit
he
was
still
coming
to
grips
with
the
challenge
involved
in
competing
in
such
exalted
company
At
the
end
of
qualifying
he
was
fourth
Pole
position
had
submitted
to
the
silken
precision
of
Alain
Prost
with
a
lap
in
min
secs
Ayrton
Senna
in
the
highly
promising
new
McLaren-Ford
MP4/8
was
second
on
min
secs
while
Michael
Schumacher's
similarly
powered
Benetton
crouched
alongside
and
slightly
ahead
of
Hill's
Williams
on
the
inside
of
the
second
row
three-tenths
of
a
second
faster
than
the
Londoner
Damon
had
experienced
a
few
troubles
on
the
first
day
of
qualifying
A
warning
light
in
the
cockpit
kept
coming
on
intermittently
he
explained
and
that
forced
me
to
stop
in
the
pits
quite
a
few
times
But
I
managed
to
get
a
few
laps
behind
Senna
which
was
very
worth-
while
because
it
taught
me
a
few
good
lines
through
some
of
the
corners
One
of
the
new
rules
imposed
for
the
Kyalami
race
included
shortening
the
practice
sessions
and
limiting
the
number
of
tyres
available
to
each
competing
car
to
seven
sets
per
race
weekend
Inevitably
that
imposed
additional
pressure
on
F1's
latest
crop
of
newcomers
but
Damon
for
his
part
came
through
the
test
in
characteristically
assured
fashion
Nevertheless
he
was
disappointed
that
he
did
not
improve
his
time
on
the
second
day
His
lack
of
front-line
experience
caused
him
to
get
tangled
up
amongst
a
knot
of
slower
cars
during
that
crucial
second
qualifying
session
By
the
time
he'd
found
himself
a
piece
of
clear
track
his
last
set
of
practice
tyres
were
five
laps
old
and
losing
the
fine
edge
of
their
grip
usually
at
its
optimum
two
or
three
laps
into
a
qualifying
run
He
rounded
off
the
session
by
spinning
after
moving
off
the
racing
line
as
he
attempted
to
overtake
one
of
the
unwieldy
new
Lola-Ferraris
Despite
this
fourth
place
on
the
grid
on
his
debut
for
Williams
was
an
excellent
effort
by
Hill
His
time
had
only
been
bettered
by
the
two
established
superstars
of
the
previous
decade
and
the
man
regarded
as
the
most
promising
new
blood
Damon's
task
was
now
to
insert
his
previously
unremarkable
reputation
into
that
latter
category
When
it
came
to
the
race
Damon
blotted
his
copybook
within
seconds
of
the
green
starting
light
Senna
made
a
perfect
start
while
Prost
got
bogged
down
slightly
and
Hill
found
himself
in
second
place
as
the
pack
slammed
into
the
first
fast
bend
The
occasion
proved
all
a
bit
much
for
the
Englishman
Here
he
was
in
his
third
Grand
Prix
with
only
the
legendary
Senna
and
his
McLaren
between
him
and
the
lead
Anxious
to
cover
himself
in
glory
he
allowed
his
Williams
to
get
too
close
to
the
rear
wing
of
the
McLaren
as
they
exited
the
second
part
of
the
corner
One
of
the
deterrents
to
close
racing
in
Formula
is
the
aerodynamic
turbulence
caused
by
a
speeding
Grand
Prix
car
Its
profile
punches
a
pretty
considerable
hole
in
the
air
and
the
airflow
coming
off
its
rear
wing
at
speed
makes
life
quite
lively
for
anybody
following
closely
behind
In
simple
terms
if
an
F1
driver
gets
too
close
to
the
car
in
front
he'll
find
that
there
is
not
enough
air
flowing
over
the
nose
wings
of
his
own
machine
That
crucial
airflow
produces
the
downforce
which
helps
stick
the
front
end
of
the
car
firmly
to
the
track
Remove
it
and
the
front
end
goes
light
Suddenly
and
frighteningly
The
outcome
of
all
this
was
that
Damon
lost
control
of
his
Williams
and
spun
wildly
in
front
of
the
other
competing
cars
Prost
locked
up
and
dodged
through
on
the
left
but
the
Frenchman's
success
in
avoiding
smart
contact
with
his
teammate
was
as
much
to
do
with
the
lucky
fact
that
Damon
spun
away
from
the
racing
line
as
to
any
great
judgement
on
his
part
As
Prost
chased
off
after
Senna
eventually
to
cement
his
new
Williams
relationship
by
defeating
the
Brazilian
to
score
a
win
on
his
maiden
outing
Hill
settled
down
to
compose
himself
in
th
place
Before
he
had
a
chance
to
get
his
second
wind
Damon
found
himself
bundled
off
the
circuit
after
Lotus
new
boy
Alessandro
Zanardi
attempted
an
overambitious
passing
manoeuvre
which
didn't
come
off
Later
Damon
reflected
on
his
race
I
made
a
great
start
but
I
was
right
up
to
Ayrton's
wing
and
it
was
really
too
much
It
caught
me
out
a
little
The
spin
was
a
mistake
my
fault
I
put
it
down
to
experience
I
managed
to
recover
and
keep
going
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
overtake
out
there
If
I
had
not
spun
on
that
lap
I
would
not
have
been
where
I
was
down
the
field
and
would
not
have
got
into
any
other
trouble
I
felt
Zanardi
was
taking
a
big
risk
by
lunging
there
at
the
same
point
on
each
lap
But
I
have
to
take
the
responsibility
I
could
not
avoid
him
because
Alliot
the
French
driver
Philippe
Alliot
driving
a
Larrousse-Lamborghini
was
in
my
way
A
fortnight
later
the
second
round
of
the
championship
took
place
in
an
environment
so
far
removed
from
Kyalami
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
it
was
on
the
same
planet
The
Formula
fraternity
swapped
the
parched
rolling
Sackcloth
of
the
Veldt
for
the
grimy
urban
squalor
of
Brazil's
industrial
second
city
Sao
Paulo
If
anybody
needs
convincing
that
Brazil
is
not
all
surf
sand
and
willowy
blondes
then
Sao
Paulo
must
have
been
put
on
earth
to
achieve
that
very
purpose
Yet
the
Autodromo
Carlos
Pace
at
Interlagos
so
named
after
the
popular
Brazilian
who
won
his
home
Grand
Prix
here
in
only
to
be
killed
in
a
light
aircraft
accident
two
years
later
used
to
be
one
of
the
epic
tracks
on
the
international
trail
Originally
Interlagos
was
a
daunting
five-mile
blind
incorporating
some
of
the
most
challenging
high
speed
corners
to
be
found
on
a
circuit
in
the
world
However
between
and
the
Brazilian
Grand
Prix
was
staged
at
Rio
de
Janeiro's
bland
Autodromo
Riocentro
and
by
the
time
it
was
switched
back
to
Sao
Paulo
in
Interlagos
had
been
emasculated
by
a
redesign
to
conform
to
the
latest
safety
standards
Yet
the
passionate
enthusiasm
of
the
sophisticated
Sao
Paulo
crowd
weaned
on
home-brewed
heroes
such
as
Senna
and
the
Fittipaldi
clan
not
to
mention
foreigners
like
the
Rio-born
Nelson
Piquet
makes
for
quite
an
occasion
and
there
are
sections
of
the
circuit
which
still
retain
their
original
appeal
Damon
had
to
be
dissuaded
from
launching
a
final
challenge
to
Prost's
pole
position
In
the
fortnight
separating
the
first
two
races
of
the
sport
governing
body
FISA
made
some
minor
adjustments
to
the
F1
regulations
After
experimenting
with
reduced
length
practice
sessions
at
Kyalami
the
programme
now
reverted
to
its
format
with
minutes
allocated
for
free
practice
on
Friday
and
Saturday
morning
and
an
hour
of
official
timed
qualifying
on
both
those
afternoons
Now
the
limitation
on
running
time
was
confined
to
a
total
of
laps
per
car
during
each
morning
session
and
in
the
afternoon
Anybody
doing
more
than
laps
in
the
morning
would
have
the
excess
docked
from
their
allowance
in
the
afternoon
and
anybody
completing
more
than
an
accumulated
total
of
laps
over
the
two
sessions
would
have
any
such
surplus
disallowed
Quite
naturally
Senna
was
hell-bent
on
winning
this
race
in
his
own
personal
backyard
but
the
estimated
bhp
surplus
enjoyed
by
the
two
Williams-Renault
drivers
ensured
he
was
kept
back
in
third
place
by
the
time
the
final
grid
order
was
published
Damon
felt
he
did
a
much
better
job
than
he
had
managed
at
Kyalami
although
it's
difficult
to
explore
the
limits
of
the
car
on
a
track
like
this
where
I
have
no
previous
experience
Prost's
familiarity
with
Interlagos
was
emphasised
by
the
fact
that
he
lapped
a
full
second
faster
than
Hill
to
earn
pole
position
but
Damon
was
content
with
the
inner
belief
that
he
could
have
gone
quicker
Anyway
he
had
a
comfortable
cushion
of
sec
over
Senna's
third-placed
McLaren
In
fact
Damon
had
to
be
dissuaded
from
launching
a
final
challenge
to
Prost's
pole
position
It
looks
good
out
there
he
said
optimistically
to
Frank
Williams
over
his
radio
link
as
he
sat
strapped
in
the
cockpit
suffused
with
enthusiasm
as
the
last
few
moments
of
the
second
qualifying
session
ticked
away
No
Damon
said
Williams
with
a
slight
sense
of
amusement
There
was
a
pause
It
looks
really
good
out
there
Frank!
repeated
Damon
No
Damon
replied
his
boss
I
don't
want
you
having
the
added
pressure
of
having
to
start
from
pole
position
And
there
the
matter
was
left
to
rest
Scattered
showers
were
forecast
for
the
race
day
at
Interlagos
but
Prost
signalled
that
he
was
unlikely
to
be
troubled
by
a
wet
track
when
he
set
a
best
time
sec
faster
than
Hill
in
the
half-hour
rack
morning
warmup
session
which
so
often
provides
a
telling
pointer
to
impending
race
form
Sure
enough
Prost
accelerated
neatly
away
into
the
lead
at
the
start
with
Senna
cutting
through
to
take
an
immediate
second
place
ahead
of
Hill
By

lap
Alain
was

himself

Hill

noted
that

in

as

for

My
Cries
for
Help
The
sound
of
voices
raised
in
anger
and
hysterical
sobbing
could
be
plainly
heard
coming
from
the
suite
of
rooms
occupied
by
the
Prince
and
Princess
of
Wales
at
Sandringham
House
It
was
shortly
after
Christmas
but
there
was
little
festive
feeling
between
the
royal
couple
Diana
was
then
three
months
pregnant
with
Prince
William
and
felt
absolutely
wretched
Her
relationship
with
Prince
Charles
was
rapidly
unravelling
The
Prince
seemed
incapable
of
understanding
or
wishing
to
comprehend
the
turmoil
in
Diana's
life
She
was
suffering
dreadfully
from
morning
sickness
she
was
haunted
by
Camilla
Parker-Bowles
and
she
was
desperately
trying
to
accommodate
herself
to
her
new
position
and
new
family
As
she
later
told
friends
One
minute
I
was
a
nobody
the
next
minute
I
was
Princess
of
Wales
mother
media
toy
member
of
this
family
and
it
was
just
too
much
for
one
person
to
handle
She
had
pleaded
cajoled
and
quarrelled
violently
as
she
tried
to
win
the
Prince's
assistance
In
vain
On
that
January
day
in
her
first
New
Year
within
the
royal
family
she
now
threatened
to
take
her
own
life
He
accused
her
of
crying
wolf
and
prepared
to
go
riding
on
the
Sandringham
estate
She
was
as
good
as
her
word
Standing
on
top
of
the
wooden
staircase
she
hurled
herself
to
the
ground
landing
in
a
heap
at
the
bottom
The
Queen
Mother
was
one
of
the
first
to
arrive
on
the
scene
She
was
horrified
physically
shaking
with
the
shock
of
what
she
had
witnessed
A
local
doctor
was
summoned
while
George
Pinker
Diana's
gynaecologist
travelled
from
London
to
visit
his
royal
patient
Her
husband
simply
dismissed
her
plight
and
carried
on
with
his
plan
to
go
riding
Fortunately
Diana
was
not
seriously
hurt
by
the
fall
although
she
did
suffer
severe
bruising
around
her
stomach
A
full
check-up
revealed
that
the
foetus
had
not
been
injured
The
incident
was
one
of
many
domestic
crises
which
crowded
in
upon
the
royal
couple
in
those
tumultuous
early
days
At
every
turning
point
they
put
a
greater
distance
between
each
other
As
her
friend
James
Gilbey
observes
of
her
suicide
attempts
They
were
messages
of
complete
desperation
Please
please
help
In
the
first
years
of
their
married
life
Diana
made
several
suicide
bids
and
numerous
threats
It
should
be
emphasized
that
they
were
not
serious
attempts
to
take
her
life
but
cries
for
help
On
one
occasion
she
threw
herself
against
a
glass
display
cabinet
at
Kensington
Palace
while
on
another
she
slashed
at
her
wrists
with
a
razor
blade
Another
time
she
cut
herself
with
the
serrated
edge
of
a
lemon
slicer
on
yet
another
occasion
during
a
heated
argument
with
Prince
Charles
she
picked
up
a
penknife
lying
on
his
dressing
table
and
cut
her
chest
and
her
thighs
Although
she
was
bleeding
her
husband
studiously
scorned
her
As
ever
he
thought
that
she
was
faking
her
problems
Later
on
her
sister
Jane
who
saw
her
shortly
afterwards
remarked
on
the
score
marks
on
her
body
Jane
was
horrified
when
she
learned
the
truth
As
Diana
has
since
told
friends
They
were
desperate
cries
for
help
I
just
needed
time
to
adjust
to
my
new
position
One
friend
who
watched
their
relationship
deteriorate
points
to
Prince
Charles's
disinterest
and
total
lack
of
respect
for
her
at
a
time
when
Diana
badly
needed
help
His
indifference
pushed
her
to
the
edge
whereas
he
could
have
romanced
her
to
the
end
of
the
world
They
could
have
set
the
world
alight
Through
no
fault
of
his
own
because
of
his
own
ignorance
upbringing
and
lack
of
a
whole
relationship
with
anyone
in
his
life
he
instilled
this
hatred
of
herself
This
is
a
partisan
appraisal
In
the
early
days
of
their
marriage
Prince
Charles
did
for
a
time
try
to
ease
his
wife
into
the
royal
routine
Her
first
big
test
was
a
three-day
visit
to
Wales
in
October
The
crowds
made
it
painfully
obvious
who
was
the
new
star
of
the
show
the
Princess
of
Wales
Charles
was
left
apologizing
for
not
having
enough
wives
to
go
round
If
he
took
one
side
of
the
street
during
a
walkabout
the
crowd
collectively
groaned
it
was
his
wife
they
had
come
to
see
I
seem
to
do
nothing
but
collect
flowers
these
days
he
said
I
know
my
role
Behind
the
smiles
there
were
other
muttered
concerns
The
first
sight
of
the
Princess
on
a
rainswept
quayside
in
Wales
came
as
a
shock
to
royal
watchers
It
was
the
first
chance
to
see
Diana
close
up
since
the
long
honeymoon
and
it
was
like
looking
at
a
different
woman
She
wasn't
just
slim
she
was
painfully
thin
She
had
lost
weight
before
the
wedding
that
was
only
to
be
expected
but
the
girl
moving
through
the
crowds
shaking
hands
and
accepting
flowers
looked
positively
transparent
Diana
was
two
months
pregnant
and
feeling
worse
than
she
looked
She
chose
the
wrong
clothes
for
the
torrential
rain
which
followed
their
every
move
she
was
wracked
by
severe
morning
sickness
and
absolutely
overwhelmed
by
the
crowds
who
turned
out
to
see
her
Diana
admits
that
she
wasn't
easy
to
handle
during
that
baptism
of
fire
She
was
often
in
tears
as
they
travelled
to
the
various
venues
telling
her
husband
that
she
simply
could
not
face
the
crowds
She
didn't
have
the
energy
or
the
resources
to
cope
with
the
prospect
of
meeting
so
many
people
There
were
times
many
times
when
she
longed
to
be
back
in
her
safe
bachelor
apartment
with
her
jolly
uncomplicated
friends
While
Prince
Charles
sympathized
with
his
tearful
wife
he
insisted
that
the
royal
roadshow
had
to
go
on
He
was
understandably
apprehensive
when
Diana
made
her
first
speech
partly
in
Welsh
at
Cardiff
City
Hall
when
she
was
presented
with
the
Freedom
of
the
City
While
Diana
passed
that
test
with
aplomb
she
discovered
another
truism
about
royal
life
However
well
she
did
however
hard
she
tried
she
never
earned
a
word
of
praise
from
her
husband
the
royal
family
or
their
courtiers
In
her
vulnerable
lonely
position
a
little
applause
would
have
worked
wonders
I
remember
her
saying
that
she
was
trying
so
damn
hard
and
all
she
needed
was
a
pat
on
the
back
recalls
a
friend
But
it
wasn't
forthcoming
Every
day
she
fought
back
the
waves
of
nausea
in
order
to
fulfil
her
public
engagements
She
had
such
a
morbid
fear
of
letting
down
her
husband
and
the
royal
family
firm
that
she
performed
her
official
duties
when
she
was
quite
clearly
unwell
On
two
occasions
she
had
to
cancel
engagements
on
others
she
looked
pale
and
sickly
acutely
aware
that
she
was
not
helping
her
husband
At
least
after
her
pregnancy
was
officially
announced
on
November
Diana
could
publicly
discuss
her
condition
The
weary
Princess
said
Some
days
I
feel
terrible
No-one
told
me
I
would
feel
like
I
did
She
confessed
to
a
passion
for
bacon
and
tomato
sandwiches
and
took
to
telephoning
her
friend
Sarah
Ferguson
the
daughter
of
Charles's
polo
manager
Major
Ronald
Ferguson
The
irrepressible
redhead
regularly
left
her
job
at
a
London
art
dealer
and
drove
round
to
Buckingham
Palace
to
cheer
up
the
royal
mother-to-be
In
private
it
was
no
better
She
stalwartly
refused
to
take
any
drugs
once
again
arguing
that
she
could
not
hold
herself
responsible
if
the
baby
were
born
deformed
At
the
same
time
she
acknowledged
that
she
was
now
seen
by
the
rest
of
the
royal
family
as
a
problem
At
formal
dinners
at
Sandringham
or
Windsor
Castle
she
frequently
had
to
leave
the
table
to
be
ill
Instead
of
simply
going
to
bed
she
insisted
on
returning
believing
that
it
was
her
duty
to
try
and
fulfil
her
obligations
If
daily
life
was
difficult
public
duties
were
a
nightmare
The
visit
to
Wales
had
been
a
triumph
but
Diana
had
felt
overwhelmed
by
her
popularity
the
size
of
the
crowds
and
the
proximity
of
the
media
She
was
riding
a
tiger
and
there
was
no
way
of
escape
For
the
first
few
months
she
trembled
at
the
thought
of
performing
an
official
engagement
on
her
own
Where
possible
she
would
join
Charles
and
remain
by
his
side
silent
attentive
but
still
terrified
When
she
accepted
her
first
solo
public
duty
to
switch
on
the
Christmas
lights
at
Regent
Street
in
London's
West
End
she
was
paralyzed
with
nerves
She
felt
sick
as
she
made
a
brief
speech
which
was
delivered
in
a
rapid
monotone
At
the
end
of
that
engagement
she
was
glad
to
return
home
to
Buckingham
Palace
It
didn't
get
any
easier
The
girl
who
would
only
appear
in
school
plays
if
she
had
a
non-speaking
part
was
now
centre
stage
It
took
by
her
own
admission
six
years
before
she
felt
comfortable
appearing
in
her
starring
role
Fortunately
for
her
the
camera
had
already
fallen
in
love
with
the
new
royal
cover
girl
However
nervous
she
may
have
felt
inside
her
warm
smile
and
unaffected
manner
were
a
photographer's
delight
For
once
the
camera
did
lie
not
about
the
beauty
she
was
becoming
but
in
camouflaging
the
vulnerable
personality
behind
her
effortless
capacity
to
dazzle
She
believes
that
she
was
able
to
smile
through
the
pain
thanks
to
qualities
she
inherited
from
her
mother
When
friends
ask
how
she
was
able
to
display
such
a
sunny
public
countenance
she
says
I've
got
what
my
mother
has
got
However
bloody
you
are
feeling
you
can
put
on
the
most
amazing
show
of
happiness
My
mother
is
an
expert
at
that
and
I've
picked
it
up
It
kept
the
wolves
from
the
door
The
ability
to
become
this
smiling
persona
in
public
is
helped
by
the
nature
of
bulimia
which
is
a
disease
where
sufferers
can
maintain
their
normal
body
weight
unlike
its
sister
illness
anorexia
nervosa
where
you
slim
to
skin
and
bone
At
the
same
time
Diana's
healthy
lifestyle
of
regular
exercise
little
alcohol
and
early
nights
gave
her
the
energy
to
carry
on
with
her
royal
duties
As
an
eating-disorders
expert
explained
Bulimics
do
not
admit
they
have
a
problem
There
are
always
smiles
no
problems
in
their
lives
and
they
spend
their
time
trying
to
please
others
But
there
is
unhappiness
underneath
because
they
are
frightened
to
express
their
anger
At
the
same
time
her
deep
sense
of
duty
and
obligation
impelled
her
to
keep
up
appearances
for
the
sake
of
the
public
A
close
friend
says
The
public
side
of
her
was
very
different
from
the
private
side
They
wanted
a
fairy
princess
to
come
and
touch
them
and
turn
everything
into
gold
All
their
worries
would
be
forgotten
Little
did
they
realize
that
the
individual
was
crucifying
herself
inside
Diana
an
unwilling
international
media
celebrity
was
having
to
learn
on
the
hoof
There
was
no
training
backup
or
advice
from
within
the
royal
system
Everything
was
piecemeal
and
haphazard
Charles's
courtiers
were
used
to
dealing
with
a
bachelor
of
fixed
habits
and
a
set
routine
Marriage
changed
all
that
During
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
there
was
consternation
that
Prince
Charles
would
not
be
able
to
afford
his
portion
of
the
expense
Sums
were
worked
out
on
the
backs
of
envelopes
it
was
chaos
recalls
one
former
member
of
his
Household
The
momentum
which
continued
long
after
the
wedding
took
everyone
by
surprise
Even
though
extra
staff
were
drafted
in
Diana
herself
sat
down
to
answer
many
of
the
letters
of
congratulation
and
gifts
which
the
wedding
generated
She
frequently
had
to
pinch
herself
with
the
absurdity
of
it
all
One
moment
she
was
cleaning
floors
for
a
living
the
next
receiving
a
pair
of
brass
candlesticks
from
the
King
and
Queen
of
Sweden
or
making
small
talk
with
the
President
of
Somewhere
or
Other
Fortunately
her
upbringing
had
given
her
the
social
training
to
cope
with
these
situations
This
was
just
as
well
because
the
federal
structure
of
the
royal
family
means
that
everyone
keeps
to
their
own
province

Coronation
Street
a
New
Life
It
was
and
Julie
had
landed
the
part
of
Bet
Lynch
in
Coronation
Street
Her
stomach
was
churning
as
she
stood
nervously
at
the
bus
stop
in
Heywood
on
her
first
morning
Jingling
the
change
in
her
pocket
she
calculated
she
had
just
enough
cash
to
get
to
the
Manchester
studios
and
back
Then
a
friend
of
her
stepfather's
pulled
up
driving
a
concrete
mixer
a
huge
barrel
rolling
slowly
round
on
the
back
He
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
shouted
Would
you
like
a
lift
Julie
Yes
please
she
said
hauling
herself
into
the
cab
As
Julie
and
her
driver
pulled
up
outside
Granada
Television's
headquarters
Pat
Phoenix
was
arriving
in
her
expensive
vintage
Rolls-Royce
Both
vehicles
stood
bumper
to
bumper
outside
the
studios
and
Julie
jumped
out
none
too
lady-like
just
as
Pat
caught
her
eye
She
looked
me
up
and
down
with
an
expression
of
total
disbelief
and
I
wanted
the
ground
to
open
up
and
swallow
me
said
Julie
But
as
she
passed
the
doorman
she
heard
the
clink
of
coppers
in
her
coat
and
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
that
she
had
enough
money
to
buy
a
butty
at
lunchtime
Coronation
Street
needed
an
injection
of
glamour
They
had
been
looking
for
a
sexy
new
character
to
rival
Pat
Phoenix's
vamp
Elsie
Tanner
and
Julie
had
just
what
they
were
looking
for
When
June
Howson
took
over
as
producer
she
offered
Julie
a
three-month
contract
June
had
been
a
fan
of
Julie's
since
she
worked
with
her
on
Nearest
and
Dearest
and
A
Family
at
War
Lots
of
actresses
come
and
go
in
the
Street
but
long-term
survival
is
about
bringing
something
special
to
a
character
Street
scripts
are
pretty
flawless
even
an
average
actor
can
deliver
the
skilfully
drafted
lines
but
to
inject
individuality
into
a
part
needs
a
unique
ingredient
Julie
had
what
it
took
and
was
determined
to
succeed
Veteran
scriptwriter
Esther
Rose
remembers
how
Julie
cracked
open
the
chrysalis
that
was
Bet
At
first
Bet
Lynch
wasn't
much
of
a
part
she
said
But
Julie
really
made
the
most
of
it
Bet
was
cheeky
and
quick-witted
She
had
a
reputation
for
being
easy
always
fell
for
rogues
who
made
her
feel
cheap
and
misused
her
and
at
sixteen
had
already
had
an
illegitimate
baby
whom
she
was
forced
to
give
up
for
adoption
There
was
certainly
a
lot
of
heartbreak
behind
the
smile
It
was
a
juicy
part
for
an
actress
who
could
understand
what
made
Bet
tick
and
Esther
remembers
how
Julie
got
to
work
on
her
Bet's
uplifted
bosoms
earrings
and
tarty
clothes
were
Julie's
ideas
she
says
So
was
hanging
on
to
the
name
Bet
Lynch
When
Julie
returned
to
the
Street
producers
wanted
to
give
her
a
new
one
but
Julie
insisted
on
Bet
I
don't
know
why
It
was
just
right
for
her
she
says
now
Bet's
bolstered
B
boobs
and
infamous
cleavage
were
usually
encased
in
leopard-skin
lycra
revealing
skinny-rib
sweaters
or
blouses
with
plunging
necklines
Her
assets
were
mesmerising
and
technicians
nicknamed
them
Newton
Ridley
after
the
fictitious
Rovers
brewery
If
they
had
to
shoot
across
the
bar
and
thought
Julie's
chest
was
too
prominent
the
cameramen
would
shout
Dip
don't
dazzle
them
Newtons
Julie
just
laughs
and
says
Bet's
attitude
is
if
you've
got
it
flaunt
it
She
decided
brassy
Bet
would
wear
seamed
stockings
and
suspenders
Although
no
one
would
see
them
the
sexy
undies
made
her
feel
like
the
cheeky
barmaid
Bet's
peroxide
hair
all
tumbling
curls
or
back-combed
beehive
was
set
with
big
old-fashioned
rollers
Her
lipstick
and
nails
never
matched
She
always
clashed
Bet
epitomizes
back-street
glamour
It's
not
that
she
has
no
taste
it's
just
that
she
overdoes
the
glamour
said
Julie
Bet
had
to
look
as
though
she'd
nearly
got
it
right
If
the
nails
were
puce
the
lipstick
would
be
orange
and
if
the
eyeshadow
was
turquoise
the
earrings
had
to
be
green
Julie's
first
make-up
artist
Lois
Richardson
helped
create
the
famous
Bet
look
Lois
is
from
Rochdale
and
knows
the
Bets
of
this
world
inside
out
says
Julie
Her
plastic
earrings
became
a
trademark
and
over
the
years
Bet
has
collected
pairs
They
range
from
pink
feathers
to
tiny
toilets
and
when
she
wore
the
tiny
loos
the
seat
was
up
on
one
ear
while
on
the
other
it
was
down
When
the
Queen
and
Prince
Philip
visited
the
set
in
she
wore
earrings
bearing
pictures
of
Charles
and
Di
Now
Bet's
jewels
have
become
a
national
institution
Within
months
of
Bet
appearing
in
the
show
kids
were
spending
their
pocket
money
on
earrings
and
sending
them
in
so
I
had
to
wear
them
says
Julie
They'd
tell
their
friends
they'd
seen
me
on
television
and
their
friends
sent
more
in
and
it
snowballed
Now
they
come
from
all
over
the
world
It
was
not
Julie's
first
time
on
the
Street
Four
years
earlier
Julie
had
landed
the
role
of
cheeky
blonde
factory
worker
Bet
Lynch
By
chance
her
very
first
scene
was
in
the
Rovers
Return
ordering
a
pie
and
a
bottle
of
pale
ale
But
after
just
six
episodes
she
was
fired
Thanks
to
Pat
Phoenix
and
June
Howson
however
on
May
episode
number
Coronation
Street
s
Busty
Bet
Lynch
took
a
bow
Every
Monday
and
Wednesday
Coronation
Street
was
the
most
watched
programme
on
television
and
insiders
excitedly
reported
that
Julie
Goodyear
had
the
kind
of
natural
scene-stealing
personality
which
would
win
fans
and
boost
ratings
By
the
time
Julie
joined
the
cast
permanently
Coronation
Street
was
already
being
transmitted
worldwide
Even
the
natives
of
the
Polynesian
island
of
Oahu
where
the
top-rated
TV
series
Hawaii
Five-O
was
filmed
preferred
watching
regal
Rovers
Return
landlady
Annie
Walker
spar
with
husband
Jack
to
the
antics
of
TV
cop
Steve
McGarrett
and
his
sidekick
Danno
Viewers
in
Thailand
Sri
Lanka
Singapore
and
Sierra
Leone
were
hooked
on
tales
of
the
Rovers
Return
pub
in
Weatherfield
In
a
Canadian
television
station
bought
episodes
of
the
Street
a
transaction
which
made
the
Guinness
Book
of
Records
Julie
was
introduced
as
Bet
Lynch
the
happy-go-lucky
friend
of
recently
widowed
Irma
Barlow
scatter-brained
daughter
of
cleaning
lady
Hilda
Ogden
and
given
a
job
at
the
launderette
A
month
later
she
switched
to
the
Rovers
Return
For
Bet's
debut
behind
the
bar
Julie
wore
a
fluffy
white
skin-tight
knitted
two-piece
dress
held
together
with
flimsy
crocheted
cord
and
white
patent
sling-backs
Iron-fisted
Annie
Walker
ran
the
Rovers
with
the
dedication
of
a
drill
sergeant
She
thought
Bet
was
common
but
appreciated
that
her
blonde
hair
bosom
and
quickfire
banter
pulled
in
the
customers
In
the
early
days
Julie
sat
in
awe
of
the
Street
stars
like
Pat
Doris
Speed
who
played
Annie
Walker
and
Violet
Carson
who
played
the
formidable
Ena
Sharples
She
said
When
Pat
walked
into
the
green
room
you
bloody
knew
she'd
arrived
I
was
the
new
girl
on
the
block
I
kept
my
mouth
shut
when
Pat
or
Doris
opened
theirs
and
learned
my
craft
I
was
hungry
to
become
halfway
as
professional
as
they
were
so
I
spent
hours
just
watching
and
listening
When
I
wasn't
in
a
scene
I
was
somewhere
in
the
studio
lurking
behind
the
flats
I
called
them
Miss
Speed
Miss
Carson
and
Miss
Phoenix
It
was
a
mark
of
respect
It
took
six
months
for
Doris
Speed
to
approach
me
and
say
I'd
like
a
word
with
you
dear
She
told
me
that
from
that
day
on
I
was
allowed
to
call
her
Doris
rather
than
Miss
Speed
It
was
difficult
at
first
a
bit
like
calling
your
teacher
by
her
first
name
Julie
knew
instantly
she'd
made
the
right
move
She
said
When
I
joined
Coronation
Street
I
felt
I'd
come
home
Not
for
a
couple
of
years
but
to
stay
It
was
like
a
dress
that's
a
good
fit
and
just
right
for
you
It
was
a
mixture
of
the
part
the
people
the
place
everything
about
it
Friends
and
family
were
delighted
at
Julie's
break-
through
The
only
person
not
impressed
was
son
Gary
Julie
said
He
likes
Star
Trek
which
is
our
rival
programme
on
Wednesday
nights
Gary
said
if
I
could
have
got
a
part
on
Star
Trek
that
would
really
have
been
something
A
regular
part
in
Coronation
Street
meant
Julie
could
start
saving
She
loved
the
tiny
cobblestone
streets
the
mill
chimneys
and
corner
shops
in
Heyword
but
she
was
still
living
with
Gary
Alice
and
Bill
in
a
tiny
two-up
two-down
terraced
house
in
Gregge
Street
round
the
corner
from
the
Bay
Horse
Julie
planned
to
change
their
way
of
life
by
working
hard
and
saving
for
a
new
home
She
saved
spare
cash
in
a
savings
clock
she
kept
on
the
mantelpiece
in
the
living
room
She
knew
exactly
the
sort
of
place
she
wanted
to
buy
It's
going
to
be
detached
with
a
big
garden
for
Gary
to
play
in
and
the
windows
will
be
large
to
let
in
plenty
of
light
As
her
success
grew
Julie
had
no
desire
to
leave
Heywood
for
more
upmarket
areas
I
don't
want
anyone
to
get
the
idea
that
I'm
getting
stuck
up
because
I'm
on
the
telly
now
I
love
the
folk
round
here
that's
why
I'll
stay
here
in
Heywood
when
I
buy
the
house
Eventually
she
bought
a
modest
semi
on
Rochdale
Road
East
Bet
Lynch
was
an
overnight
success
Within
weeks
Julie's
mailbag
was
bulging
with
fan
letters
She
was
staggered
by
her
popularity
She
said
It
s
been
absolutely
fantastic
A
couple
of
the
other
actors
told
me
it
would
be
like
this
but
I
didn't
think
it
would
happen
to
me
After
the
first
few
episodes
I
used
to
walk
along
thinking
Come
along
somebody
recognise
me
Now
I
get
stopped
all
the
time
Letters
poured
in
A
lot
came
from
children
wanting
to
adopt
Bet
as
a
sister
or
asking
if
she
could
join
their
football
team
as
goalkeeper
She
also
had
the
usual
handful
from
obsessive
fans
Julie
said
There
is
one
man
who
keeps
trying
to
make
a
date
I
answer
each
of
his
letters
with
a
photograph
Bachelor
Desmond
Ingram
was
more
obsessive
than
others
The
only
time
love
flickered
for
lonely
factory
worker
Des
was
when
Bet
Lynch
appeared
on
his
television
screen
Twice
a
week
he
would
rush
home
from
the
Leicester
clock
factory
where
he
worked
have
a
shave
slap
on
the
aftershave
and
settle
in
front
of
the
telly
After
the
show
he
picked
up
a
pen
and
wrote
passionate
love
letters
to
Julie
or
picked
up
the
phone
in
a
bid
to
contact
her
Most
of
his
a-week
wages
was
spent
on
letters
and
phone
calls
to
the
woman
he
considered
a
goddess
He
said
It
wasn't
love
at
first
sight
but
each
week
as
I
watched
the
programme
I
found
myself
falling
more
in
love
with
her
Already
it's
costing
me
over
a
week
in
mail
and
phone
calls
which
only
leaves
me
enough
for
my
rent
and
food
but
it
is
worth
it
Julie
is
the
only
girl
in
the
world
for
me
Julie
found
such
attention
distressing
and
decided
to
call
a
halt
to
it
She
turned
down
an
invitation
to
dinner
and
told
Desmond
she
was
nothing
like
Bet
Lynch
It
wasn't
strictly
true
she
was
very
like
Bet
Lynch
but
he
believed
her
and
promised
to
leave
her
alone
Producers
were
delighted
with
her
popularity
and
Julie's
three-month
contract
was
renewed
That
Christmas
Julie
realized
what
fans
found
so
appealing
about
her
and
insured
her
B
bosom
for
I've
decided
it's
my
most
valuable
asset
she
said
I
want
some
kind
of
guarantee
that
if
I
lose
my
bust
either
if
I
lose
valuable
inches
or
it
gets
too
big
then
I
can
claim
for
it
As
a
barmaid
I'm
expected
to
show
plenty
of
cleavage
It
certainly
helps
having
a
good
bustline
My
legs
are
not
bad
but
it's
my
bust
that
brings
in
the
most
comments
in
my
fan
mail
Everyone
seems
to
think
it's
the
nicest
part
of
me
One
night
actor
Fred
Feast
who
played
potman
Fred
Gee
got
a
flash
of
her
famous
bosom
He
said
She
knew
men
couldn't
take
their
eyes
off
her
boobs
and
she
would
flaunt
them
Once
after
I
helped
her
learn
a
difficult
scene
she
said
Thanks
Fred
here's
your
reward
Then
she
lifted
up
her
sweater
and
gave
me
a
flash
of
her
boobs
She's
got
the
best
pair
I've
ever
seen

Eh
Dustin
Who
As
soon
as
things
are
really
good
I
always
have
a
feeling
the
rug
is
about
to
be
pulled
out
from
under
me
IT
COULD
BE
argued
that
Dustin
owes
his
great
fame
in
part
to
the
Lancashire
playwright
Henry
Livings
Having
just
lost
out
to
Alan
Alda
in
for
the
forthcoming
Broadway
comedy
The
Apple
Tree
directed
by
Mike
Nichols
but
nonetheless
now
confirmed
as
a
top
off-Broadway
character
actor
Dustin
landed
the
lead
in
Livings
Eh
which
had
had
a
great
success
at
the
Aldwych
Theatre
London
in
Peter
Hall's
Royal
Shakespeare
Company
production
exactly
two
years
previously
It
was
the
year-old
writer's
fifth
play
after
Stop
It
Whoever
You
Are
Big
Soft
Nellie
Nil
Carborundum
and
Kelly's
Eye
none
of
them
making
the
voyage
across
the
Atlantic
Eh
seemed
just
as
unlikely
to
find
itself
transported
to
America
The
title
alone
would
give
Americans
some
trouble
Why
did
it
have
a
question
mark
Eh!
meant
ugh!
not
as
in
England
hey
or
ay
In
France
it
was
called
Hein
There
was
fear
that
their
indifference
to
the
play
might
be
expressed
as
Eh!
Who
cares
But
a
few
months
before
its
off-Broadway
opening
Eh
had
had
its
successful
American
premiere
at
the
Playhouse
in
the
Park
in
Cincinnati
Ohio
in
which
year-old
Sam
Waterston
played
the
lead
to
the
author's
supreme
satisfaction
However
Livings
was
not
in
the
USA
to
see
Dustin
and
a
cast
which
included
Dana
Elcar
Elizabeth
Wilson
who
would
play
Dustin's
mother
in
The
Graduate
and
Carl
Gabler
when
it
opened
at
Circle-In-The-Square
at
Bleeker
Street
on
October
Again
it
was
touch
and
go
whether
Dustin
would
be
fired
before
the
first
night
Theodore
Mann
co-founder
and
producer
of
Circle-In-The-Square
since
had
seen
Dustin
on
stage
and
wanted
him
badly
enough
to
have
dismissed
two
directors
instead
of
the
actor
Melvin
Bernhardt
who
had
directed
the
show
in
Cincinnati
was
sacked
after
differences
of
opinion
with
Dustin
The
conflict
with
the
second
director
derived
from
his
wanting
Dustin
to
play
the
role
of
Valentine
Brose
just
as
David
Warner
had
done
in
the
London
production
Dustin
refused
not
only
because
he
had
not
seen
the
very
different
Warner
which
the
director
had
but
he
justifiably
felt
he
had
to
find
his
own
direction
even
if
he
had
to
make
a
number
of
detours
on
the
way
Some
years
later
Dustin
would
work
with
Warner
on
Straw
Dogs
and
they
were
able
to
compare
notes
Enter
Alan
Arkin
Although
Arkin
who
had
created
the
role
of
Harry
Berlin
in
Murray
Schisgal's
Luv
in
in
Mike
Nichols's
production
had
directed
sketches
in
revue
he
had
never
directed
a
legitimate
play
before
Because
of
his
inexperience
and
the
firing
of
the
two
previous
directors
he
asked
to
do
it
under
another
name
not
wanting
to
take
the
rap
for
a
flop
So
he
called
himself
Roger
Short
Dustin
was
a
jazz
enthusiast
and
found
out
that
Arkin
was
too
So
I
went
up
to
him
It
was
the
first
time
we
made
a
connection
s
And
I
said
I
know
why
you
picked
the
name
Roger
Short
because
Shorty
Rogers
did
an
album
once
on
a
label
he
wasn't
supposed
to
and
changed
his
name
from
Shorty
Rogers
to
Roger
Short
Rogers
was
to
provide
the
music
for
Dustin's
very
first
film
We
had
the
same
sense
of
humour
We
had
a
lot
in
common
and
we
liked
each
other
and
he
was
one
of
the
best
directors
I
ever
had
Arkin
allowed
Dustin
time
to
find
the
character
himself
There
are
two
kinds
of
difficult
people
in
the
theatre
Arkin
pronounced
Those
who
are
passionate
about
their
work
and
those
who
are
passionate
about
themselves
Dustin
is
passionate
about
his
work
In
order
to
try
and
get
a
Northern
English
accent
Dustin
went
to
see
the
Beatles
in
A
Hard
Day's
Night
about
a
dozen
times
determined
to
sound
like
those
guys
No
matter
that
his
approximation
to
Liverpudlian
was
not
what
Livings
had
in
mind
for
the
character
it
made
no
difference
to
American
audiences
who
were
not
well
up
on
the
variations
of
British
speech
patterns
Actually
Dustin
although
masterful
in
changing
the
timbre
of
his
voice
to
suit
different
parts
only
rarely
attempts
to
put
on
anything
other
than
an
American
accent
Henry
Livings
describes
the
character
of
Valentine
Brose
as
pale
and
totally
lacking
in
human
fire
He
behaves
excitedly
on
occasion
even
frenetically
and
he
wears
gaudy
cheap
clothes
with
some
dash
It's
as
if
he
were
giving
a
performance
of
some
character
he's
dreamed
up
and
his
pale
eyes
wander
in
search
of
effect
even
in
his
apparently
wildest
moments
The
play
revolves
around
Brose
a
harebrained
nonentity
machine-operator
who
runs
a
boiler
room
of
a
semi-automated
antiseptic
dye
factory
having
taken
the
job
because
it
was
easy
work
and
non-union
and
who
manages
to
annoy
everybody
except
his
fianc
e
He
has
brought
with
him
some
psychedelic
mushrooms
to
grow
at
work
When
his
superior
comes
across
the
boxes
clearly
marked
Mushrooms
Brose
replies
that
this
actually
means
M
U
Shrooms
Mervyn
Ulrich
Shrooms
seed
merchant
By
the
end
people
have
turned
on
and
the
boiler
room
blows
up
Eliot
Fremont-Smith

book
critic
of
The
New
York
Times
wrote
that
All
involved
deserve
laurels
But
because
it
is
essentially
Brose's
show
the
biggest
should
go
to
Mr
Hoffman
who
must
be
reckoned
one
of
the
most
agile
and
subtly
controlled
comedians
around
He
carries
the
show
and
even
if
Eh
still
doesn't
sound
enticing
he
should
be
seen
On
the
Sunday
morning
after
the
opening
Dustin
spread
out
The
New
York
Times
on
the
sidewalk
and
saw
a
half-page
picture
of
himself
illustrating
a
long
article
by
Walter
Kerr
the
most
esteemed
American
critic
of
the
day
then
only
doing
weekend
pieces
In
glowing
terms
Kerr
equated
Dustin
with
Buster
Keaton
Stunned
Dustin
felt
it
was
the
single
greatest
moment
I
had
as
an
actor
Dustin
who
had
barely
seen
Keaton
tried
to
catch
some
of
his
films
Fortunately
it
was
the
period
when
Keaton
was
just
being
rediscovered
There
are
some
moments
in
Dustin's
films
that
could
be
called
Keatonesque
the
blankness
of
his
face
at
the
beginning
of
The
Graduate
some
of
the
comedy
in
Little
Big
Man
and
the
office
party
scene
in
Kramer
vs
Kramer
without
his
face
ever
resembling
Keaton's
handsome
stone-face
features
British
playwright
John
Arden
he
of
Sergeant
Musgrave's
Dance
accepted
the
Obie
on
Henry
Livings's
behalf
though
commented
Livings
In
his
mild
way
John
hinted
I
might
well
not
have
enjoyed
the
way
it
was
done
in
New
York
but
I
never
argue
with
box-office
returns
Livings
thought
it
might
have
lacked
the
English
music-hall
style
of
comedy
he
wished
to
capture
One
adverse
critic
of
Dustin's
performance
was
the
young
and
eccentric
English
actor
Victor
Henry
who
on
seeing
Dustin
in
a
bar
after
the
show
emptied
a
glass
of
beer
over
his
head
Henry
was
a
great
friend
of
the
playwright
and
decided
that
Dustin
had
misread
a
line
Tragically
Victor
Henry
died
in
aged
his
last
fourteen
years
spent
in
silence
after
a
street
accident
Dustin
never
forgot
the
importance
of
Henry
Livings's
play
in
his
career
and
many
years
later
when
he
was
making
Agatha
in
England
he
sought
the
modest
playwright
out
and
took
him
to
lunch
at
a
smart
restaurant
Dustin
introduced
Livings
to
his
business
manager
the
London
boxing
promoter
Jarvis
Astaire
who
took
me
into
his
offices
recalled
Livings
and
en
passant
introduced
me
to
a
chap
standing
at
a
window
ledge
in
a
corridor
typing
This
is
one
of
our
writers
says
he
It
seemed
a
good
time
to
make
my
excuses
and
leave
and
I
did
both
Almost
immediately
following
the
opening
of
Eh
Dustin
was
given
his
first
chance
to
be
in
pictures
I
got
there
at
ten
a.m
and
was
done
by
one
p.m
Then
I
phoned
everybody
and
said
Well
I
just
finished
my
first
movie
The
Tiger
Makes
Out
was
a
fleshed-out
version
of
Murray
Schisgal's
one-act
play
The
Tiger
about
a
sexually
repressed
New
York
mailman
played
by
Eli
Wallach
who
attempts
to
kidnap
a
sexy
swinger
only
to
end
up
capturing
Anne
Jackson
Mrs
Wallach
a
socially
repressed
Long
Island
housewife
Wallach
and
Jackson
repeated
their
stage
roles
while
cameos
were
taken
by
stars
and
friends
of
the
writer
Filmed
on
location
in
Manhattan
this
shoestring
Columbia
Picture
comedy
provided
a
modicum
of
wacky
New
York
humour
It
was
released
on
September
with
a
nineteenth-billed
Dustin
Hoffman
As
long-haired
Hap
one
of
a
pair
of
beatnik
lovers
wearing
a
polo-neck
sweater
and
a
raincoat
Dustin's
second
moment
comes
when
he
is
seen
breaking
up
with
his
girlfriend
Mariclare
Costello
before
she
wanders
off
to
be
almost
grabbed
by
the
preying
Wallach
It's
no
good
any
more
Rosie
Dustin
moans
You
mope
around
the
house
I'm
not
going
to
any
more
she
pleads
It's
just
no
good
Rosie
he
continues
You
fill
me
with
guilt
I'm
not
asking
you
to
marry
me
she
insists
I'm
perfectly
content
to
go
on
living
with
you
under
the
original
terms
We
split
all
the
expenses
and
live
together
What's
so
terrible
about
that
What's
so
terrible
Dustin
protests
I'm
the
one
who
has
to
carry
the
guilt
around
I'm
the
guilty
one
Goodbye

The
film's
director
Arthur
Hiller
had
previously
seen
Dustin
in
Journey
of
the
Fifth
Horse
and
was
bowled
over
by
how
convincing
and
skilful
he
was
playing
an
elderly
man
Needless
to
say
he
showed
those
special
talents
again
playing
a
young
man
in
his
twenties
in
our
film
Indeed
I
remember
Murray
Schisgal
saying
to
me
That
man
will
be
a
major
star
Dustin
and
Schisgal
had
met
earlier
in
August
at
the
Berkshire
Theater
Festival
in
Stockbridge
Massachusetts
where
Dustin
acted
in
a
number
of
Schisgal
plays
the
Old
Jew
in
the
play
of
that
name
Max
in
Reverberations
changed
later
to
The
Basement
and
Jax
in
Fragments
Gene
Hackman
was
to
feature
in
the
plays
when
they
got
to
New
York
It
was
the
start
of
a
beautiful
friendship
Schisgal
was
to
become
godfather
to
two
of
Dustin's
children
Jacob
and
Rebecca
some
years
hence
and
they
would
also
form
a
long-standing
working
relationship
Murray
Schisgal
was
born
in
Brooklyn
in
November
After
serving
in
the
navy
during
World
War
II
he
performed
as
a
musician
with
small
jazz
groups
practised
law
for
several
years
then
taught
in
public
and
private
schools
His
career
as
a
playwright
began
with
three
one-act
plays
The
Typists
The
Postman
later
changed
to
The
Tiger
and
A
Simple
Kind
of
Love
Story
which
was
first
produced
by
expatriate
American
Charles
Marowitz
at
his
tiny
Open
Space
Theatre
in
London
and
then
off-Broadway
When
Luv
opened
at
the
Booth
Theater
in
with
Wallach
Jackson
and
Arkin
Walter
Kerr
over-enthusiastically
claimed
it
was
better
than
Waiting
for
Godot
During
the
theatre
festival
the
author
liked
to
take
early-morning
walks
and
every
day
when
he
left
his
hotel
Dustin
would
be
waiting
for
him
He'd
have
the
script
and
a
million
questions
to
ask
What's
your
thought
here
What's
your
thought
there
I
had
never
worked
with
an
actor
like
that
He
is
eternally
dissatisfied
with
what
he
has
achieved
While
Eh
was
still
running
Dustin
signed
to
star
in
the
low-budget
Italian-Spanish
Madigan's
Millions
El
Testamento
de
Madigan/Un
Dollaro
per
Vigliacchi
to
be
shot
in
Rome
from
April
for
which
he
would
receive
George
Raft
originally
set
to
take
the
non-speaking
title
role
turned
down
the
offer
before
shooting
reportedly
because
of
ill
health
and
was
replaced
by
Cesar
Romero
in
what
was
barely
a
cameo
Dustin
played
Jason
Fister
a
bumbling
undercover
Treasury
agent
sent
to
Italy
to
locate
gangster
Madigan's
ill-gotten
millions
thereby
becoming
embroiled
in
a
series
of
slapstick
mishaps
Amidst
the
unhilarious
mayhem
a
bespectacled
and
wide-eyed
Dustin
managed
to
time
a
few
gags
well
but
became
swamped
by
the
strained
and
desperate
elements
of
the
ridiculous
plot
The
draggy
love
interest
was
provided
by
Elsa
Martinelli
who
plays
Romero's
daughter
although
Dustin
thinks
she
was
his
lover
This
schlocky
international
movie
photographed
in
eye-straining
colour
cashing
in
figuratively
speaking
on
the
craze
for
James
Bond
pictures
was
shot
in
three
languages
with
a
different
director
credited
for
each
version
Stanley
Prager
English
Dan
Ash
Italian
and
Giorgio
Gentil
Spanish
Prager
who
died
aged
in
had
been
an
actor
in
Fox
films
in
the
forties
directed
Neil
Simon's
first
Broadway
play
Come
Blow
Your
Horn
and
had
helmed
the
popular
TV
comedy
Car
Where
Are
You
Who
the
other
two
directors
were
and
whether
they
were
justifiably
hiding
behind
pseudonyms
is
a
matter
for
conjecture
Madigan's
Millions
was
held
back
from
release
until
American
International
Pictures
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
success
of
Midnight
Cowboy
by
foisting
it
on
to
the
public
in
in
a
double
bill
with
Jon
Voight's
early
indiscretion
Fearless
Frank
also
made
in
Shamelessly
AIP
publicised
it
as
The
Two
Most
Incredible
New
Comedies
Ever
Laughed
At!
Voight
came
off
the
better
of
the
two
because
Fearless
Frank
originally
called
Frank's
Greatest
Adventure
was
the
more
interesting
in
being
Phil
Kaufman's
debut
as
director
and
having
the
author
Nelson
The
Man
with
the
Golden
Arm
Algren
playing
a
gangster
called
Needles
Variety
commented
on
Madigan's
Millions
that
had
it
been
released
earlier
it
might
have
finished

would

in
what
would

been
the
most

in

History
was
thus
made
at

in
St

as
often
happens
only
by
a
fractional
twist
of
the
law

so

was
able
to
enjoy
a
much
better
night's
sleep
than
the
previous
one
when
he
tossed

turned
from
a.m
onwards
Would

be
in

Lara
hardly
dared
think
about
becoming
the
ninth
man
to
carry
the
baton
in
years
especially
as
the
first
seven
men
held
it
for
years
between
them
with
Foster's
years
the
longest
period
of
ownership
until
Sobers
He
had
won
it
years
earlier
and
the
possibility
of
him
handing
it
over
made
sleep
impossible
Early
dawn
is
an
unforgiving
time
for
the
worried
mind
even
one
which
could
look
back
on
an
overnight
unbeaten
score
of
Most
cricketers
profess
to
be
ignorant
and
uncaring
of
records
but
the
truth
is
usually
different
As
with
Lara
who
in
his
room
at
the
Ramad
Royal
Antiguan
Hotel
mentally
listed
the
landmarks
ahead
of
him
in
the
next
few
hours
The
first
run
of
the
morning
would
maintain
a
Test
average
of
and
the
first
boundary
would
take
him
past
runs
for
the
series
Graham
Gooch's
was
runs
away
and
he
could
then
knock
off
Bradman
Hammond
and
Hanif
Mohammad
with
one
boundary
Left
then
would
be
Hutton
and
Sobers
the
latter
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
alongside
the
flag
marked
which
had
flown
proudly
for
years
When
Lara
arrived
at
the
ground
the
tension-filled
atmosphere
was
winding
up
to
a
drum-tight
level
Crowds
poured
in
from
a.m
onwards
Radio
and

stations
were
full
of
it

was
also
there
But
for

on
the
second
day
which
caused

to
restart

innings
three
extra
times
his
date
with

would
have
been
kept
but
the
weather

are
no
respecters
of
sport
They
took
overs
out
of
the
day
but
although
they
relented
on
the
third
morning
they
cost
him
most
of
his
sleep
during
Sunday
night
He
started
edgily
and
soon
had
the
third
new
ball
to
deal
with
after
two
overs
His
first
stroke
against
it
lobbed
one
from

then
played

missed
at

from

only
the

who
was
there
and
thousands
who
were

will
claim
they
were
in
years
to
come
have
had
their
say
about
the
innings
and
more
than
one
person
echoes
the
view
of
the
senior
commentator
in
the
Caribbean
Tony
Cozier
At
the
end
of
the
first
day
when
Lara
was
not
out
he
wrote
The
sterling
for
the
first
batsman
to
score
a
double-hundred
in
the
series
is
all
but
in
his
bank
account
By
tea-time
this
afternoon
the
consideration
might
well
be
directed
to
a
less
lucrative
but
far
more
prestigious
prize

Gary
Sobers

record
of
On
yesterday's
evidence
it
is
not
a
ridiculous
thought
and
Sir
Gary
is
here
to
follow
his
successor's
progress
I
have
reported
dozens
of
innings
at
a
similar
stage
but
never
felt
so
certain
that
something
extraordinary
was
developing
It
was
a
sixth
sense
shared
by
one
or
two
journalists
in
the
press
box
And
by
the
England
Captain
Atherton
later
agreed
that
the
innings
smacked
of
the
inevitable
Before
Lara
only
scores
of
over
had
been
registered
in
Test
cricket
with
Bradman
the
only
man
to
do
it
twice
The
innings
statistics
show
that
Lara
faced
balls
batted
for
and
a
half
hours
and
hit
fours
on
a

grass
outfield
The
bat
he
used
was
oddly
enough
one
returned
to
him
after
being
stolen
in
Port-of-Spain
in
February
Such
was
his
standing
on
his
native
island
even
before
the
that
as
soon
as
the
miscreant
knew
the
identity
of
his
victim
he
put
the
matter
right
immediately
even
though
it
meant
transporting
the
kit-bag
to
Jamaica
Like
his
epic
innings
in
Sydney
months
earlier
Lara
came
in
to
bat
with
his
side
in
trouble
This
time
they
were
for
one
which
was
soon
for
two
and
with
no
Haynes
or
Richie
Richardson
playing
because
of
injury
he
walked
proudly
in
to
take
guard
as
the
temporarily
appointed
Vice-Captain
Of
the
next
runs
scored
Adams
Arthurton
and
Chanderpaul
scored
from
balls
arguably
the
most
staggering
comparative
statistic
of
them
all
Lara's
immediate
public
reaction
was
typically
low-key
full
of
declared
intentions
which
were
soon
to
be
put
to
a
test
he
would
pass
and
pass
again
with
flying
colours
I
think
the
public
will
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
me
and
I'll
have
to
live
up
to
what
I
have
done
today
and
what
I've
done
in
the
past
Just
that
is
enough
inspiration
to
keep
going
I
know
that
because
I
have
the
world
record
people
will
be
expecting
a
lot
and
I
can't
afford
to
disappoint
them
More
cautiously
he
said
There
are
times
when
I
shall
fail
and
I
hope
that
people
understand
that
I'm
just
a
human
being
and
it
takes
one
ball
to
get
you
out
From
now
on
I'll
be
going
out
just
to
maintain
what
I've
done
today
and
maintain
my
career
He
flew
back
to
Trinidad
after
the
Test
ended
on
Thursday
April
and
the
reception
awaiting
him
at
Piarco
International
airport
was
the
start
of
a
merry-go-round
which
would
whirl
ever
faster
in
the
months
of
May
and
June
Prime
Minister
Patrick
Manning
was
there
to
greet
him
and
the
gifts
started
to
pour
in
BWIA
International
gave
him
TT$375
of
free
travel
roughly
and
a
cellular
telephone
company
gave
him
minutes
of
free
air
time
A
soap
company
chipped
in
with
TT$37
and
a
free
new
house
from
the
government
was
promised
A
street
in
Independence
Square
was
renamed
Brian
Lara
Promenade
and
all
schools
were
given
the
following
day
off
to
watch
their
hero
lead
a
motorcade
tour
of
the
island
It
started
in
Arima
in
central
Trinidad
but
such
were
the
crowds
his
journey
to
the
City
Hall
to
receive
the
keys
of
the
city
took
more
than
two
hours
The
tour
finished
at
the
Queen's
Park
Oval
where
happy
schoolchildren
had
waited
for
more
than
three
hours
in
sweltering
heat
That
evening
he
attended
a
reception
at
the
Prime
Minister's
residence
and
the
next
day
together
with
Sobers
was
presented
with
the
Trinity
Cross
the
island's
highest
honour
Tour
followed
tour
including
one
to
his
own
Santa
Cruz
followed
by
visits
to
the
southern
towns
of
Chaguanas
and
San
Fernando
That
left
the
twin
island
of
Tobago
with
this
visit
delaying
his
return
to
Trinidad
causing
him
to
miss
his
flight
to
England
where
he
was
due
to
arrive
by
Tuesday
April
Seats
on
later
planes
were
full
but
the
power
of
his
name
enabled
him
to
arrive
finally
at
Edgbaston
on
Wednesday
April
less
than
hours
before
the
start
of
his
first
game
since
the
Antigua
Test
match
The
world's
media
had
now
got
him
firmly
in
their
sights
He
dominated
the
sports
pages
in
many
countries
and
many
front
pages
as
well
Even
several
editorials
in
British
national
newspapers
switched
from
their
normal
political
and
economic
themes
More
locally
his
own
island's
Daily
Express
ran
a
page
special
Tribute
to
Brian
Lara
and
the
Daily
Nation
of
Barbados
printed
eight
pages
of
stories
and
pictures
Jamaica's
Gleaner
was
fortunate
to
have
Tony
Becker
writing
about
Lara
because
Becker
was
the
only
journalist
to
have
seen
Sobers
set
the
then
new
record
at
Sabina
Park
years
earlier
Most
Australian
newspapers
used
headlines
referring
to
the
picture
of
Lara
kissing
the
pitch
on
the
Recreation
Ground
Sealed
with
a
kiss
was
the
popular
choice
In
India
he
was
given
front-page
prominence
ahead
of
that
country's
progress
in
the
Australasia
Cup
in
Sharjah
and
Canadian
newspapers
gave
splash
coverage
to
his
feat
for
their
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
West
Indian
immigrants
Even
America
was
drawn
in
although
newscaster
Nick
Charles
on
cable
network
CNN
admitted
that
he
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
after
doing
a
voice-over
on
the
stroke
which
clinched
the
record
for
his
station's
Michelin
Play
of
the
Day
By
then
Lara
had
learned
that
he
had
an
eyesight
problem
Incredible
as
it
seems
for
a
young
man
blessed
with
such
exceptional
reflexes
he
suffers
from
pterygium
which
causes
a
light
film
to
spread
from
the
corner
of
the
eye
towards
the
cornea
This
was
diagnosed
during
the
second
Test
in
Georgetown
when
Lara
complained
of
irritation
and
itchiness
in
his
eyes
He
was
told
that
the
condition
peculiar
to
hot
dry
countries
necessitated
an
operation
which
would
be
done
before
he
toured
India
with
the
West
Indies
towards
the
end
of
What
might
he
have
achieved
had
he
been
able
to
see
what
he
was
doing

THE
PRICE
OF
FAME
In
the
two
short
years
that
followed
her
first
record
Kylie
became
one
of
the
entertainment
phenomena
of
the
s
In
alone
she
sold
a
remarkable
million
worth
of
records
around
the
world
earning
herself
around
million
She
was
garnering
awards
from
Japan
to
Israel
and
Ireland
embarking
on
a
movie
career
that
seemed
certain
to
lead
to
Hollywood
stardom
she
had
even
achieved
the
final
confirmation
of
her
status
as
a
member
of
the
lite
band
entitled
to
call
themselves
superstars
a
wax
image
of
herself
at
Madame
Tussaud's
Yet
as
her
Five
Star
lifestyle
moved
further
and
further
away
from
the
modest
suburban
existence
of
Surrey
Hills
Melbourne
Kylie
was
also
learning
another
lesson
She
was
discovering
that
there
was
truth
in
one
of
showbusiness's
most
hackneyed
old
sayings
Fame
costs
There
were
so
many
among
her
High
School
and
Neighbours
friends
who
were
amazed
at
the
way
the
shy
fragile
far
from
self-confident
Kylie
coped
with
her
instant
elevation
to
international
celebrity
It
seemed
incongruous
to
them
that
the
sweet
teenager
they
knew
was
not
only
surviving
life
in
the
toughest
of
all
trades
but
that
she
was
also
winning
something
of
a
reputation
as
a
tough
cookie
a
determined
career
girl
refusing
to
be
deflected
from
her
dreams
When
in
soon
after
she
had
left
Neighbours
to
devote
herself
full
time
to
her
music
the
cookie
looked
like
it
was
beginning
to
crumble
many
shook
their
heads
knowingly
The
biggest
crisis
in
her
until
then
trouble-free
career
came
during
a
recording
session
in
her
home
town
It
was
as
if
all
of
a
sudden
all
the
hidden
anxieties
and
fears
she
had
hidden
so
expertly
were
now
overwhelming
her
Kylie
ran
sobbing
out
of
the
studios
and
did
what
was
still
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
a
year-old
girl
she
ran
home
to
mummy
I
was
so
sick
I
had
to
take
a
day
off
It
gave
me
a
few
minutes
to
stop
and
think
about
what
the
hell
I
was
doing
I
felt
What
am
I
doing
here
I
would
rather
have
a
little
shop
a
holiday
home
and
be
getting
married
and
having
kids
There
was
just
so
much
pressure
from
so
many
different
people
I
just
had
to
say
Stop
I
had
everything
but
I
had
nothing
It's
true
what
they
say
about
that
I
am
the
sort
of
person
I
would
like
to
be
a
bus
driver
work
in
a
nursery
I
would
like
to
do
everything
she
said
Her
near
nervous
breakdown
which
took
her
to
the
brink
of
giving
up
all
she
had
worked
for
in
showbusiness
was
all
the
more
surprising
to
outsiders
given
it
happened
in
her
native
Australia
Yet
it
was
her
own
countrymen
who
first
demonstrated
the
tall
poppy
syndrome
she
had
herself
foretold
The
Singing
Budgie
and
We
Hate
Kylie
campaign
had
at
first
seemed
impotent
against
the
simple
unquenchable
ambition
of
Kylie
But
she
admitted
it
eventually
broke
through
her
defences
She
confessed
that
the
bitter
jibes
and
over-exposure
led
her
to
the
precipice
They
called
me
things
like
plastic
person
and
a
bimbo
I
am
not
stupid
If
I
was
stupid
I
don't
think
I
would
have
got
this
far
I
was
sick
of
seeing
myself
on
television
so
I
thought
the
poor
public
how
are
they
going
to
cope
It's
over-kill
That's
when
the
public
turned
against
me
But
I
was
contracted
I
couldn't
stop
I
had
to
keep
going
Asked
during
those
dark
days
whether
she
had
ever
felt
like
quitting
showbusiness
she
replied
I
would
have
loved
to
but
I
couldn't
It
is
an
indication
of
how
low
Kylie's
emotional
defences
were
during
this
crisis
that
just
for
once
the
intensely
personal
details
of
her
life
suddenly
came
gushing
out
as
if
to
exorcise
some
spirit
that
was
within
her
She
talked
of
the
spectre
of
Pre
Menstrual
Tension
and
how
it
blighted
her
life
I
cry
sometimes
I
am
strong
and
sometimes
I
burst
into
tears
Actually
I
am
very
emotional
God
forbid
when
I
PMT
you
wouldn't
want
to
come
near
me
I
am
horrible
One
person
who
claimed
to
have
witnessed
her
collapse
in
the
recording
studio
said
The
poor
kid
just
kept
sobbing
and
saying
I
can't
go
on
I
can't
take
the
pressure
But
the
silly
girl
just
a
couple
of
days
later
she
was
back
recording
again
With
Kylie
at
her
most
vulnerable
this
was
also
the
time
when
those
who
most
despised
her
success
happily
fuelled
rumours
that
she
was
anorexic
Reports
claimed
that
the
elfin
figured
star's
weight
plunged
terrifyingly
until
she
tipped
the
scales
at
a
mere
five
stones
They
alleged
that
Kylie
confessed
I
honestly
thought
I
was
going
to
fade
right
away
It
was
becoming
a
desperately
serious
problem
At
first
it
was
just
that
I
was
too
busy
to
find
time
to
eat
Then
I
got
so
that
I
could
not
be
bothered
And
then
it
got
to
the
stage
when
I
did
not
want
to
she
is
alleged
to
have
said
There
are
always
pressures
on
kids
my
age
to
diet
and
I
am
no
different
from
the
rest
But
it
was
turning
into
a
very
very
serious
problem
And
only
my
family
saved
me
They
finally
forced
me
to
seek
help
When
my
doctor
saw
me
and
heard
how
much
I
was
working
and
about
the
rest
of
my
life
he
was
absolutely
horrified
It
was
stress
more
than
anything
that
affected
me
I
could
not
keep
up
with
the
demands
of
trying
to
keep
everyone
happy
and
in
desperation
to
make
sure
I
keep
my
looks
I
gave
up
eating
she
is
alleged
to
have
said
It
was
claimed
that
Kylie
was
placed
on
a
special
calorie
a
day
diet
to
try
to
replace
the
lost
weight
Kylie
reportedly
admitted
in
November
that
she
had
the
problem
back
under
control
Talking
of
the
torment
she
was
then
emerging
from
she
said
The
demands
never
end
You
are
really
giving
away
a
part
of
yourself
You
can't
even
go
down
the
street
like
anyone
else
If
you
are
in
an
office
job
you
can
usually
go
home
and
leave
your
job
behind
I
can't
And
you
can't
get
too
comfortable
with
where
you
are
because
you
could
be
a
nobody
tomorrow
When
I
am
tired
and
think
I
don't
want
to
do
this
any
more
I
just
tell
myself
that
it
might
not
be
here
in
a
few
months
and
that
there's
probably
a
million
who
would
kill
to
be
where
I
am
It
is
lonely
at
the
top
sometimes
most
kids
my
age
don't
have
a
care
in
the
world
They
can
go
on
the
hippy
trail
up
the
coast
that's
something
I
have
missed
out
on
I
wish
I
could
have
done
it
A
lot
of
my
old
school
friends
are
doing
that
now
and
they
are
just
hanging
loose
without
a
care
in
the
world
it
sounds
great
But
there
are
so
many
people
who
want
me
to
do
things
and
I
feel
I
can't
let
them
down
I
get
home
and
I
have
no
time
to
myself
I
have
to
learn
things
or
sign
cards
for
fans
If
I
lived
alone
I
would
nearly
go
crazy
I
would
feel
very
lonely
I
simply
don't
get
out
much
to
enjoy
my
success
There
is
an
enormous
amount
of
pressure
on
me
Sometimes
it
gets
to
me
I
give
so
much
time
and
energy
to
everyone
else
that
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
That
is
when
I
think
What
about
me
Am
I
meant
to
be
the
centre
of
all
this
I
know
I
am
only
but
some
days
I
feel
about
so
much
has
happened
to
me
But
there
was
a
more
sinister
side
too
The
rich
and
famous
and
Kylie
by
now
was
both
will
always
be
magnets
for
those
disturbed
characters
like
John
Lennon's
slayer
Mark
Chapman
psychotics
infatuated
with
the
darker
side
of
Andy
Warhol's
chilling
message
everyone
can
be
famous
for
minutes
From
the
early
days
Kylie
was
plagued
by
obscene
phone
calls
and
hate
mail
During
her
days
on
Neighbours
she
recalled
how
people
were
only
too
willing
to
vent
their
jealousies
publicly
Once
I
was
out
shopping
with
a
girlfriend
and
we
went
into
a
store
Suddenly
a
woman
just
came
in
marched
up
to
us
stuck
her
face
in
mine
and
spat
Neighbours
sucks
Then
she
turned
round
obviously
very
pleased
with
herself
and
walked
off
I
stood
there
very
amazed
but
very
upset
Why
do
people
do
these
things
Afterwards
I
told
myself
Who
cares
what
she
thinks
If
she
doesn't
like
the
show
she
shouldn't
watch
it
said
Kylie
The
personal
abuse
continued
when
Kylie
made
her
base
in
London
Producer
Peter
Waterman
once
had
to
rescue
his
starlet
from
a
gang
of
teenagers
when
they
began
spitting
at
her
in
a
nightclub
It
is
very
difficult
for
me
I
remember
being
pretty
shy
at
school
and
I
think
I
still
am
All
the
pressures
of
people
having
a
go
at
me
all
the
time
don't
help
said
Kylie
For
the
media
clamouring
for
every
sensational
scrap
of
information
about
Kylie
good
or
bad
the
troubles
she
endured
during
this
period
were
mass
circulation
manna
from
heaven
Even
if
the
stories
weren't
true
In
October
stories
began
circulating
that
Kylie
had
been
the
victim
of
a
crazed
sex-attacker
It
was
reported
that
she
disturbed
the
prowler
when
she
arrived
back
unexpectedly
at
her
family's
Melbourne
home
Only
a
desperate
battle
with
the
intruder
prevented
her
becoming
the
seventh
victim
of
the
molester
who
was
that
at
the
top
of
the
Melbourne
police
most
wanted
list
It
was
claimed
that
the
police
investigated
the
attack
which
happened
as
Kylie
returned
to
Australia
after
another
of
her
visits
to
Britain
She
took
a
taxi
to
the
family
home
in
Surry
Hills
and
let
herself
into
the
house
which
was
unoccupied
She
walked
into
the
lounge
the
report
said
to
be
confronted
with
the
masked
intruder
She
began
screaming
and
in
desperation
threw
ornaments
and
bottles
He
made
his
escape
by
diving
headlong
through
a
porch
window
Kylie
however
vehemently
refuses
to
ever
discuss
the
alleged
incident
Friends
within
the
Neighbours
cast
were
said
to
have
claimed
the
attack
left
Kylie
badly
shaken
up
She
was
terrified
that
the
guy
had
gone
looking
specifically
for
her
It
is
a
constant
risk
for
someone
like
her
who
is
always
in
the
public
eye
that
someone
will
develop
a
fixation
on
her
the
colleague
said
More
simple
salutary
lessons
were
being
learned
in
Britain
too
There
perhaps
more
than
anywhere
else
the
hunger
for
tabloid
trivia
never
seemed
to
satisfy
the
public
When
Kylie
went
shopping
for
more
additions
to
her
by
now
Imelda
Marcos
scale
wardrobe
in
one
of
London's
stores
the
result
was
inevitable
Kylie
screams
abuse
at
shop
staff
the
banner
headlines
blared
They
insisted
she
had
insulted
counter
girls
after
she
had
been
refused
discount
on
a
slinky
black
evening
dress
which
she
saw
hanging
on
a
rail
in
the
fashionable
Hyper
Hyper
clothes
store
in
London's
Kensington
High
Street
To
other
shoppers
in
the
store
at
the
same
time
such
stories
were
shocking
Top
cosmetic
company
boss
Angela
Boxer
protested
I
don't
understand
why
they
were
doing
this
to
the
poor
girl
She
did
not
deserve
being
pilloried
like
that
at
all
I
bought
the
dress
she
was
looking
at
and
chatted
to
her
about
it
She
was
polite
and
didn't
make
any
fuss
at
all
She
was
not
at
all
the
uppity
self-important
celebrity
I
read
about
the
next
day
I
could
not
believe
the
headlines
She
was
doing
her
best
not
to
be
noticed
Wearing
jeans
and
bomber
jacket
with
no
make-up
she
wasn't
trying
to
be
a
big
deal
at
all
I
thought
she
was
really
very
nice
and
my
opinion
was
formed
from
that
one
meeting
with
her
by
pure
accident
It
was
not
the
person
I
had
read
about
in
all
the
papers
and
magazines
But
to
Kylie
the
incident
was
just
a
re-run
of
thousands
she
had
lived
through
before
She
had
always
accepted
the
unwritten
law
of
the
pop
jungle
all
publicity
is
good
publicity
and
no
matter
what
the
excuses
she
needed
the
headlines
as
much
as
their
writers
needed
her
She
regularly
conceded
it
was
all
part
of
the
game
she
was
involved
in
All
she
needed
to
do
now
was
put
her
troubled
times
behind
her
and
win
the
game

Monday
November
Eve
of
Poll
On
Monday
the
day
before
the
election
I
spoke
to
John
Wakeham
an
experienced
hand
who
had
been
Chief
Whip
Leader
of
the
House
and
was
now
Energy
Secretary
and
told
him
early
in
the
morning
that
in
my
view
it
was
going
to
be
very
close
and
we
should
prepare
for
a
second
ballot
We
agreed
to
meet
later
that
morning
to
discuss
this
in
the
Prime
Minister's
room
at
the
House
of
Commons
At
this
meeting
George
Younger
John
Moore
John
Wakeham
Norman
Tebbit
Cranley
Onslow
Tim
Renton
Peter
Morrison
and
Gerry
Neale
were
present
We
assessed
the
possible
results
The
voting
system
was
complicated
To
win
on
the
first
ballot
a
candidate
was
required
to
have
an
overall
majority
of
those
entitled
to
vote
plus
a
per
cent
margin
over
the
next
candidate
Since
the
electoral
college
numbered
votes
then
in
order
to
win
the
Prime
Minister
needed
a
minimum
of
votes
and
to
be
fifty-six
votes
ahead
of
Heseltine
The
difficult
area
lay
where
the
Prime
Minister
got
between
and
votes
while
Heseltine
got
between
and
votes
This
would
mean
a
second
ballot
This
would
be
conducted
along
simpler
lines
with
an
overall
majority
being
sufficient
without
the
requirement
of
an
extra
margin
If
a
third
ballot
was
required
because
of
other
candidates
entering
the
race
then
the
system
used
would
be
the
single
transferable
vote
This
exceptional
and
extraordinary
electoral
system
had
been
devised
by
Humphrey
Berkeley
in
and
it
has
been
much
criticized
However
many
people
around
the
world
marvelled
at
a
procedure
that
allowed
a
Party
with
a
large
overall
majority
to
change
its
popular
and
successful
leader
a
world
figure
within
the
short
space
of
two
weeks
and
without
rancour
and
mayhem
while
remaining
a
united
Party
still
in
office
Although
the
Executive
decided
in
to
change
the
rules
slightly
by
requiring
more
Tory
MPs
to
sign
any
proposal
for
a
leadership
candidate
to
stand
the
rules
have
remained
essentially
the
same
Tim
Renton
felt
that
if
Margaret
won
only
votes
then
she
couldn't
go
on
as
Leader
to
the
second
ballot
with
only
half
the
Parliamentary
Party
supporting
her
Peter
Morrison
maintained
that
she
would
want
to
fight
a
second
round
because
even
with
those
figures
she
would
have
won
the
majority
of
the
votes
cast
If
Margaret
continued
to
stand
then
no
member
of
the
Cabinet
would
be
willing
to
stand
against
her
The
only
possible
new
entrant
of
any
significance
would
be
Geoffrey
Howe
The
discussion
then
turned
to
what
Margaret
should
say
if
there
was
no
decisive
result
Norman
Tebbit
was
certain
saying
If
she
does
not
immediately
make
a
clear
statement
of
her
intent
to
carry
on
then
it
is
a
lost
cause
and
she
has
to
withdraw
So
to
keep
her
options
open
she
must
make
a
clear
statement
George
Younger
said
that
if
the
result
was
inconclusive
then
Several
people
have
told
me
that
she
must
think
very
carefully
as
several
members
of
the
Cabinet
will
advise
her
not
to
go
on
I
put
forward
the
view
which
I
had
earlier
expressed
to
John
Wakeham
that
Margaret
should
not
be
so
definite
I
suggested
three
alternative
statements
for
her
to
make
I
intend
to
let
my
name
go
forward
to
the
second
ballot
I
wish
to
consult
my
colleagues
and
It
would
not
be
appropriate
for
me
to
say
any
more
until
I
return
to
London
I
suggested
the
latter
two
because
much
of
the
criticism
directed
against
Margaret
was
that
she
did
not
consult
her
colleagues
and
it
would
be
better
if
she
said
she
intended
to
return
to
London
to
consult
them
This
would
have
two
advantages
First
the
Heseltine
camp
would
be
thrown
into
confusion
and
secondly
by
the
Wednesday
morning
there
would
be
a
whole
army
of
people
Ministers
Party
officers
and
MPs
marching
to
Downing
Street
insisting
that
Margaret
had
to
continue
However
other
views
prevailed
I
think
that
those
colleagues
thought
my
views
were
too
defeatist
Peter
Morrison
was
clearly
impatient
at
even
having
to
discuss
all
this
since
he
believed
that
such
an
outcome
was
beyond
the
bounds
of
possibility
It
was
then
agreed
that
the
form
of
words
to
be
used
by
Margaret
would
be
I
am
pleased
that
more
than
half
the
Parliamentary
Party
voted
for
me
and
I
would
like
to
thank
all
my
supporters
Nevertheless
I
am
disappointed
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
second
ballot
According
to
the
rules
laid
down
by
the
Committee
nominations
are
now
open
for
the
next
round
I
can
confirm
that
it
is
my
intention
to
let
my
name
go
forward
to
the
second
ballot
All
that
I
had
secured
in
the
way
of
time
to
consult
was
the
insertion
of
Margaret's
intention
to
stand
We
then
briefly
discussed
what
would
happen
in
the
event
of
a
defeat
but
one
which
still
required
a
further
round
of
voting
without
the
Prime
Minister
This
was
uncharted
ground
and
a
brief
on
the
constitutional
consequences
had
been
prepared
The
Palace
was
keen
that
the
Prime
Minister
should
continue
until
a
successor
had
been
elected
During
the
course
of
Monday
I
spoke
to
John
Wakeham
Tim
Renton
and
briefly
to
Norman
Tebbit
about
the
need
to
find
a
stop
Heseltine
candidate
in
the
event
of
Margaret
being
fatally
wounded
Towards
the
end
of
the
previous
week
it
looked
as
if
Douglas
Hurd
was
the
front
runner
for
this
position
although
he
had
told
his
PPS
Tim
Yeo
the
MP
for
Suffolk
South
Don't
go
scurrying
around
the
House
on
my
behalf
But
Douglas
had
said
over
the
weekend
that
in
certain
circumstances
he
would
be
prepared
to
stand
for
the
leadership
but
not
against
her
However
the
weekend
press
had
questioned
Douglas's
capacity
to
campaign
effectively
against
Neil
Kinnock
in
a
General
Election
Norman
Tebbit
did
not
want
Hong
Kong
Hurd
and
preferred
John
Major
but
the
difficulty
was
that
John
was
too
young
untried
and
not
very
well
known
Norman
thought
that
if
he
stood
himself
he
would
only
get
between
twenty
and
forty
votes
For
myself
I
thought
that
Michael
Heseltine
after
a
leadership
election
which
divided
the
Party
would
not
beat
Kinnock
in
a
General
Election
and
that
the
only
one
who
could
be
counted
upon
to
do
that
was
Margaret
In
the
afternoon
I
went
to
see
Willie
Whitelaw
in
his
small
narrow
office
in
the
House
of
Lords
He
was
still
of
the
view
that
if
a
third
of
the
Party
voted
against
Margaret
that
is
to
say
MPs
then
she
would
have
to
go
Willie
was
very
concerned
about
Michael
Heseltine
He
wanted
Douglas
as
an
alternative
leader
but
he
is
happy
as
Foreign
Secretary
and
he
is
not
really
suited
for
a
ruthless
campaign
against
Kinnock
The
trouble
with
Douglas
was
the
same
with
me
in
He
doesn't
really
want
the
job
Willie
then
also
said
I
expect
John
Major
will
stand
Many
will
vote
for
him
thinking
that
he
is
on
the
right
wing
They'll
be
disappointed
and
soon
find
out
that
he
isn't
I
spoke
on
the
telephone
to
John
Major
who
was
recuperating
at
his
Huntingdon
home
after
the
operation
on
his
wisdom
teeth
and
said
We
really
miss
you
from
the
campaign
It's
touch
and
go
I
had
also
heard
that
Norman
Lamont
and
Robert
Atkins
over
the
weekend
had
been
promoting
John
as
a
candidate
in
the
event
of
Margaret's
defeat
So
many
people
are
talking
up
your
chances
that
I
assume
there
is
some
campaign
running
on
your
behalf
I
said
John
vehemently
denied
this
and
said
he
had
been
discouraging
his
friends
from
promoting
his
name
as
a
candidate
Later
that
night
I
went
to
see
Peter
Morrison
who
said
that
his
latest
canvassing
returns
showed
that
the
Prime
Minister
could
get
as
many
as
votes
but
probably
would
receive
after
allowing
for
the
fib
factor
Michael
Heseltine
would
get
l00
if
he
was
lucky
I
took
a
bet
with
Peter
that
Michael
Heseltine
would
be
nearer
to
than
l00
in
the
hope
that
Peter
would
see
that
there
was
still
work
to
be
done
Tuesday
November
Election
Day
Margaret's
campaign
team
reconvened
on
the
Tuesday
morning
at
a.m
and
confirmed
the
line
which
the
Prime
Minister
had
by
then
agreed
I
again
urged
more
flexibility
as
I
had
learnt
that
some
Ministers
who
would
vote
for
her
in
the
first
ballot
might
not
vote
for
her
in
the
second
My
view
was
still
that
she
should
come
back
to
the
UK
and
consult
her
colleagues
about
going
on
as
a
decision
made
in
Paris
would
be
seen
as
high-handed
Norman
Tebbit
was
very
opposed
to
this
saying
that
if
she
didn't
straightaway
declare
she
was
going
on
then
support
would
immediately
haemorrhage
I
said
What
can
we
do
about
Ken
Clarke
Chris
Patten
and
Douglas
Hurd
as
I
anticipated
their
hostile
reaction
to
this
line
John
Wakeham
optimistically
said
If
she
makes
that
statement
they
will
have
to
back
it
The
atmosphere
in
the
House
prior
to
the
voting
was
quite
calm
Packs
of
journalists
stood
outside
Committee
Room
as
did
some
members
of
the
Labour
Party
like
Dennis
Skinner
sneering
and
sniping
At
p.m
John
Wakeham
Norman
Tebbit
Gerry
Neale
Michael
Neubert
Tim
Bell
Gordon
Reece
John
Whittingdale
David
Waddington
John
Moore
Mark
Lennox
Boyd
Tony
Newton
Alistair
McAlpine
Brendan
Bruce
Tony
Kerpel
and
I
gathered
in
the
Prime
Minister's
room
in
the
House
of
Commons
The
general
air
was
still
a
confident
one
At
p.m
Ian
Twinn
the
MP
for
Edmonton
came
down
and
gave
us
the
figures
It
was
bad
news
for
Margaret
for
Michael
Heseltine
and
sixteen
abstentions
The
Prime
Minister
had
a
majority
of
fifty-two
just
four
votes
short
of
the
fifty-six
majority
that
she
needed
If
two
Conservative
MPs
had
voted
the
other
way
she
would
have
been
safe
Tim
Renton
telephoned
the
news
to
Peter
Morrison
in
Paris
After
briefly
digesting
the
figures
Margaret
came
straight
out
on
to
the
steps
of
the
British
Embassy
and
rapidly
descending
them
asked
where
the
pool
microphone
was
The
BBC's
intrepid
political
reporter
John
Sargeant
who
had
been
addressing
the
camera
and
had
his
back
to
Margaret
was
alerted
to
her
arrival
and
achieved
his
place
in
history
by
spinning
round
defying
Bernard
Ingham
and
thrusting
the
BBC's
microphone
into
her
face
crying
out
Here's
the
microphone
Prime
Minister
Margaret
then
made
her
prepared
statement
saying
I
am
naturally
very
pleased
that
I
got
more
than
half
the
Parliamentary
Party
and
disappointed
that's
not
quite
enough
to
win
on
the
first
ballot
So
I
confirm
it
is
my
intention
to
let
my
name
go
forward
for
the
second
ballot
As
I
had
predicted
this
was
a
mistake
The
comments
back
at
Westminster
that
evening
were
that
the
Prime
Minister
had
reached
this
decision
all
alone
it
was
typical
of
her
style
and
far
too
gung-ho
The
speed
and
brusqueness
of
the
announcement
represented
all
that
her
critics
found
wrong
with
her
style
I
left
the
House
to
appear
on
the
TV
news
programmes
where
I
stressed
that
Margaret
had
got
per
cent
of
the
vote
and
that
under
any
other
system
this
would
have
led
to
a
clear
victory
With
a
majority
of
fifty-two
winners
do
not
throw
in
the
towel
I
also
said
that
the
Cabinet
was
united
behind
Margaret
This
proved
to
be
a
rather
rash
statement
Margaret
phoned
me
from
Paris
to
thank
me
for
my
efforts
and
I
said
to
her
You
must
get
back
to
London
Can
you
be
here
tonight
But
she
said
she
had
to
attend
an
official
dinner
and
a
musical
entertainment

Ridley
a
cleaning-up
operation
in
St
James's
Park
in
which
she
thrust
a
pointy
stick
in
the
direction
of
rubbish
that
had
been
carefully
strewn
in
her
path
It
could
have
been
a
sketch
from
Monty
Python
Her
eyes
according
to
Alan
Watkins
of
the
Observer
took
on
a
manic
quality
when
talking
about
Europe
while
her
teeth
were
such
as
to
gobble
you
up
More
sinister
still
she
slipped
into
the
habit
of
using
the
royal
we
in
public
We
are
a
grandmother
This
she
explained
in
the
Express
and
on
Panorama
as
follows
A
leader
must
lead
must
lead
firmly
have
convictions
and
see
that
those
convictions
are
reflected
in
every
piece
of
policy
How
can
I
change
Mrs
Thatcher
I
am
what
I
am
I
am
not
an
I
person
I
am
not
an
I
did
this
in
my
government
I
did
that
I
have
never
been
an
I
person
so
I
talk
about
We
the
government
I
cannot
do
things
alone
so
it
has
to
be
we
It
is
a
cabinet
we
Yes
I
do
lead
from
the
front
Yes
I
do
have
fundamental
convictions
but
we
do
have
very
lively
discussions
because
that
is
the
way
I
operate
Then
we
reach
collective
decisions
That's
collective
responsibility
The
events
of
October
and
November
have
been
recounted
in
a
score
of
books
most
of
which
I
have
reviewed
for
one
newspaper
or
another
The
best
is
probably
Alan
Watkins
A
Conservative
Coup
In
brief
there
was
no
plot
by
the
cabinet
to
get
rid
of
Margaret
there
was
some
plotting
on
her
behalf
but
in
the
main
events
moved
inexorably
once
Geoffrey
Howe
made
his
famous
resignation
speech
in
the
Commons
on
Tuesday
November
Once
Geoffrey
had
spoken
she
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
dead
in
the
water
I
watched
the
proceedings
from
the
upstairs
MPs
gallery
looking
directly
down
on
to
the
government
benches
The
House
was
packed
the
silence
broken
only
by
the
occasional
oohs
and
aahs
from
the
Labour
benches
as
the
enormity
of
Howe's
attack
dawned
slowly
upon
them
As
for
the
Tories
they
listened
silently
without
facial
expression
of
any
kind
It
was
clear
from
the
moment
that
Geoffrey
began
his
speech
that
this
was
no
tour
d'horizon
no
graceful
recollection
of
time
well
spent
in
office
it
was
a
carefully
crafted
smoothly
delivered
destructively
pointed
attack
on
the
Prime
Minister's
actions
and
attitudes
It
ended
with
what
amounted
to
an
invitation
to
Michael
Heseltine
to
mount
a
direct
challenge
to
her
leadership
As
a
performance
it
was
on
a
par
with
Nigel
Birch's
never
glad
confident
morning
again
speech
of
when
he
took
his
revenge
upon
Harold
Macmillan
It
was
as
Lady
Thatcher
was
later
wryly
to
observe
quite
the
best
speech
she
had
ever
heard
Geoffrey
make
At
the
time
she
sat
grim-faced
looking
neither
left
nor
right
When
Geoffrey
finished
she
left
the
Chamber
I
hurried
down
into
the
Members
Lobby
where
I
caught
sight
of
Elspeth
Howe
running
in
the
direction
of
Geoffrey's
room
Charles
Irving
the
Tory
MP
for
Cheltenham
claimed
that
it
had
taken
Elspeth
ten
minutes
to
write
the
speech
Geoffrey
ten
years
to
make
it
It
was
a
good
crack
but
inaccurate
Geoffrey
had
written
every
word
of
it
The
lobby
was
crowded
with
MPs
and
lobby
correspondents
in
a
state
of
high
excitement
Now
Michael
must
run
and
she's
dead
in
the
water
were
the
two
views
generally
expressed
Several
days
previously
I
had
counselled
caution
Michael
was
doing
a
trawl
of
those
who
were
committed
to
him
Now
unless
he
wanted
his
bluff
to
be
called
in
the
most
humiliating
way
he
had
no
choice
His
friends
sought
him
out
in
the
tea-room
and
the
lobbies
to
tell
him
so
A
day
or
so
later
I
was
lunching
in
the
Members
Dining
Room
Geoffrey
came
and
sat
opposite
me
with
Robin
Maxwell-Hyslop
on
his
right
hand
Geoffrey
and
I
talked
of
old
times
in
the
Bow
Group
of
my
visit
at
his
invitation
to
Chevening
the
great
house
in
Kent
which
he
was
obliged
to
give
up
on
losing
the
Foreign
and
Commonwealth
Office
We
chatted
about
everything
but
his
recent
speech
Maxwell-Hyslop
who
had
turned
his
back
on
him
shouted
some
generalised
abuse
in
Geoffrey's
direction
Howe
took
no
notice
as
he
stalked
out
It
was
the
only
time
in
thirty
years
of
eating
in
the
Commons
that
I
have
witnessed
such
offensive
behaviour
it
was
a
sign
of
just
how
high
feelings
were
running
Poor
Geoffrey
had
just
been
unlucky
in
his
seating
for
Robin
Maxwell-Hyslop
had
always
been
a
man
to
avoid
In
the
days
that
followed
I
spent
the
bulk
of
my
campaigning
either
on
the
box
or
writing
articles
in
favour
of
Michael's
candidature
in
the
press
No
one
bothered
to
canvass
me
my
colours
having
been
nailed
to
Heseltine's
mast
since
our
Pembroke
days
This
was
in
a
sense
a
pity
for
much
of
the
fun
lay
in
the
importunings
of
the
colleagues
who
paper
and
pencil
in
hand
would
sidle
up
to
people
with
whom
they
barely
passed
the
time
of
day
in
normal
circumstances
to
learn
for
whom
they
were
thinking
of
voting
I
could
have
been
lunched
by
Peter
Morrison
or
dined
by
Tristan
Garel-Jones
but
no
such
luck
in
the
event
I
was
not
required
to
try
to
convert
anyone
Colonel
Mates
the
Black
Uhlan
who
was
Michael's
chief
of
staff
probably
considered
such
an
act
likely
to
be
counter-productive
but
to
sing
our
candidate's
praise
on
TV
and
in
print
No
jokes
warned
the
massive
figure
of
Sir
Peter
Tapsell
another
of
Michael's
inner
circle
Michael
has
many
achievements
to
his
credit
I
promised
not
to
make
any
jokes
Michael's
election
campaign
coincided
with
the
Hartley
Wintney
Christmas
Fair
which
I
duly
attended
I
was
soon
surrounded
by
a
squad
of
retired
colonels
majors
and
captains
who
asked
me
for
whom
I
would
be
voting
I
suspected
their
loyalties
lay
with
Margaret
but
I
spotted
at
the
back
of
the
throng
the
mackintoshed
figure
of
Field
Marshal
Sir
John
Stanier
Sir
John
I
asked
for
whom
would
you
vote
Heseltine
of
course
was
his
reply
The
colonels
majors
and
captains
were
suitably
impressed
I
have
looked
at
my
freelance
journalism
account
book
for
November
and
found
recorded
eighty-four
different
sources
of
income
ranging
from
an
Observer
profile
of
Michael
to
Breakfast
with
Frost
to
Newsnight
Panorama
and
umpteen
foreign
television
stations
the
London
offices
of
which
were
desperate
to
interview
Michael
Heseltine's
old
school-chum
Usually
my
monthly
total
of
commissions
was
about
twenty
I
stressed
his
stamina
his
integrity
and
his
ministerial
experience
I
claimed
that
Margaret
had
outstayed
her
welcome
and
that
under
her
leadership
defeat
stared
the
party
in
the
face
Later
after
she
withdrew
I
claimed
that
Michael
was
by
far
the
biggest
of
the
three
candidates
I
am
certain
I
did
not
convert
any
colleague
who
might
have
been
watching
the
box
but
Michael
did
remain
the
public's
favourite
throughout
both
elections
At
about
half
past
five
on
the
evening
of
Tuesday
November
I
went
upstairs
to
the
Committee
Corridor
to
await
the
result
of
the
first
ballot
By
six
when
the
poll
closed
the
wide
corridor
had
become
densely
packed
with
MPs
of
all
parties
I
caught
sight
of
Dennis
Skinner
and
of
Tony
Benn
and
a
collection
of
native
and
foreign
journalists
the
bulk
of
whom
were
strangers
to
me
The
excitement
was
intense
and
the
heat
oppressive
Suddenly
there
was
silence
and
someone
could
be
heard
in
the
distance
reading
out
the
result
Margaret
Thatcher
Michael
Heseltine
abstentions
The
cry
then
went
up
second
ballot
Margaret
had
failed
by
four
votes
to
win
outright
There
was
chaos
in
several
of
the
committee
rooms
which
were
packed
with
Tory
MPs
enraged
that
the
press
had
been
the
first
to
know
It
appeared
that
Cranley
Onslow
the
admirable
chairman
of
the
had
read
out
the
results
in
the
wrong
committee
room
It
was
an
error
that
was
eventually
to
cost
him
the
chairmanship
of
the
Committee
The
cry
went
up
My
God
she's
finished
The
crowd
then
faded
away
the
hacks
to
their
telephones
the
Heselteenies
to
the
Smoking
Room
to
celebrate
Pol
Roger
the
Thatcherites
to
cabal
in
a
state
of
gloomy
stupefaction
Mrs
Thatcher
was
clearly
finished
Tory
MPs
had
either
voted
for
Michael
or
abstained
No
Prime
Minister
could
survive
so
large
a
rejection
A
more
sinister
thought
was
that
if
Mrs
Thatcher
could
not
heal
so
wide
a
breach
could
Michael
It
was
this
double
rejection
that
sooner
or
later
came
to
occupy
the
minds
of
Tory
MPs
We
rushed
to
find
a
television
set
to
see
how
Mrs
Thatcher
would
react
to
the
news
of
her
defeat
Foolishly
and
for
no
good
reason
she
had
gone
to
Paris
for
a
summit
The
bearer
of
the
ill-tidings
was
her
newly
appointed
PPS
Sir
Peter
Morrison
No
one
watching
that
evening
will
forget
her
dramatic
appearance
in
the
courtyard
of
the
embassy
as
she
elbowed
her
way
past
Bernard
Ingham
to
proclaim
to
the
world
that
she
would
fight
on
C'est
magifique
murmured
Ian
Gilmour
mais
I
remember
someone
saying
in
the
Smoking
Room
on
hearing
that
she
had
appointed
Peter
Morrison
as
her
PPS
she's
in
the
bunker
now
Peter
was
the
Thatcherite
brother
of
the
wet
Charlie
Morrison
and
son
of
the
John
Morrison
who
had
been
the
chairman
of
the
when
I
was
first
elected
in
He
seemed
an
unsuitable
candidate
for
a
very
difficult
job
He
was
both
grand
and
unapproachable
He
was
to
play
the
role
of
General
Wenck
whose
imaginary
th
Army
was
to
relieve
beleaguered
Berlin
in
Mrs
Thatcher's
supporters
and
especially
her
Court
have
found
it
hard
to
come
to
terms
with
her
resignation
In
a
search
for
scapegoats
they
have
blamed
Tristan
Garel-Jones
her
cabinet
colleagues
and
occasionally
themselves
for
not
working
hard
enough
on
her
behalf
But
they
all
miss
the
point
After
the
first
ballot
the
more
far-sighted
believed
that
Margaret
was
finished
the
fact
that
the
margin
of
four
votes
was
so
narrow
was
neither
here
nor
there
Even
had
it
been
possible
to
rustle
up
or
to
convert
another
four
Tory
MPs
it
would
have
made
no
practical
difference
to
her
position
She
had
been
holed
below
the
waterline
There
is
no
doubt
that
a
majority
of
her
cabinet
colleagues
were
glad
to
see
the
back
of
her
but
they
gave
their
advice
freely
and
frankly
note
desc="summary
of
multiple
speech
events
see
as
reporting
verb
As
they
saw
it
she
was
unlikely
to
defeat
Michael
in
a
second
ballot
And
were
Michael
to
win
not
only
would
he
recast
the
cabinet
but
he
would
also
find
himself
faced
by
a
phalanx
of
irreconcilables
who
would
strive
to
make
his
position
as
Prime
Minister
untenable
Hence
the
emergence
almost
at
the
eleventh
hour
of
the
unknown
John
Major
who
had
offended
no
one
and
about
whose
political
beliefs
nobody
could
be
certain
The
Thatcherites
listened
to
their
lost
leader
and
voted
for
dear
John
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
his
political
hero
was
Iain
Macleod
Whatever
John
Major's
strengths
and
weaknesses
he
did
provide
the
cement
without
which
the
Tory
party
would
not
have
won
the
general
election
I
stuck
with
Michael
to
the
end
It
soon
appeared
inevitable
that
he
would
lose
but
it
was
a
brave
try
And
writing
four
years
after
the
event
who
is
to
say
that
he
might
not
have
done
better
than
John
Major
He
had
come
a
long
way
from
that
evening
in
Long
John's
restaurant
in
Oxford
in
when
he
put
Downing
Street
next
to
the
s
when
he
charted
his
future
course

Not
long
ago
we
had
been
to
an
anti-war
exhibition
horrifying
photographs
of
mutilation
death
destruction
in
the
Great
War
It
had
been
mounted
by
the
party
in
the
interests
of
the
current
Comintern
strategy
active
in
the
disarmament
and
anti-war
movement
to
project
its
desired
image
as
the
only
genuine
worker
for
peace
One
photograph
imprinted
itself
especially
on
my
mind
a
huge
enlargement
in
grainy
black
and
white
more
than
six
feet
high
of
a
man's
face
with
one
side
blown
off
by
a
shell
In
place
of
half
his
mouth
and
one
cheek
was
a
yawning
cave
of
flesh
kept
open
with
metal
struts
so
that
food
and
breath
could
pass
There
were
others
Disturbing
in
a
different
fashion
was
a
section
devoted
to
the
arms
industry
telling
of
a
factory
on
the
border
between
France
and
Germany
that
during
the
Great
War
had
supplied
munitions
to
both
sides
Bernard
snorted
That
only
happens
in
a
capitalist
war!
Spain
is
a
working-class
war
The
first
one!
We
would
soon
learn
that
worse
things
were
happening
in
the
Spanish
War
The
tidal
wave
of
anti-war
and
disarmament
movements
the
first
of
our
time
displayed
an
innocence
now
hard
to
understand
until
we
think
of
the
Flower
Children
of
the
Sixties
an
appeal
to
the
softer
side
of
human
nature
faith
in
the
power
of
gentleness
and
the
will
to
peace
If
only
people
and
nations
would
let
themselves
be
swayed
by
kindness!
If
only
they
the
people
who
fear
us
and
insist
on
arming
against
us
would
believe
we
are
innocent
and
that
we
only
wish
for
good
to
prevail
and
not
attack
us
first!
One
was
the
Peace
Pledge
Union
its
name
a
naive
throwback
to
the
campaign
in
the
early
years
of
the
century
for
signing
the
pledge
against
the
demon
drink
instinct
with
the
belief
that
if
you
but
had
the
will
everything
was
possible
So
the
will
to
peace
the
mind
suppressing
the
brutish
passions
was
all
that
was
needed
to
outlaw
war
Many
peace
propagandists
declared
and
some
still
do
that
for
a
nation
to
be
armed
at
all
was
to
provoke
aggression
If
only
one
nation
would
disarm
it
would
exert
an
irresistible
moral
pressure
on
all
the
others
to
do
the
same
Many
of
the
disarmament
and
peace
groups
were
party
front
organisations
in
others
party
underground
members
formed
cells
and
by
their
dynamism
and
through
constitutional
manoeuvres
moved
into
positions
of
control
The
party
steered
money
into
them
and
boosted
their
efforts
with
opportunist
propaganda
In
these
ways
it
created
a
Fifth
Column
to
fulfil
Russia's
designs
one
of
which
was
the
military
weakness
of
its
host
country
In
spite
of
our
inexperience
or
perhaps
because
of
it
our
sympathy
made
us
feel
the
trauma
of
the
Great
War
survivors
as
our
own
so
that
the
peace
movements
plea
spoke
to
us
powerfully
It
joined
together
two
fears
that
the
Western
powers
war
plans
would
steer
us
into
mass
slaughter
again
and
another
lost
generation
and
that
in
the
process
a
ray
of
hope
for
a
humaner
society
the
image
of
Russia
that
so
many
people
wanted
to
believe
in
would
be
extinguished
War
plans
How
could
we
know
that
Britain
and
France
were
militarily
at
their
weakest
for
twenty
years!
Party
branches
were
ordered
to
monitor
the
movements
of
trains
and
ships
carrying
munitions
and
chemicals
and
military
units
and
send
the
information
to
King
Street
whence
of
course
it
went
to
Moscow
Some
of
it
one
must
assume
from
later
events
was
filtered
by
Moscow
onwards
to
German
Intelligence
Groping
for
some

a

trying
to

Bernard
out
of
his
stonewalling
something
made
me
say
All

talk
about

will
the

more
than
fifteen
shillings
a
week
when
I
get
back
Better
still
will
the
union
fight
to
get
me
a
decent
job
all
the
year
round
I
was
ashamed
the
moment
I
had
spoken
It
was
a
silly
way
of
expressing
futility
His
forbearance
snapped
Angrily
he
halted
tugged
at
my
sleeve
to
stop
me
in
my
tracks
and
pointed
past
me
at
something
Just
you
look
at
that!
He
was
hoarse
with
fury
For
Christ's
sake
stop
bellyaching
and
take
first
things
first!
Do
you
want
to
live
like
that
all
your
life
you
and
everybody
else
round
here
Do
you!
Look
man!
Look!
I
turned
to
see
what
he
was
pointing
at
We
were
at
the
mouth
of
a
close
the
narrow
slit
in
a
tenement
facade
entered
directly
from
the
street
giving
on
to
a
stone-paved
corridor
barely
wide
enough
for
two
people
abreast
about
five
yards
long
leading
to
stone
stairs
up
to
flats
on
three
storeys
above
At
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
corridor
angled
itself
sharply
past
them
and
continued
narrower
still
in
darkness
untouched
by
the
feeble
yellow
light
of
the
gas
mantle
projecting
from
a
slender
pipe
on
the
wall
above
the
stairfoot
to
a
lime
unpaved
back
yard
with
its
ash-pits
rubbish
dumps
and
posts
for
clothes
lines
I
took
a
few
steps
into
the
close
and
he
followed
At
first
glance
it
could
have
been
any
one
of
hundreds
in
the
Gorbals
sights
and
smells
so
familiar
that
I
had
long
ago
ceased
to
be
aware
of
them
Looked
at
carefully
as
we
stood
between
the
nudging
walls
in
the
dim
light
this
one
was
worse
than
most
the
one
where
I
lived
in
Warwick
Street
for
instance
but
it
required
an
effort
to
remember
and
compare
Nearly
all
the
stone
steps
in
the
first
flight
up
to
the
half-landing
were
broken
with
jagged
edges
where
bits
of
tread
had
fallen
away
Some
had
almost
no
tread
left
Plaster
had
come
away
from
the
walls
from
ceiling
to
floor
and
along
the
lower
part
the
bared
cement
originally
grey
was
stained
yellow
and
smelt
of
urine
On
a
patch
where
the
rough
surface
of
brickwork
was
exposed
someone
had
vomited
probably
a
passing
drunk
whose
sense
of
propriety
demanding
privacy
had
deterred
him
from
being
sick
in
the
street
or
a
returning
resident
who
could
not
wait
to
climb
the
few
steps
to
the
communal
toilet
on
the
first
half-landing
The
detritus
had
stuck
to
the
pitted
surface
in
a
wide
streaky
band
as
it
slid
lumpily
from
chest
height
to
the
floor
Judging
by
the
strength
of
its
smell
a
mixture
of
beer
and
fish
and
chips
the
vomit
was
recent
Another
powerful
smell
of
decaying
rubbish
came
mainly
from
the
ash-pits
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
but
also
from
a
deposit
scattered
over
the
floor
Despite
the
cold
wet
wind
blowing
in
hard
from
the
street
the
cloud
of
mephitic
vapours
lingered
stupefyingly
about
our
heads
No
one
could
afford
to
throw
away
food
leavings
that
had
any
good
left
in
them
They
used
up
what
they
could
in
broths
and
soups
and
pies
But
a
final
residue
potato
peelings
fish
heads
or
meat
bones
from
which
repeated
boiling
had
extracted
all
nourishment
or
food
that
had
gone
off
refrigerators
were
for
the
rich
was
thrown
on
the
ash-pits
whence
it
was
scavenged
by
rats
and
stray
cats
At
dead
of
night
sometimes
even
in
daytime
one
heard
their
furious
scrabblings
there
resulting
in
a
scatter
of
rubbish
all
over
the
close
so
that
one
picked
one's
way
among
little
heaps
so
far
gone
in
putrefaction
as
to
be
rejected
by
even
these
ravening
beasts
Here
at
our
feet
great
holes
among
the
broken
flagstones
overflowed
with
such
rotting
material
foul
bits
of
paper
excrement
mud
broken
glass
I
realised
I
was
looking
at
a
close
really
looking
for
the
first
time
Perhaps
the
sickly
yellow
gloom
all
the
light
the
tiny
gas
mantle
produced
worsened
the
impact
A
revulsion
hit
me
like
a
heavy
punch
to
the
head
In
the
fleeting
dizziness
I
had
a
nightmare
vision
I
stood
among
gigantic
glistening
boils
that
had
burst
and
the
pus
spattered
on
me
and
oozed
down
like
the
vomit
on
the
wall
in
a
foul
stream
to
the
floor
How
could
I
not
have
seen
all
this
before
surrounding
me
as
it
did
everywhere
I
went
Of
course
I
had
seen
it
I
had
shut
it
out
tolerated
it
accepted
it
as
the
given
We
all
had
Except
Phil
and
his
like
Traitors
to
their
class!
Yes
it
could
be
any
close
Bernard
stood
at
my
side
silently
insisting
on
an
answer
It
was
now
his
turn
to
blow
the
flame
of
inner
crisis
within
me
as
I
had
done
to
him
He
wanted
me
to
come
away
from
the
sidelines
stop
my
inner
war
of
uncertain
aims
resentments
and
thwarted
will
and
harness
the
wasted
energy
at
last
And
become
presumably
as
committed
as
he
Why
should
I
be
so
disturbed
What
external
spark
had
I
been
awaiting
I
knew
only
one
thing
for
certain
Not
only
Bernard
would
shift
I
would
too
How
and
in
what
direction
I
had
no
idea
In
provoking
him
I
had
sapped
at
my
own
position
too
Nothing
made
any
sense
though
what
did
sense
mean
I
told
myself
that
my
dismay
and
sadness
and
self-accusation
were
simply
the
shock
of
looking
upon
these
lower
depths
and
seeing
them
truly
at
last
that
I
recoiled
not
from
these
visible
truths
alone
but
from
all
the
questions
in
life
they
stood
for
and
from
what
its
recognition
would
demand
of
me
I
had
tried
amazingly
to
forget
that
I
myself
was
part
of
this
horror
And
yet
I
made
excuses
This
was
only
part
of
life
after
all
You
didn't
look
at
life
layer
by
layer
like
Peer
Gynt
with
the
onion
You
looked
at
the
whole
At
relationships
as
they
were
and
as
they
could
be
Yes
that
was
the
heart
of
the
matter
How
could
you
make
sense
out
of
fine
gradations
between
one
face
of
suffering
and
another
I
heard
myself
say
and
wondered
afterwards
at
how
inadequate
the
words
were
It
could
do
with
a
bit
of
titivating
couldn't
it
like
a
lot
of
other
things
A
bit!
he
shouted
My
God!
Are
you
blind!
Look
at
the
shite
flowing
out
of
that
lavatory
and
that
broken
tap
up
there
with
all
the
water
pouring
away
and
taking
the
shite
down
the
stairs
with
it
This
close
like
a
great
many
others
had
a
shared
water
tap
as
well
as
a
shared
lavatory
on
a
little
half-landing
at
the
turn
of
the
stairs
between
floors
and
the
ash-pits
stinking
out
the
whole
street!
And
the
shite
and
the
piss
and
the
vomit
and
God
knows
what
else!
We're
standing
in
it!
And
how
do
you
like
this
No
wonder
there's
disease
everywhere!
He
pointed
down
to
fresh
rat
droppings
on
the
flagstones
A
shout
startled
us
It
came
from
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
at
the
opening
to
the
back
yard
in
the
dark
angle
of
wall
beneath
the
stairs
that
the
weak
gas
light
could
not
reach
Aw
fuck
aff
an
gie
us
a
hi
o
peace
wull
ye!
a
young
man's
voice
breathless
grumpy
There
was
a
rustling
sound
in
the
darkness
and
a
girl's
loud
whisper
Wheesht
dear
wheesht!
The
man
growled
Aw
hen
ah
hadnae
time
tee
ge'intae
ye!
The
girl
giggled
and
whispered
audibly
again
Maybe
that's
just
as
well
dear!
Ah
tells
ye
ah
never
minded
when
the
happened!
Bu
ah
do
came
the
furious
reply
In
her
throaty
whisper
she
said
soothingly
Anyway
dear
ah'll
ge
ma
monthlies
all
right
this
way
won't
ah
The
man
grunted
non-commitally
Her
thoughts
of
pregnancy
calculation
or
fear
were
evidently
of
no
interest
to
him
Wait
now
he
muttered
Ah'll
be
ready
again
soon
enough
More
whisperings
now
subdued
The
natural
vigour
in
the
venial
sin
Is
the
way
in
which
our
lives
begin
Oh
Venus
of
the
ash-pits!
How
many
virgins
have
you
bled
here
How
many
seeds
of
life
implanted

Master
lie
with
me
specially
at
such
times
Help
me
to
remember
you
constantly
and
let
me
feel
your
presence
You
aren't
shocked
by
the
camping
of
the
publicans
and
the
screaming
of
the
sinners
You
didn't
condemn
you
danced
with
the
drunkards
This
was
written
after
a
party
which
my
diary
describes
as
a
massacre
It
had
left
me
with
an
unusually
bad
hangover
and
no
doubt
a
sinkful
of
dishwashing
to
be
done
Such
a
situation
was
apt
to
arouse
my
puritan
resentment
against
the
life
I
was
allowing
myself
to
lead
Only
this
time
it
seems
that
my
reaction
was
more
positive
If
we
had
to
have
such
parties
why
not
mentally
invite
Ramakrishna
to
join
us
He
couldn't
refuse
Ramakrishna
had
been
known
to
get
out
of
a
carriage
to
dance
with
drunkards
on
the
street
The
sight
of
their
reeling
inspired
him
because
it
made
him
think
of
the
way
a
holy
man
reels
in
ecstasy
He
danced
with
his
friend
G
C
Ghosh
a
famous
dramatist
and
actor
when
Ghosh
was
drunk
and
encouraged
him
to
go
on
drinking
Ghosh
took
advantage
of
Ramakrishna's
permissiveness
and
visited
him
at
all
hours
of
the
night
sometimes
on
the
way
home
from
a
whorehouse
Ghosh
became
a
kind
of
patron
saint
for
me
I
felt
closer
to
him
than
to
any
other
member
of
Ramakrishna's
circle
but
I
wasn't
worthy
to
be
his
disciple
I
failed
to
go
the
whole
hog
as
he
had
either
in
debauchery
or
devotion
Ghosh
dared
to
reveal
himself
shamelessly
to
Ramakrishna
thereby
making
a
sacrifice
of
his
own
self-esteem
and
self-will
and
submitting
totally
to
Ramakrishna's
guidance
That
was
his
greatness
I
am
sorry
now
that
throughout
any
long
relationship
with
Swami
I
never
once
came
into
his
presence
drunk
Something
wonderful
might
have
happened
On
March
I
went
up
to
the
Center
to
take
part
in
Ramakrishna's
birthday
puja
Webster
was
there
He
had
left
the
Center
not
long
after
I
had
I
think
he
was
already
married
or
engaged
to
be
At
first
he
was
a
little
awkward
and
on
the
defensive
with
me
Then
we
settled
down
into
the
mood
of
old
alumni
and
joked
about
the
new
building
schemes
the
temple
is
to
have
enlarged
wings
The
old
place
certainly
has
changed
Nearly
all
the
girls
are
now
up
at
Montecito
and
there
are
several
new
monks
here
George
took
flash-bulb
photos
throughout
the
puja
This
bothered
some
people
but
it's
his
privilege
granted
by
Swami
They
have
recently
bought
another
house
the
one
that
stands
behind
There
is
a
room
in
it
which
Swami
says
is
for
me
It
rather
scares
me
the
way
he
waits
Shall
I
ever
find
myself
back
there
It
seems
impossible
and
yet
While
Swami
was
in
Arizona
the
other
day
as
the
guest
of
some
devotees
he
was
taken
to
Taliesin
West
where
he
met
Frank
Lloyd
Wright
Swami
who
had
never
heard
of
Wright
and
whose
previous
ideas
of
architecture
were
limited
to
domes
and
lots
of
gold
was
greatly
impressed
Mr
Wright
he
said
you
are
not
an
architect
you
are
a
philosopher
And
he
added
that
at
Taliesin
you
felt
yourself
not
in
a
house
but
protected
by
Nature
I
couldn't
help
laughing
when
Swami
told
me
this
because
the
cunningest
flatterer
couldn't
have
buttered
Wright
up
more
completely
than
Swami
had
in
his
utter
artlessness
Needless
to
say
Wright
was
enchanted
July
Today
I
went
to
the
Center
to
attend
Sister's
funeral
or
rather
the
part
of
it
which
took
place
in
the
temple
I
think
her
family
organized
another
ceremony
elsewhere
Sister
died
last
week
in
Montecito
I
saw
her
there
on
the
th
I
drove
up
for
lunch
She
had
had
pneumonia
then
and
an
attack
of
uremia
but
she
seemed
better
that
day
The
dark
plum-colored
rash
which
had
broken
out
in
several
places
on
her
body
was
clearing
She
apologised
for
it
with
her
usual
courtesy
She
didn't
want
me
to
touch
her
hand
which
was
smeared
with
salve
She
had
known
me
as
soon
as
I
came
into
the
room
It's
so
nice
to
see
old
friends
she
said
After
a
few
minutes
she
drowsed
off
Amiya
and
Swami
told
me
that
much
of
the
time
she
thought
she
was
back
in
Honolulu
where
she
lived
during
her
youth
Swami
also
told
me
that
she
had
had
difficulty
in
urinating
but
was
able
to
do
so
after
he'd
given
her
a
drop
of
Ganges
water
How
this
would
horrify
some
people
I
know!
I
came
away
with
a
feeling
that
she
was
going
to
recover
this
time
Today
was
a
hot
morning
I
arrived
at
the
temple
in
a
bad
mood
having
been
horrible
and
unkind
to
Caskey
before
I
left
the
house
Some
people
arrived
with
flowers
which
I
hate
at
funerals
and
never
bring
if
I
can
avoid
it
There
were
women
in
various
degrees
of
elegant
mourning
Swami
sat
on
the
sofa
in
the
living
room
You
couldn't
exactly
say
his
face
looked
tragic
but
the
brightness
had
left
it
and
it
was
almost
frighteningly
austere
He
took
my
arm
and
led
me
into
his
bedroom
where
he
told
me
about
Sister's
death
Just
before
it
happened
Swami
found
himself
in
a
high
spiritual
mood
and
then
they
called
him
into
her
room
and
at
that
moment
the
breath
left
her
body
with
a
faint
puff
through
the
lips
She
was
a
saint
Swami
said
He
believes
that
she
passed
into
samadhi
at
the
end
He
said
how
recently
she
had
told
him
that
she
never
left
the
shrine
until
she
had
seen
light
She
thought
this
quite
normal
and
supposed
that
everybody
saw
it
In
fact
she
was
apologizing
to
Swami
because
in
her
case
it
often
took
quite
a
long
time
and
made
her
late
for
meals
and
kept
people
waiting
Came
away
in
a
calm
happy
open
mood
and
felt
a
real
horror
of
my
unkindness
to
Caskey
and
of
any
unkindness
to
anyone
Thinking
of
Sister
I
remembered
how
I
asked
her
once
what
Vivekananda
had
been
like
She
answered
without
hesitation
Oh
he
was
like
a
great
cat
so
graceful
By
gradual
degrees
Gerald
Heard
had
become
disinclined
to
go
on
living
at
Trabuco
No
doubt
as
he
grew
older
he
was
now
sixty
he
felt
the
strain
of
being
the
central
figure
in
this
group
and
of
all
the
talk
and
letter
writing
and
planning
that
it
involved
This
year
he
came
to
a
decision
Trabuco
ought
to
belong
to
an
organization
which
could
make
more
effective
use
of
it
Gerald
easily
persuaded
his
fellow
trustees
to
agree
with
him
as
soon
as
he
had
made
it
clear
that
he
himself
was
determined
to
retire
And
so
Trabuco
which
had
never
been
the
property
of
an
individual
was
offered
to
another
non-individual
the
Vedanta
Society
It
so
happened
that
a
number
of
young
men
had
joined
the
Center
during
the
past
months
Swami
sent
several
of
them
to
live
at
Trabuco
It
was
officially
opened
as
a
Vedanta
monastery
on
September
In
October
Swami
left
for
India
with
George
and
three
of
the
nuns
They
returned
in
May
I
saw
Swami
fairly
often
after
his
return
but
I
have
no
record
of
our
meetings
My
diary
keeping
almost
stopped
that
year
because
of
misery
sloth
induced
by
the
Korean
War
and
the
gradual
breakdown
of
my
relationship
with
Caskey
We
were
both
aware
of
this
breakdown
but
wrongly
blamed
it
on
the
pressures
of
life
in
Los
Angeles
so
we
decided
to
move
down
to
Laguna
Beach
Once
settled
into
a
house
there
we
soon
began
to
jar
upon
each
other
again
My
few
diary
entries
of
are
mostly
self-scoldings
for
giving
way
to
feelings
of
helplessness
for
being
criminally
unhappy
for
trying
to
impose
my
will
on
Caskey
under
the
guise
of
reason
I
now
began
to
spend
more
and
more
time
away
from
him
staying
in
Los
Angeles
August
Today
I
had
lunch
with
Swami
who
is
at
Trabuco
He
urged
me
more
strongly
than
ever
before
to
come
back
and
live
with
them
He
said
It
must
happen
I've
wanted
it
and
prayed
for
it
so
much
I
answered
evasively
as
usual
Gerald
Heard
and
Chris
Wood
came
to
visit
him
later
and
I
returned
with
them
to
Laguna
and
had
tea
I
asked
Gerald
what
he
thought
I
should
do
about
Trabuco
He
said
that
I
should
obey
Swami
and
go
to
live
there
He
said
that
he
knew
Swami
was
deeply
disturbed
about
me
and
that
he
was
disturbed
himself
If
I
didn't
do
as
Swami
told
me
something
terrible
might
happen
to
me
I
asked
What
Gerald
said
that
I
might
lose
my
faith
entirely
and
cease
to
believe
that
God
exists
He
then
became
very
mysterious
saying
that
he
feared
I
was
being
followed
by
something
which
was
trying
to
possess
me
and
even
hinting
that
he
had
had
a
glimpse
of
it
I
asked
him
to
describe
what
it
looked
like
He
gazed
at
me
solemnly
for
a
moment
and
then
answered
sternly
No
I
was
largely
impressed
by
the
dramatic
power
with
which
Gerald
delivered
his
warning
but
I
simply
couldn't
take
it
seriously
I
felt
that
it
was
his
literary
self
speaking
especially
since
he
had
just
written
an
excellent
supernatural
thriller
in
which
a
man
performs
a
black-magical
ritual
to
destroy
his
enemy
and
consequently
gets
haunted
by
a
familiar
spirit
in
the
form
of
a
fox
The
Black
Fox
was
the
title
of
Gerald's
novel
It
wasn't
that
I
pooh-poohed
the
idea
that
one
could
be
possessed
by
a
familiar
I
had
a
wholesome
respect
for
the
dangers
of
dabbling
in
black
magic
and
would
never
have
done
so
under
any
circumstances
What
I
didn't
believe
was
that
one
could
fall
into
its
power
without
somehow
cooperating
My
recent
life
had
been
sex-absorbed
and
drunken
and
angry
but
certainly
not
devilish
I
was
sure
I
had
never
done
anything
to
deserve
the
attentions
of
a
black
fox
As
for
losing
my
faith
the
opposite
was
true
In
my
present
dilemma
it
was
actually
getting
stronger
Indeed
I
was
beginning
to
think
that
it
might
drag
me
back
to
the
Center
against
any
will
August
This
morning
on
a
sudden
impulse
I
drove
to
Trabuco
and
saw
Swami
and
talked
to
him
about
the
possibility
of
coming
to
live
up
there
or
in
Hollywood
I
was
careful
not
to
commit
myself
but
of
course
Swami
now
takes
it
for
granted
that
I'm
coming
He
said
that
Gerald
and
Aldous
had
come
to
him
and
told
him
things
about
the
way
I
am
living
and
asked
him
to
remonstrate
with
me
Swami
had
answered
Why
don't
you
pray
for
him
I
was
touched
and
delighted
by
Swami's
reaction
which
I
interpreted
as
a
rebuke
to
Gerald
and
Aldous
Wasn't
he
telling
them
in
effect
You'd
do
better
to
love
Chris
more
and
criticize
him
less
That
was
what
I
wanted
him
to
have
meant
It
did
annoy
me
that
the
two
of
them
had
spoken
to
Swami
behind
my
back
and
yet
what
else
could
I
have
expected
They
regarded
me
as
an
irresponsible
child
You
don't
interfere
with
the
doings
of
other
people's
children
you
go
to
the
parent
When
I
asked
Swami
what
it
was
that
they
had
told
him
he
said
vaguely
that
I'd
been
seen
in
some
bad
place
the
nature
of
the
place
didn't
seem
to
interest
him
It
could
only
have
been
a
homosexual
bar
But
who
could
have
seen
me
there
Obviously
neither
Gerald
nor
Aldous
in
person
No
doubt
it
was
some
miserable
demi-devotee
with
a
foot
in
both
worlds
just
like
myself
six
years
ago
He
must
have
feared
that
I'd
recognized
him
at
that
bar
and
relieved
his
own
guilt
by
reporting
me
and
my
improper
behavior
I
found
it
much
easier
to
forgive
Aldous
for
his
interference
than
Gerald
Aldous
didn't
know
any
better
he
was
essentially
a
square
Happily
my
resentment
against
Gerald
was
to
disappear
before
long
because
of
a
profound
change
he
made
in
his
own
outlook

For

of
the
s
while

I
was
commuting
to
London
by
air
for
three
nights
a
week
to
present
late-night
current
affairs
programmes
Hours
Midweek
Tonight

Of

I

I
remember
very
little
and
those
mostly
trivial
things
Thor

half

from
Broadcasting

because
the
taxi
driver
sent
to

him
understood
he
had
been

to

reasonable
enough
request

reckoned

had
had
the
stars
and
stripes
sewn
on
to
the
bottom
of
his
jeans
Enoch
Powell's
eyes
filling
with
tears
when
I
asked
if
he
was
an
emotional
man
A
J
P
Taylor
on
his
seventy-fifth
birthday
admitting
he
had
never
been
offered
an
honour
and
when
I
asked
him
which
he
would
like
if
given
the
choice
his
replying
A
baronetcy
because
it
would
make
my
elder
son
so
dreadfully
annoyed
But
there
were
some
characters
who
for
one
reason
or
another
I
have
cause
to
remember
The
novelist
Rebecca
West
for
instance
We
were
due
to
record
a
longish
interview
with
her
one
afternoon
and
over
lunch
at
her
favourite
restaurant
in
Basil
Street
My
producer
Anthony
Rouse
and
I
both
asked
if
there
was
any
subject
in
her
long
life
that
she
did
not
want
touched
upon
She
said
none
Ask
what
you
like
This
clearance
was
important
because
I
did
intend
to
ask
one
or
two
questions
about
a
matter
which
had
already
been
aired
in
several
books
and
articles
her
love
affair
with
H
G
Wells
and
the
child
of
that
union
the
writer
Anthony
West
There
had
been
conflicting
stories
as
to
whether
Anthony
had
been
intended
Wells
having
gone
on
record
as
saying
he
had
been
conceived
in
a
moment
of
carelessness
professor
Gordon
Ray
who
edited
the
West-Wells
correspondence
as
saying
it
was
a
deliberate
attempt
by
Wells
to
keep
Rebecca
with
him
and
Rebecca
herself
as
saying
Wells
cheated
me
of
all
but
one
child
Was
the
child
intended
I
asked
and
she
answered
firmly
The
child
was
not
intended
A
day
or
two
later
Anthony
Rouse
and
I
were
astonished
to
hear
that
her
agents
were
demanding
the
interview
be
withdrawn
because
as
she
complained
in
a
letter
to
the
BBC's
Director
General
Hugh
Carleton-Greene
we
had
given
her
a
solemn
undertaking
over
lunch
not
to
mention
the
matter
of
Wells
and
their
son
at
all
I
suppose
she
thought
that
Greene
would
not
ask
us
to
confirm
what
she
had
said
but
chide
us
for
impropriety
on
the
strength
of
her
word
alone
Whatever
her
reasoning
I
was
greatly
shocked
that
a
woman
of
her
achievements
and
reputation
should
stoop
to
such
shabby
fibbing
A
good
example
of
how
upset
people
could
be
in
those
days
by
the
questioning
of
their
religious
beliefs
occurred
in
my
interview
with
Basil
Hume
soon
after
he
had
received
his
cardinal's
hat
Before
the
interview
we
talked
over
coffee
in
his
study
next
door
to
Westminster
Cathedral
A
long
lean
man
with
an
ascetic
face
he
looked
the
celibate
monk
he
had
always
been
but
in
private
conversation
he
was
unpompous
outgoing
witty
When
he
told
me
that
he
had
inherited
the
cardinal's
robes
of
his
predecessor
Cardinal
Heenan
and
I
asked
if
they
fitted
he
said
No
But
I
have
a
gem
of
a
nun
who's
a
wizard
with
a
needle
and
after
she'd
taken
a
tuck
in
the
waist
and
put
two
inches
on
the
hem
they
looked
almost
tailor-made
He
also
spoke
of
an
occasion
when
dressed
in
his
archbishop's
robes
after
some
function
he
had
hailed
a
taxi
to
go
home
and
realized
he
had
no
money
I
thought
if
I
tell
the
driver
I'm
a
real
archbishop
and
I'll
pay
him
the
other
end
he'll
just
say
Oh
stuff
it
mate!
Luckily
Reggie
Bosanquet
was
standing
nearby
so
I
borrowed
a
quid
off
him
When
it
came
to
the
interview
he
was
somewhat
nervous
and
on
the
defensive
not
being
an
old
hand
at
it
and
while
I
did
my
best
to
make
him
feel
at
ease
I
felt
it
incumbent
to
put
questions
about
the
Roman
Catholic
Church's
teachings
on
divorce
homosexuality
abortion
celibacy
etc
the
answers
to
which
I
believed
would
be
of
interest
to
Catholics
and
non-Catholics
alike
Being
an
honest
man
he
tried
to
answer
honestly
and
there
were
times
when
he
clearly
found
it
difficult
to
reconcile
the
absolutism
of
his
Church's
dogma
with
the
dictate
of
his
own
conscience
Noting
and
regretting
his
discomfiture
the
public
subsequently
turned
on
the
questioner
By
his
assurance
condescension
ease
of
posture
and
conversational
initiative
said
a
Times
editorial
Mr
Kennedy
might
just
as
well
have
been
a
bishop
testing
a
candidate
for
ordination
Those
looking
for
a
sign
of
grace
or
spiritual
solace
from
the
Cardinal
had
to
make
do
with
what
The
Times
called
exemplary
patience
and
meekness
and
writers
to
the
letters
column
taxed
me
with
shallowness
and
poor
taste
But
I
had
my
supporters
Claiming
that
millions
of
people
had
had
their
lives
damaged
by
the
teachings
of
Roman
Catholicism
one
correspondent
wrote
There
should
be
no
restraint
in
asking
the
most
searching
questions
of
a
man
who
aspires
to
bring
people
and
their
children
into
the
Catholic
fold
As
with
the
comments
of
Heald
Shawcross
and
others
after
my
documentary
on
the
police
I
do
not
believe
that
such
an
interview
would
attract
that
sort
of
attention
today
But
then
today
that
kind
of
interview
rarely
happens
I
also
interviewed
two
healers
One
was
the
famous
Harry
Edwards
whom
I
visited
with
Anthony
Rouse
at
his
home
and
healing
centre
in
Surrey
After
the
interview
I
mentioned
as
casually
as
I
could
that
as
a
result
of
blocked
sinuses
I
had
lost
my
sense
of
smell
with
the
exceptions
of
petrol
laundry
and
excrement
for
years
and
could
he
think
of
any
way
of
restoring
it
He
leaned
towards
me
put
the
middle
finger
of
each
hand
on
either
side
of
my
nose
and
with
a
look
of
intense
concentration
rubbed
each
one
gently
up
and
down
Within
a
few
minutes
I
not
only
felt
but
heard
the
tissue
in
the
sinuses
beginning
to
break
up
and
by
the
time
he
had
finished
both
were
completely
clear
They
remained
clear
and
my
sense
of
smell
returned
for
two
years
Bruce
Macmanaway's
achievements
were
even
more
remarkable
I
had
known
Bruce
for
some
years
as
he
often
ministered
to
friends
and
on
two
or
three
occasions
when
he
had
laid
his
hands
on
my
back
the
heat
emanating
from
them
was
like
a
blowtorch
He
had
discovered
his
gift
for
healing
quite
by
chance
Attending
on
the
battlefield
to
a
wounded
soldier
who
was
crying
out
with
pain
he
took
the
soldier's
hand
in
his
At
once
the
soldier
stopped
crying
the
pain
having
disappeared
but
as
soon
as
Bruce
removed
his
hand
it
returned
Bruce
had
a
simple
pendulum
of
the
kind
people
employ
to
locate
water
and
which
he
used
for
diagnosis
To
show
how
it
worked
he
ran
it
lightly
around
my
producer
while
we
were
discussing
the
shape
of
the
interview
When
he
reached
his
right
thigh
the
pendulum
became
quite
agitated
Something
not
quite
right
there
said
Bruce
The
producer
looked
stunned
I
had
an
operation
there
last
month
he
said
Bruce
said
I
can
use
the
pendulum
to
do
more
than
that
If
you
were
to
write
down
on
a
sheet
of
paper
half
a
dozen
simple
statements
of
fact
which
were
either
true
or
false
and
then
turn
the
questions
face
down
the
pendulum
will
come
up
with
which
are
which
I
made
no
comment
on
this
at
the
time
though
privately
I
thought
it
a
brash
boast
but
when
we
met
for
the
interview
I
asked
if
he
had
brought
the
pendulum
with
him
He
said
he
had
Half-way
through
the
interview
I
reminded
him
of
his
claim
pulled
out
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
I
had
written
three
true
statements
and
three
false
ones
and
putting
it
face
down
on
the
table
invited
him
to
use
the
pendulum
to
indicate
the
correct
answers
He
got
the
first
one
right
the
second
one
right
the
third
one
right
the
fourth
one
right
the
fifth
one
wrong
the
sixth
one
right
I
thought
it
was
a
tour
de
force
but
he
seemed
far
more
concerned
about
getting
one
wrong
It
could
have
been
the
studio
lights
than
pleased
at
getting
five
right
At
this
time
still
a
regular
smoker
I
made
one
film
which
made
me
drastically
change
my
views
about
it
This
was
a
documentary
on
cancer
research
One
distressing
sequence
we
filmed
in
the
laboratories
portrayed
mice
with
their
little
noses
pushed
into
holes
in
a
plastic
tube
along
which
was
passed
tobacco
smoke
equivalent
to
that
inhaled
by
a
human
on
twenty
cigarettes
a
day
I
forget
now
what
the
simulated
time
factor
was
I
think
twenty
years
but
the
upshot
was
that
three-quarters
of
the
mice
developed
lung
cancer
and
died
More
disturbing
was
this
statistic
that
while
seven
out
of
eight
of
those
who
died
of
lung
cancer
were
heavy
smokers
only
one
heavy
smoker
in
eight
died
of
lung
cancer
This
may
have
brought
comfort
to
some
but
statistically
it
was
as
risky
as
playing
Russian
roulette
and
I
laid
off
smoking
for
the
next
seven
years
One
film
which
sadly
was
never
made
was
a
documentary
proposed
by
Alasdair
Milne
then
Controller
of
BBC
Scotland
to
celebrate
the
seventy-fifth
birthday
of
the
Queen
Mother
She
had
not
yet
been
interviewed
on
television
or
radio
but
we
thought
it
worthwhile
approaching
her
private
secretary
to
see
if
she
might
consider
it
As
a
result
I
was
bidden
to
Clarence
House
for
a
pre-lunch
gin
and
tonic
with
her
and
Princess
Margaret
She
asked
what
I
had
in
mind
and
I
said
an
informal
conversation
about
the
principal
events
of
her
life
from
her
girlhood
at
Glamis
Castle
to
the
present
day
She
seemed
to
consider
the
proposal
favourably
and
Princess
Margaret
who
I
knew
was
keen
on
the
idea
was
supportive
Then
the
Queen
Mother
said
I'm
sure
you'll
understand
there
is
one
subject
I
couldn't
possibly
talk
about
I
was
pretty
certain
what
it
was
but
I
wanted
to
hear
her
say
it
The
abdication
Not
at
all
not
even
briefly
I
said
She
was
adamant
I'm
afraid
not
She
gave
me
a
winning
smile
I'm
so
sorry
For
the
next
week
I
thought
long
and
hard
about
undertaking
an
interview
with
the
Queen
Mother
which
would
cover
every
aspect
of
her
life
but
the
great
historical
event
which
had
changed
it
for
ever
which
had
propelled
her
and
her
husband
to
the
throne
had
made
happy
and
glorious
a
reign
which
might
otherwise
have
been
disastrous
yet
which
was
tragically
cut
short
by
illness
and
death
and
which
in
the
long
run
had
made
her
far
and
away
the
most
loved
of
all
the
members
of
the
Royal
Family
I
was
not
proposing
to
ask
her
about
her
relationship
or
lack
of
it
with
Edward
VIII
and
Mrs
Simpson
or
to
what
degree
she
blamed
them
for
the
unexpected
and
at
the
time
unwelcome
change
in
her
life
But
not
to
have
mentioned
the
subject
at
all
to
leave
a
void
which
demanded
to
be
filled
that
it
seemed
to
me
would
have
been
Hamlet
without
the
prince
or
more
accurately
Queen
Mother
And
so
with
regrets
the
project
lapsed

LONDON
My
village
my
home-town
each
had
a
kind
of
duck-pond
centre
but
London
had
no
centre
at
all
just
squat
little
streets
endlessly
proliferating
themselves
like
ripples
in
estuary
mud
I
arrived
at
Paddington
in
the
early
evening
and
walked
around
for
a
while
The
sky
was
different
here
high
wide
and
still
rosy
with
smoke
and
the
weltering
sun
There
was
a
smell
of
rank
oil
rotting
fish
and
vegetables
hot
pavements
and
trodden
tar
and
a
sense
of
surging
pressure
the
heavy
used-up
air
of
the
cheek-by-jowl
life
around
me
the
families
fermenting
behind
slack
coloured
curtains
above
shops
and
in
resounding
tenements
sons
changing
their
shirts
daughters
drying
their
hair
waistcoated
fathers
staring
at
their
tea
and
in
the
streets
the
packed
buses
grinding
nose
to
tail
and
the
great
night
coming
on
I
was
excited
having
got
here
but
also
unprepared
and
I
wasn't
sure
what
I
was
going
to
do
But
I
had
Cleo's
address
I
didn't
know
anyone
else
so
I
thought
this
was
the
time
to
use
it
I'd
met
Cleo
in
the
spring
in
a
Tolstoyan
settlement
near
Stroud
where
she
was
living
in
a
borrowed
caravan
together
with
her
handsome
father
an
eagle-nosed
left-wing
agitator
and
her
distressed
and
well-born
mother
Their
origins
were
uncertain
but
they'd
recently
fled
from
America
where
I
suspect
the
father
had
been
in
some
political
trouble
The
sixteen-year-old
girl
was
not
the
kind
I'd
been
used
to
and
her
beauty
had
knocked
me
silly
She'd
had
a
husky
nutty
Anglo-American
accent
huge
brown
eyes
flecked
like
crumbled
honey
a
smooth
leggy
figure
lithe
as
an
Indian
pony
and
we'd
pretended
to
be
in
love
The
family
were
penniless
but
they
had
connections
and
friends
were
always
lending
them
houses
and
the
address
of
the
last
one
somewhere
on
Putney
Heath
sounded
very
grand
indeed
When
I
finally
got
there
having
walked
several
miles
through
the
dusk
the
house
appeared
to
have
been
hit
by
a
bomb
only
half
a
wing
and
the
main
staircase
still
standing
in
a
huge
garden
of
churned-up
roots
They
were
sitting
on
the
staircase
which
was
open
to
the
sky
and
seemed
rather
surprised
to
see
me
except
for
lovely
Cleo
who
cried
I
knew
it!
and
ran
down
the
steps
to
meet
me
She
had
kept
up
superbly
with
my
memories
of
her
and
looked
even
better
than
I
expected
her
body
packed
beautifully
into
her
shirt
and
shorts
and
her
skin
the
colour
of
rosewood
You
walked
it
didn't
you
I
told
you
Daddy
She
led
me
proudly
up
the
eroded
staircase
then
took
me
to
her
room
and
showed
me
my
bundle
of
letters
which
lay
wrapped
in
her
scented
nightdress
So
I
was
invited
to
stay
Cleo
burnt
my
clothes
and
fitted
me
out
with
some
of
her
father's
The
mansion
was
being
torn
down
to
make
room
for
a
block
of
flats
and
the
father
had
a
job
with
the
builders
meanwhile
with
the
half-ruin
to
live
in
they
were
temporarily
secure
and
the
mother
was
slowly
recovering
her
senses
I
slept
on
the
floor
in
the
remaining
fragment
of
ball-room
and
ate
with
the
family
in
the
Victorian
kitchen
whose
tall
Gothic
windows
looked
from
the
lip
of
the
Heath
across
London
to
the
Hampstead
hills
I
was
in
luck
and
I
knew
it
and
took
it
easy
at
first
It
seemed
a
nice
soft
spot
to
be
in
Sometimes
the
father
in
his
loud
public
voice
would
lecture
me
on
the
theory
of
anarchy
on
the
necessity
for
political
and
personal
freedom
and
on
his
contempt
for
the
moral
law
When
he
was
out
the
mother
pale
and
damp
round
the
eyes
would
talk
about
her
childhood
home
in
the
shires
and
lament
the
scruffy
world
of
conspiratorial
garrets
through
which
this
attractive
bounder
had
led
her
At
other
times
the
daughter
heart-stoppingly
voluptuous
in
her
tight
Californian
pants
would
lead
me
by
the
hand
through
the
ruined
garden
to
the
last
clump
of
still-rooted
myrtles
then
crouch
bare-kneed
and
pull
me
down
beside
her
and
demand
to
know
my
ideological
convictions
Beautiful
Cleo
she
never
knew
what
she
did
to
me
her
eyes
slanting
under
the
myrtle
leaves
her
coiled
russet
limbs
like
something
from
a
Rousseau
jungle
her
chatter
never
still
for
a
moment
But
not
of
what
I
expected
never
a
word
about
love
or
my
hunger
or
the
summer
night
The
funeral
baked
meats
of
her
father's
mind
was
all
she
seemed
able
to
serve
me
He
was
the
one
of
course
and
I
was
not
old
enough
to
replace
him
I
thought
her
the
most
ravishing
and
wasted
child
in
the
world
Then
one
night
I
took
her
out
on
to
the
twilit
Heath
where
lovers
lay
thick
as
sheaves
We
walked
miles
round
the
common
and
Cleo
never
drew
breath
her
lovely
mouth
was
a
political
megaphone
Finally
I
pushed
her
against
a
tree
and
desperately
kissed
her
She
lent
me
her
lips
like
an
improving
book
But
I
must
have
the
Movement
You
understand
don't
you
You
must
join
the
Party
she
said
I
didn't
give
up
I
made
one
last
try
After
all
I
was
in
considerable
torment
So
next
morning
at
dawn
I
fetched
one
of
the
builder's
ladders
and
climbed
through
her
bed-room
window
She
lay
easily
sleeping
in
her
rose-coloured
nightdress
a
soft
breathing
heap
of
love
The
hushed
dawn
the
first
birds
and
me
in
my
black
Russian
pyjamas
surely
she
must
melt
to
this
magic
moment
As
I
slipped
into
her
bed
she
rolled
drowsily
into
my
arms
then
woke
and
her
body
froze
If
Daddy
knew
about
this
he'd
murder
you
she
said
It
was
no
idle
figure
of
speech
Scrambling
back
down
the
ladder
in
the
dawn's
early
light
I
realized
that
blood
could
be
thicker
than
theory
Later
that
day
Cleo's
father
got
me
a
job
with
the
builders
and
gave
me
the
address
of
some
Putney
lodgings
I
don't
know
what
she
had
told
him
but
he'd
acted
swiftly
It
seemed
a
reasonable
compromise
between
New
Thought
and
the
horsewhip
On
my
own
once
again
I
found
a
snug
little
room
over
an
eating-house
in
the
Upper
Richmond
Road
a
shambling
second-floor
back
which
overhung
the
railway
and
rocked
all
day
to
the
passing
trains
while
the
hot
meaty
steam
of
boiling
pies
filtered
up
through
cracks
in
the
floor
The
cafe
downstairs
was
a
shadowy
tunnel
lined
with
high-backed
wooden
pews
carbolic-scrubbed
and
exclusively
male
with
all
the
comforts
of
a
mediaeval
refectory
My
rent
of
twenty-five
shillings
a
week
included
the
furnished
room
and
three
cafe
meals
a
day
a
carte
blanche
arrangement
which
I
exploited
fully
and
which
introduced
me
to
new
ways
of
eating
The
blackboard
menu
propped
on
the
pavement
outside
offered
a
list
as
immutable
as
the
elements
Bubble
Squeak
Liver
and
B
Toad-in-the-Hole
Meat
Pudding
or
Pie
My
favourite
was
the
pie
a
little
basin
of
meat
wrapped
in
a
caul
of
suety
dough
which
was
kept
boiling
all
day
in
a
copper
cauldron
in
a
cupboard
under
the
stairs
Turned
out
on
the
plate
it
steamed
like
a
sodden
napkin
emitting
a
mournful
odour
of
laundries
but
once
pricked
with
the
fork
it
exploded
magnificently
with
a
rich
lava
of
beefy
juices
There
must
have
been
over
a
pound
of
meat
in
each
separate
pie
a
complete
working-man's
meal
for
sixpence
And
remembering
the
thin
days
at
home
when
meat
was
only
for
Sundays
I
ate
at
least
one
of
them
every
day
Otherwise
I
was
encouraged
to
ring
the
changes
on
the
house's
limited
permutations
Squeak
Toad
Liver
and
B
or
as
a
privilege
an
occasional
herring
A
mug
of
tea
at
each
meal
was
of
course
served
without
asking
and
was
so
strong
you
could
trot
a
mouse
on
it
As
for
afters
there
was
a
postscript
at
the
foot
of
the
menu
which
seemed
to
be
painted
in
permanent
enamel
During
the
Present
Hot
Spell
Why
Not
Try
a
Cold
Sweet
Winter
and
summer
it
was
custard
and
prunes
Arnold
the
proprietor
who
was
also
my
landlord
was
a
man
in
his
early
thirties
a
rounded
dandy
with
heavy
cream-white
jowls
and
delicate
parboiled
hands
He
did
all
the
work
alone
both
the
cooking
and
serving
and
moved
with
the
rolling
dignity
of
a
eunuch
dressed
in
tight
cotton
gowns
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
which
also
gave
him
the
appearance
of
one
of
his
cloth-wrapped
pies
He
was
bald
large-headed
red-lipped
and
corseted
and
was
given
to
abstractions
silence
and
reveries
and
he
seemed
clearly
to
be
a
cut
above
his
clients
though
if
he
thought
so
he
never
showed
it
Each
day
before
breakfast
he
padded
around
the
tables
laying
out
the
morning
newspapers
like
hymn-sheets
and
these
again
were
scrupulously
changed
in
the
evening
The
customers
also
had
the
benefit
of
his
soft-voiced
summaries
I've
never
known
a
man
who
gave
to
this
particular
job
such
a
sense
of
modest
almost
priest-like
dedication
advising
and
serving
the
labourers
at
his
table
and
taking
their
coppers
like
a
church
collection
In
fact
this
ascetic
purveyor
of
gross
Toads
and
Squeaks
was
something
of
a
mystery
One
might
have
imagined
him
to
have
chosen
the
job
as
a
purge
an
act
of
self-abasement
but
certainly
not
for
the
money
I
lived
for
six
months
in
his
house
but
I
never
knew
him
though
I
knew
he
had
another
life
I
knew
for
instance
about
the
two
pretty
children
who
visited
him
briefly
each
Saturday
night
And
that
in
his
first-floor
back
he
kept
in
careful
seclusion
a
young
and
beautiful
wife
Sometimes
as
I
climbed
to
my
room
I
saw
her
standing
in
her
half-open
doorway
a
tantalising
strip
of
voluptuous
boredom
her
hair
piled
high
and
elaborately
set
her
eyes
burning
like
landing
lights
She
wore
a
white
silk
wrap
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
and
her
toe-nails
were
painted
green
She
was
about
my
own
age
but
she
never
spoke
Nor
did
Arnold
ever
mention
her
My
job
at
the
buildings
took
it
out
of
me
at
first
and
I
lived
at
a
pitch
of
healthy
exhaustion
All
day
I
pushed
barrows
of
wet
cement
till
my
muscles
stretched
and
burned
At
night
I
returned
to
the
steaming
cafe
ate
my
pie
then
climbed
to
my
backstairs
room
where
I
sat
half-dozing
at
the
window
table
gazing
down
at
the
long
green
trains
It
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
I'd
had
a
room
of
my
own
uncluttered
with
sisters
and
brothers
and
I
spread
all
over
it
throwing
my
clothes
about
and
keeping
the
door
well
locked
and
bolted
Grateful
for
privacy
at
last
I
was
content
just
to
sit
there
lord
of
the
room
and
its
chromium
furniture
spending
the
long
summer
evenings
nodding
alone
at
the
table
or
drawing
girls
or
writing
short
sleepy
poems
London
waited
outside
a
stubby
plateau
of
chimneys
a
low
mutter
of
dragging
sound
but
at
the
beginning
there
was
little
I
could
do
about
it
My
body
was
too
used
up
It
took
a
little
while
to
get
toughened-up
to
the
job
to
the
stiff
hours
of
blistering
labour
which
wore
my
hands
into
holes
and
pulled
my
muscles
about
into
new
and
unaccustomed
contortions
I
was
dead-beat
at
first
and
walked
in
a
tottering
daze
but
I
was
young
and
I
hardened
fast
Soon
my
palms
had
callouses
rough
as
salted
leather
which
I
could
rub
together
with
pride
At
last
I
could
get
home
in
the
evening
without
falling
into
a
stupor
I
could
even
begin
to
look
about
me
Of
course
I'd
not
much
identity
with
the
city
yet
it
was
just
rooftops
and
a
changing
sky
a
thump
of
radios
coming
from
open
windows
and
the
summer
yelp
of
the
back-street
children
And
the
frail
cord
with
my
family
was
still
uncut
Boot-boxes
of
flowers
came
by
post
from
my
mother
sweet
slipshod
gatherings
from
the
fields
and
hedges
wrapped
in
damp
moss
and
ivy
leaves
Then
I
made
a
small
break-through
I
won
a
poetry
prize
in
a
weekly
competition
organized
by
a
newspaper
The
Sunday
Referee
for
a
poem
I'd
dashed
off
with
a
sixpenny
postal
order
and
never
expected
to
hear
of
again
Arnold
showed
it
to
me
one
morning
his
red
mouth
twitching
and
it
was
the
first
of
mine
I'd
ever
seen
printed
Is
this
really
you
he
asked
fastidiously
I
wasn't
aware
you
had
such
beautiful
thoughts
Soon
after
this
I
met
Philip
O'Connor
distributing
leaflets
on
Putney
Common
a
quick
ready
youth
with
a
fine
hungry
face
and
a
shock
of
thick
obsidian
curls
We
were
both
of
us
living
alone
at
that
time
scribbling
poetry
in
neighbouring
streets
so
for
a
while
we
visited
each
other
quite
often
establishing
a
defensive
minority
of
two
To
me
he
had
an
adolescent
mystery
about
him
a
frenetic
melancholy
like
a
schoolboy
Hamlet
and
his
poems
were
the
most
extravagant
I'd
read
until
then
rhapsodic
eruptions
of
surrealist
fantasy
I
was
impressed
by
his
poems
he
thought
little
of
mine
I
was
the
older
he
was
paternal
He
used
to
lie
on
my
bed
nervously
scratching
his
curls
and
switching
his
dark
eyes
on
and
off
reciting
his
latest
verses
in
clear
cold
tones
snappy
and
rather
bitter
You
and
I
are
the
only
true
voices
left
alive
in
the
world
he'd
say
When
using
my
room
his
manners
were
perfect
Not
so
on
his
own
home
ground
when
his
claims
were
more
self-centred
But
he
had
a
nice
sense
of
territory
Another
friend
of
that
period
was
six-foot
Billy
who
ate
regularly
in
the
cafe
downstairs
a
stranded
Negro
sailor
from
Troy
Missouri
who
had
either
jumped
ship
or
had
lost
his
way
I
never
knew
where
he
slept
or
how
he
lived
but
every
evening
he'd
be
there
in
his
pew
dropping
great
lumps
of
butter
into
his
hot
strong
tea
and
carefully
stripping
the
bones
from
a
kipper
His
huge
fat
cheeks
were
lightly
scarred
by
knives
and
the
marks
of
knuckledusters
ran
across
his
eyebrows
But
he
was
sleepily
gentle
never
raised
his
voice
and
his
favourite
pb
n=41>
diversions
seemed
to
be
tea
and
gossip
Billy
was
an
excellent
listener
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
bore
him
He'd
salute
the
dullest
story
with
the
most
flattering
attention
Waal
ah'll
go
slash
mah
wrists
if
that
ain't
sumpin
he'd
murmur
You
may
hang
me
up
by
mah
entrails
Sometimes
he'd
disappear
for
a
few
days
then
pop
up
beaming
Gouge
mah
eyes
shuh
good
to
see
you
Then
we'd
go
next
door
for
a
game
of
billiards
which
he
played
with
a
velvet
touch
But
he
didn't
last
long
They
finally
caught
up
with
him
A
dozen
coppers
with
rolled-up
macs
Stepping
gingerly
into
the
cafe
expecting
a
struggle
But
he
went
with
them
like
a
child
Then
my
days
with
Arnold
too
were
numbered
A
girl
came
to
live
on
the
floor
above
me
She
moved
into
the
attic
cupboard
just
under
the
roof
which
till
then
had
only
stored
potatoes
The
girl
seemed
to
do
no
work
though
occasionally
I'd
hear
her
gramophone
playing
and
the
sound
of
her
bare
feet
dancing
Sometimes
we'd
meet
on
the
stairs
and
have
to
struggle
together
to
get
round
the
bend
in
the
banisters
A
couple
of
inches
from
mine
her
eyes
never
blinked
Her
hair
smelt
of
pies
and
doughnuts
D'you
see
that
film
called
The
Rat
she
asked
me
one
day
You're
his
bleedin
image
you
are
Her
friends
came
in
the
evening
and
left
in
the
morning
Then
Arnold
would
take
her
breakfast
up
on
a
tray
At
last
apologetically
he
said
he'd
be
wanting
my
room
It
seemed
he
was
extending
the
business

Sometime
before
Mr
Deakin's
demise
he
had
appointed
me
as
number
two
correspondent
in
Paris
in
succession
to
Charles
Hargrove
whom
he
sent
to
Bonn
Unfortunately
just
before
taking
up
this
post
to
which
Claudie
was
particularly
looking
forward
I
went
down
with
mumps
which
deteriorated
into
jaundice
Being
ill
in
rat-infested
Cardinal's
Wharf
was
no
joke
The
family
doctor
was
loath
to
travel
to
such
distant
parts
and
the
only
local
one
a
scruffy
old
Hungarian
spoke
very
little
English
On
his
first
visit
he
poured
my
sinister-looking
urine
sample
down
the
bathroom
washbasin
dismissing
Claudie's
protest
at
his
lack
of
hygiene
with
the
phrase
it
ees
not
a
septicus
but
an
anti-septicus
an
excuse
which
no
more
convinced
Claudie
on
that
occasion
than
it
did
when
parroted
by
me
in
later
years
to
justify
my
lazily
using
many
hotel
bedroom
basins
for
roughly
the
same
unhygienic
purpose
Soon
my
condition
became
quite
critical
and
I
was
carted
off
by
ambulance
to
St
Thomas's
Hospital
where
I
stayed
for
four
months
under
the
care
of
a
young
doctor
Hugh
de
Wardener
who
went
on
to
become
one
of
the
world's
leading
renal
experts
At
first
he
was
completely
baffled
by
my
exact
kind
of
jaundice
That
I
had
jaundice
was
clear
enough
since
my
skin
had
gone
canary
yellow
But
it
couldn't
be
the
strain
it
seemed
to
be
he
told
Claudie
because
that
one
could
only
be
caught
through
living
in
rat-infested
conditions
which
were
unlikely
to
apply
to
me
Furthermore
that
particular
strain
had
become
rare
to
the
point
of
non-existence
a
bad
memory
from
the
days
of
Victorian
slums
After
Claudie
had
reluctantly
and
shamefacedly
put
him
in
the
picture
about
Cardinal's
Wharf
he
became
really
interested
I
cannot
remember
what
my
virus
was
called
but
it
was
sufficiently
rare
for
doctors
from
other
hospitals
to
want
to
come
in
to
take
a
look
And
the
nurses
taking
their
cue
from
the
doctors
also
began
to
treat
me
as
something
special
Had
I
not
been
feeling
so
lousy
and
so
frustrated
about
the
receding
chances
of
taking
up
my
appointment
in
Paris
my
lot
would
have
been
quite
enviable
How
quickly
one
gets
used
to
hospital
life
particularly
if
you
have
an
interesting
disease
which
endows
you
with
a
kind
of
star
status
Instead
of
being
worried
by
new
and
alarming
symptoms
I
rather
welcomed
them
since
they
only
served
to
deepen
Dr
Wardener
and
his
team's
interest
In
the
kingdom
of
the
sick
the
seriously
ill
patient
is
king
Dr
Wardener
did
not
take
the
traditional
view
that
rich
and
fatty
foods
are
bad
for
jaundice
On
the
contrary
he
said
if
the
patient
fancies
such
foods
let
him
have
them
Likewise
drink
Anything
to
keep
your
strength
and
morale
up
When
I
told
my
mother
this
she
was
rather
put
out
I
think
she
suspected
the
cause
of
my
jaundice
had
been
over-indulgence
of
one
sort
or
another
too
many
of
Claudie's
French
sauces
perhaps
and
had
seen
it
as
heaven's
warning
that
I
should
go
on
a
strict
diet
Even
more
to
the
point
Nellie
her
cook
had
been
told
to
prepare
a
daily
consignment
of
boiled
fish
and
it
was
too
late
to
change
plans
now
My
father's
reaction
was
quite
different
Hampers
of
smoked
salmon
grouse
and
champagne
arrived
from
Fortnums
How
characteristically
irresponsible
sniffed
my
mother
when
she
saw
them
What
I
dreaded
was
that
he
and
she
would
both
arrive
at
my
bedside
at
the
same
time
Fear
of
this
gave
me
nightmares
and
worried
me
more
than
anything
to
do
with
the
disease
itself
Claudie
and
the
nurses
worked
out
an
elaborate
warning
system
which
never
failed
although
there
were
some
close
shaves
My
father
would
make
a
joke
of
my
fears
offering
to
get
under
the
bed
or
hide
in
a
cupboard
as
in
a
Feydeau
farce
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
But
for
me
it
was
anything
but
a
joke
In
my
weakened
state
at
one
point
I
weighed
less
than
seven
stone
the
shock
might
well
have
been
more
than
my
heart
could
stand
To
begin
with
friends
would
visit
me
regularly
But
as
the
weeks
stretched
to
months
the
visits
became
rarer
This
was
not
because
of
any
lack
of
willingness
on
their
part
They
suggested
coming
but
I
put
them
off
What
was
going
on
in
the
world
of
the
healthy
seemed
so
much
less
interesting
than
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
of
the
sick
Every
piece
of
hospital
gossip
brought
to
me
by
the
nurses
and
doctors
was
eagerly
received
But
The
Times
office
gossip
say
had
lost
all
savour
Friends
who
arrived
rosy-cheeked
and
bursting
with
health
made
me
wince
not
with
envy
but
with
embarrassment
I
had
to
avert
my
eyes
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
someone
healthy
averts
his
eyes
when
faced
by
offensive
illness
Perhaps
this
is
nature's
way
of
consoling
the
sick
More
likely
I
suppose
it
is
a
case
of
when
in
Rome
do
as
Rome
does
Hospitals
have
their
own
values
their
own
routines
their
own
horizons
and
after
a
time
a
patient
starts
finding
these
natural
and
normal
and
those
of
the
healthy
world
unnatural
and
abnormal
A
preoccupation
of
mine
for
example
which
visitors
could
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
share
was
the
colour
of
my
urine
Nothing
else
occupied
my
waking
or
indeed
dreaming
hours
more
than
this
Passing
water
was
a
matter
of
high
drama
If
the
urine
spurting
into
the
bottle
made
a
dark
yellow
froth
or
a
darker
yellow
than
the
time
before
this
meant
that
I
was
getting
worse
a
lighter
froth
on
the
other
hand
indicated
improvement
On
each
occasion
of
course
there
was
room
for
doubt
Perhaps
the
sun
was
shining
brighter
Not
wishing
to
rely
on
my
own
eye
I
would
consult
the
nurses
for
a
second
opinion
and
even
the
cleaners
Not
that
I
cared
all
that
much
about
getting
better
After
three
months
or
so
I
had
given
up
hope
on
that
score
Concern
about
the
colour
had
become
almost
an
end
in
itself
like
some
piece
of
research
whose
original
purpose
the
scholar
has
long
since
forgotten
Nor
was
it
only
the
colour
of
my
urine
which
required
regular
examination
So
did
the
colour
of
my
skin
and
the
colour
of
my
tongue
not
to
mention
the
colour
of
my
liver
slivers
of
which
were
occasionally
extracted
by
Dr
Wardener
so
as
to
enable
him
to
know
more
about
my
progress
or
rather
lack
of
progress
With
all
these
pressing
matters
on
my
mind
I
found
the
affairs
of
the
great
world
a
most
unwelcome
distraction
and
could
hardly
wait
for
kind
visitors
to
be
gone
so
as
to
concentrate
again
on
the
important
business
in
hand
So
preoccupied
was
I
with
my
illness
that
when
Claudie
gave
me
the
marvellous
news
that
she
was
three
months
gone
in
pregnancy
I
did
not
immediately
realise
that
she
could
not
possibly
go
on
living
alone
at
Cardinal's
Wharf
amidst
the
rats
and
the
grime
Fortunately
my
Cambridge
friend
Roger
Lubbock
now
a
London
publisher
did
Giving
Claudie
a
lift
home
after
dark
he
realised
for
the
first
time
how
brave
she
had
been
to
stick
it
out
and
immediately
arranged
for
her
to
come
and
stay
with
Oliver
and
Patty
Knox
in
Adam's
Row
where
he
was
lodging
at
the
time
Roger
and
Olly
had
been
friends
at
Eton
and
then
at
King's
and
also
in
the
navy
in
whose
service
Roger
had
been
a
great
deal
more
active
winning
the
DSC
on
motor
torpedo
boats
than
had
Olly
who
for
the
most
part
had
been
at
Bletchley
where
his
father
Dillwyn
Knox
played
such
an
important
part
in
breaking
the
German
Enigma
code
Claudie's
life
was
immediately
transformed
For
Adam's
Row
in
Mayfair
next
door
to
the
Connaught
Hotel
was
a
very
different
environment
to
the
south
bank
in
the
longer
run
my
life
was
too
since
the
Knoxs
and
the
Lubbocks
were
to
become
our
closest
friends
Possibly
it
was
news
of
the
baby
on
the
way
that
jolted
me
into
getting
better
In
any
event
one
morning
instead
of
there
being
a
head
of
yellow
froth
on
my
urine
there
were
transparent
Lux-like
bubbles
the
long-awaited
sign
of
recovery
A
fortnight
or
so
later
Claudie
invited
Dr
Wardener
to
have
a
glass
of
my
father's
champagne
and
he
called
the
nurses
in
to
drink
my
health
The
phrase
made
me
a
little
sad
I
had
seen
Dr
Wardener
daily
often
twice
daily
for
four
months
in
the
course
of
which
there
had
been
some
pretty
darkish
nights
of
the
soul
and
this
relationship
so
close
and
highly
charged
was
about
to
end
It
was
not
unlike
the
drinks
between
old
comrades
the
night
before
demobilisation
which
are
as
much
wake
as
celebration
And
just
as
old
comrades
promise
to
keep
in
touch
in
civvy
street
so
did
Dr
Wardener
and
I
promise
to
keep
in
touch
in
the
world
of
the
healthy
But
we
never
did
Our
final
conversation
however
has
often
come
back
to
me
I
asked
him
whether
drinking
might
induce
a
recurrence
of
my
jaundice
and
he
pooh-poohed
the
idea
The
hangovers
may
be
worse
he
said
but
that
is
all
They
certainly
have
been
and
so
far
that
has
been
all
Something
else
from
that
period
also
brings
it
back
to
me
John
Raymond
a
new
friend
on
The
Times
who
went
on
to
become
a
fine
literary
critic
gave
me
a
beautiful
edition
of
Gibbon's
Decline
and
Fall
of
the
Roman
Empire
to
read
in
hospital
It
is
on
my
shelves
now
and
few
things
fill
me
with
more
nostalgia
than
those
pages
still
stained
yellow
by
my
sweaty
jaundiced
hands
For
convalescence
Claudie
and
I
went
up
to
Dyneley
where
Simon
lent
us
a
cottage
on
the
estate
It
was
the
one
where
James
the
Dyneley
butler
had
been
born
and
bred
along
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
Although
now
very
comfortably
and
costly
done
up
and
ideal
for
the
two
of
us
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
how
its
far
from
large
one
bedroom
could
have
housed
that
entire
family
Rationing
was
still
on
but
the
Cliviger
butcher
Mr
Blackburn
whom
I
had
known
since
childhood
sent
up
lots
of
liver
the
one
meat
which
I
not
unnaturally
did
not
feel
like
eating
Anxious
not
to
appear
ungrateful
I
went
down
to
thank
him
for
his
kind
and
considerate
gesture
which
prompted
him
to
despatch
further
bloodstained
parcels
of
this
sickening
offal
Fortunately
Claudie
was
eating
for
two
and
it
could
well
be
that
Mr
Blackburn's
misplaced
generosity
contributed
greatly
to
the
health
and
beauty
of
Dominique
our
baby
daughter
who
was
born
not
all
that
long
after
In
preparation
for
this
great
event
it
fell
to
Claudie
my
state
of
health
not
being
up
to
the
job
to
find
a
family
home
My
mother
who
had
generously
offered
to
put
up
the
then
princely
sum
of
was
very
keen
on
Baron's
Court
an
area
known
to
me
only
as
an
Underground
station
through
which
people
passed
preferably
as
fast
as
possible
Pressed
to
explain
her
preference
she
said
that
lots
of
her
social
worker
friends
and
colleagues
lived
there
and
loved
it
which
did
not
seem
to
us
a
conclusive
reason
for
supposing
that
we
would
too
With
the
benefit
of
hindsight
I
now
see
that
my
mother
had
a
point
as
was
often
the
case
We
could
probably
have
bought
a
great
mansion
in
Baron's
Court
with
a
large
garden
for
or
in
some
of
the
other
locations
she
also
favoured
Barnes
Wimbledon
Putney
and
Richmond
Our
objections
owed
less
to
snobbery
than
lack
of
imagination
Nobody
we
knew
then
lived
in
those
areas
Indeed
few
people
we
knew
lived
north
of
Hyde
Park
My
father
still
owned
two
houses
in
Belgrave
Square
and
it
somehow
seemed
quite
wrong
even
to
consider
descending
from
Belgravia
to
Baron's
Court
in
one
plunge
That
of
course
was
just
what
my
mother
did
want
for
all
the
old
familiar
reasons
In
the
end
after
much
searching
Claudie
compromised
by
plumping
for
Scarsdale
Villas
not
far
from
both
Kensington
High
Street
and
Earl's
Court
Road
an
area
which
was
not
fashionable
in
those
days
although
it
has
since
become
so
Our
old
house
went
the
other
day
for
three-quarters
of
a
million
alas
three
decades
or
more
after
we
had
sold
it
By
the
time
I
came
south
from
Lancashire
fully
recuperated
Claudie
had
done
all
the
hard
work
of
doing
it
up
moving
in
and
finding
an
au
pair
as
they
had
just
begun
to
be
called
Some
might
say
I
had
it
made
In
fact
that
was
what
Claudie
did
say
or
a
ruder
French
version
of
the
same
Even
getting
to
The
Times
was
easy
by
District
line
to
Blackfriars
from
Earl's
Court
Road
Station
only
a
two-minute
or
so
walk
from
the
house

on
my
return
from
Edinburgh
feeling
desperately
weak
I
wrote
a
review
in
the
Church
of
England
Newspaper
of
T.S
Eliot's
play
The
Confidential
Clerk
which
was
first
performed
at
the
Edinburgh
Festival
The
editor
the
Rev
Clifford
Rhodes
sent
the
review
to
Eliot
who
replied
to
him
very
favourably
on
September
Clifford
Rhodes
passed
on
Eliot's
reply
to
me
He
thanked
Rhodes
for
the
critique
of
his
play
by
me
and
added
I
should
have
acknowledged
it
as
soon
as
I
read
it
for
it
struck
me
as
one
of
the
two
or
three
most
intelligent
reviews
I
had
read
It
seemed
to
me
remarkable
that
anyone
who
could
only
have
seen
the
play
once
and
certainly
not
have
read
it
should
have
grasped
so
much
of
its
intention
This
of
course
made
me
feel
very
cheerful
I
was
already
embarked
on
a
study
of
Eliot
Frank
Sheed
of
Sheed
Ward
commissioned
a
short
book
So
I
continued
my
Eliot
studies
But
in
shortly
after
my
reception
into
the
Church
of
Rome
something
strange
occurred
Something
strange
was
not
surprising
because
foolishly
I
had
been
taking
dexedrine
as
an
appetite
suppressant
so
that
I
would
feel
less
hungry
It
was
a
mad
idea
As
I
worked
on
the
Eliot
book
one
night
the
letters
of
the
words
I
was
reading
became
confused
They
formed
anagrams
and
crosswords
In
a
way
as
long
as
this
sensation
lasted
I
knew
they
were
hallucinations
But
I
didn't
connect
them
with
the
dexedrine
It
is
difficult
to
convey
how
absolutely
fascinating
that
involuntary
word-game
was
I
thought
at
first
that
there
was
a
code
built
into
Eliot's
work
and
tried
to
decipher
it
Next
I
seemed
to
realize
that
this
word-game
went
through
other
books
by
other
authors
It
appeared
that
they
were
phonetics
of
Greek
and
were
extracts
from
the
Greek
dramatists
This
experience
lasted
from
January
to
April
I
saw
Dr
Lieber
a
general
practitioner
in
Wimpole
Street
Dr
Lieber
was
an
old
friend
a
private
that
is
to
say
not
a
National
Health
doctor
He
agreed
to
treat
me
without
fees
until
I
was
better
again
But
he
explained
that
lots
of
women
in
those
days
of
rationing
gave
up
part
of
their
share
to
their
families
and
consequently
suffered
from
under-nourishment
I
know
he
suspected
that
I
ate
the
wrong
food
for
while
I
was
convalescent
in
the
country
he
wrote
to
me
frequently
I
still
have
his
letters
Be
sure
to
eat
the
right
food
he
says
repeatedly
My
friends
June
and
Neville
Christine
and
Jerzy
were
very
sympathetic
I
was
aware
of
being
surrounded
by
friends
Matter-of-fact
Hugo
Manning
a
night-journalist
who
worked
on
Reuters
and
also
a
poet
and
amateur
philosopher
was
a
great
source
of
moral
support
As
soon
as
I
stopped
taking
dexedrine
the
delusions
of
the
word-game
stopped
But
I
felt
ill
as
I
had
felt
at
Edinburgh
the
previous
year
I
found
a
friend
in
Father
Frank
O'Malley
a
kind
of
lay-psychologist
and
Jungian
He
didn't
think
I
needed
to
go
for
psychiatric
treatment
but
I
saw
him
often
In
the
the
mean
time
Graham
Greene
through
Derek
Stanford
had
offered
to
give
me
a
monthly
sum
of
twenty
pounds
until
I
got
better
He
really
admired
my
work
and
was
enthusiastic
about
helping
me
With
the
cheque
he
would
often
send
a
few
bottles
of
red
wine
as
I
was
happy
to
record
when
speaking
at
Graham's
memorial
service
which
took
the
edge
off
cold
charity
I
took
refuge
first
at
Aylesford
in
Kent
at
the
Carmelite
monastery
and
next
at
nearby
Allington
Castle
near
Maidstone
a
Carmelite
stronghold
of
tertiary
nuns
There
I
rented
a
cottage
in
the
grounds
and
it
was
there
I
put
into
effect
the
determination
I
had
fixed
upon
to
write
a
novel
about
my
recent
brief
but
extremely
intense
word-game
experience
It
so
happened
that
in
in
the
crucial
months
of
my
illness
my
name
was
beginning
to
flourish
in
the
literary
world
It
was
in
a
way
frustrating
that
I
was
unable
to
respond
positively
to
to
so
many
letters
from
publishers
magazines
and
universities
who
were
writing
to
me
then
for
stories
reviews
lectures
One
letter
was
particularly
tempting
It
came
from
Alan
Maclean
the
fiction
editor
of
Macmillan
London
a
much
larger
publisher
than
any
I
had
so
far
dealt
with
Alan
Maclean
who
was
the
best-liked
editor
in
London
asked
me
to
write
a
novel
for
his
firm
they
would
commission
it
a
thing
unheard
of
for
first
novels
in
those
days
Alan
had
been
urged
to
look
for
new
young
talent
and
got
my
address
from
Tony
Strachan
who
was
then
working
at
Macmillan
Feeling
weak
as
I
did
I
replied
that
I
didn't
write
novels
only
stories
Back
came
a
charming
letter
A
book
of
stories
would
be
very
acceptable
Was
I
interested
I
think
I
said
yes
but
I
should
need
time
to
put
a
collection
together
After
I
was
settled
at
Allington
I
began
to
think
how
I
could
go
about
writing
a
novel
and
especially
the
novel
about
my
hallucinations
that
I
had
resolved
to
write
I
didn't
feel
like
a
novelist
and
before
I
could
square
it
with
my
literary
conscience
to
write
a
novel
I
had
to
work
out
a
novel-writing
process
peculiar
to
myself
and
moreover
perform
this
act
within
the
very
novel
I
proposed
to
write
I
felt
too
that
the
novel
as
an
art
form
was
essentially
a
variation
of
a
poem
I
was
convinced
that
any
good
novel
or
indeed
any
composition
which
called
for
a
constructional
sense
was
essentially
an
extension
of
poetry
It
is
always
comforting
to
come
across
a
confirmation
of
one's
private
feelings
in
the
pronouncements
of
others
who
are
more
qualified
to
speak
I
was
particularly
delighted
when
I
came
across
the
following
piece
of
dialogue
in
a
book
of
dialogue-criticism
Invitation
to
Learning
New
York
mainly
by
the
American
scholars
and
writers
Huntington
Cairns
Allen
Tate
soon
to
be
one
of
my
closest
friends
and
Mark
van
Doren
The
magic
piece
of
dialogue
they
are
discussing
Bunyan's
The
Pilgrim's
Progress
goes
thus
Van
Doren
Why
should
he
not
say
that
this
is
trying
to
be
a
poem
too
Any
book
that
is
trying
to
be
good
is
trying
to
be
a
poem
Tate
It
is
a
poem
because
it
deals
with
action
conveyed
through
fictions
of
the
imagination
Van
Doren
This
would
satisfy
Aristotle's
definition
of
a
poem
All
my
hallucinatory
experiences
looking
back
on
them
seemed
to
integrate
with
this
idea
I
always
tell
students
of
my
work
and
interviewers
that
I
think
of
myself
as
predominantly
a
poet
From
the
aspect
of
method
I
could
see
that
to
create
a
character
who
suffered
from
verbal
illusions
on
the
printed
page
would
be
clumsy
So
I
made
my
main
character
hear
a
typewriter
with
voices
composing
the
novel
itself
This
novel
The
Comforters
was
published
in
February
It
was
connected
with
a
very
curious
literary
coincidence
that
in
fact
turned
out
well
in
my
favour
Evelyn
Waugh
was
in
the
year
someone
quite
outside
of
my
orbit
But
it
happened
that
he
too
had
been
taking
the
wrong
sort
of
pills
precisely
in
and
had
suffered
hallucinations
and
had
decided
to
write
a
novel
about
the
experience
In
his
case
as
most
of
his
friends
knew
he
really
did
hear
voices
The
Ordeal
of
Gilbert
Pinfold
was
the
result
published
in
the
summer
of
He
wrote
in
a
letter
Mr
Pinfold's
experiences
were
almost
exactly
my
own
I
heard
voices
such
as
I
describe
almost
continuously
day
and
night
My
novel
was
finished
late
in
But
before
it
was
published
there
was
a
delay
of
a
year
In
the
course
of
that
year
the
proofs
went
round
among
literary
people
one
of
whom
was
Gabriel
Fielding
a
very
good
novelist
his
real
name
was
Alan
Barnsley
a
medical
doctor
practising
in
Maidstone
He
knew
about
my
illness
but
I
believe
he
did
not
know
about
Waugh's
He
was
however
in
touch
with
Waugh
on
some
business
and
in
the
course
of
correspondence
Alan
Barnsley
sent
Evelyn
Waugh
the
proofs
of
my
first
novel
Waugh
replied
that
the
mechanics
of
the
hallucinations
are
well
managed
These
particularly
interested
me
as
I
am
myself
engaged
on
a
similar
subject
To
his
friend
Ann
Fleming
he
wrote
I
have
been
sent
proofs
of
a
very
clever
first
novel
by
a
lady
named
Muriel
Spark
The
theme
is
a
Catholic
novelist
suffering
from
hallucinations
It
will
appear
quite
soon
I
am
sure
people
will
think
it
is
by
me
Please
contradict
such
assertions
On
publication
of
my
novel
Evelyn
Waugh
was
extremely
generous
writing
a
most
interesting
essay
on
it
in
the
Spectator
Recently
I
asked
Evelyn
Waugh's
eldest
son
Auberon
Bron
if
he
remembers
his
father's
reaction
on
getting
those
proofs
of
The
Comforters
while
in
the
middle
of
writing
his
Pinfold
wrote
Bron
in
reply
is
him
singing
the
praises
of
it
and
saying
how
curious
it
was
that
you
should
be
writing
about
the
same
sort
of
experience
at
the
same
time
His
attack
of
course
was
brought
on
by
a
mixture
of
chloral
and
bromide
yours
by
dexedrine
which
should
have
the
opposite
effect
to
chloral
and
bromide
The
sentence
which
jumps
out
from
Evelyn
Waugh's
review
is
surely
It
so
happens
that
The
Comforters
came
to
me
just
as
I
had
finished
a
story
on
a
similar
theme
and
I
was
struck
by
how
much
more
ambitious
was
Miss
Spark's
essay
and
how
much
better
she
had
accomplished
it
In
the
middle
of
before
I
had
finished
my
first
novel
I
moved
back
to
London
fully
restored
and
brimming
with
plans
By
the
end
of
the
year
I
had
a
book
of
short
stories
The
Go-Away
Bird
ready
for
the
publisher
and
early
in
I
started
my
second
novel
Robinson
The
year
was
still
very
difficult
financially
The
long
delay
in
publishing
my
first
novel
was
due
to
Macmillan's
getting
cold
feet
about
it
That
novel
was
thought
to
be
difficult
especially
in
those
days
for
it
is
true
that
one
forms
and
educates
one's
own
public
Readers
of
novels
were
not
yet
used
to
the
likes
of
me
and
some
will
never
be
But
with
Evelyn
Waugh's
first
response
and
those
of
others
who
had
seen
the
proofs
Macmillan
took
courage
My
digs
in
London
were
now
Baldwin
Crescent
Camberwell
in
a
less
fashionable
part
than
in
my
old
Kensington
haunts
I
had
brought
with
me
from
the
country
a
beautiful
half-Persian
stray
cat
Bluebell
about
whom
I
have
written
in
poetry
and
prose
She
was
an
extraordinary
animal
I
loved
her
dearly
Father
O'Malley
and
his
cousin
Teresa
Walshe
had
found
the
place
for
me
The
house
was
owned
by
Mrs
Lazzari
Tiny
a
wonderful
Irish
widow
who
had
been
married
to
an
Italian
cellist
so
I
understand
the
Artist
I
stayed
with
Tiny
for
years
and
years
She
was
then
about
sixty
Right
from
the
start
Tiny
took
me
under
her
wing
encouraged
me
in
my
literary
work
discouraged
the
hangers-on
You're
a
bad
picker
was
her
judgement
of
my
choice
of
men-friends
how
true!
and
fed
me
her
well-cooked
meals
for
a
very
modest
fee
Once
when
I
was
depressed
Tiny
made
me
pack
my
bags
and
accompany
her
home
to
Cork
where
we
received
a
royal
welcome
from
her
daughter
and
their
family
Once
in
a
later
and
more
prosperous
year
when
I
found
Tiny
heaving
a
scuttleful
of
coal
for
her
fire
from
the
cellar
and
noticed
how
tired
she
looked
I
said
Tiny
let's
go
to
Paris
tomorrow
Tiny
put
down
her
coal
Okay
she
said
She
had
never
been
abroad
before
On
that
occasion
while
I
was
seeing
my
agent
Tiny
wandered
off
by
herself
she
came
back
bringing
with
her
for
lunch
my
friend
Joe
McCrindle
owner
and
editor
of
Transatlantic
Review
who
had
visited
at
Baldwin
Crescent
I
bumped
into
Joe
Tiny
said
airily
as
if
the
rue
du
Cherche-Midi
was
somewhere
off
Oxford
Street
While
waiting
for
my
novel
to
appear
I
worked
part
time
at
Peter
Owen
the
publisher
I
liked
the
atmosphere
a
lot
Peter
was
a
young
publisher
who
was
interested
in
books
by
Cocteau
Hermann
Hesse
Cesare
Pavese
It
was
a
joy
to
proof-read
the
translations
of
such
writers
I
was
secretary
proof-reader
editor
publicity
girl
Mrs
Bool
was
secretary
office
manager
and
filing
clerk
and
Erna
Horne
a
rather
myopic
thick-lensed
German
refugee
was
the
book
keeper
We
were
very
attached
to
each
other
there
in
the
office
at
Old
Brompton
Road
with
one
light
bulb
bare
boards
on
the
floor
a
long
table
which
was
the
packing
department
and
Peter
always
retreating
to
his
own
tiny
office
to
take
phone
calls
from
his
uncles
one
of
them
worked
at
Zwemmer
the
booksellers
and
gave
us
intellectual
advice
and
the
other
was
a
psychiatrist
I
worked
at
Peter
Owen's
three
days
a
week
and
at
home
wrote
stories
and
my
second
novel
a
kind
of
adventure

The
Tape
I
began
to
play
the
cards
I
thought
would
win
me
the
game
On
April
I
wrote
to
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecutions
enclosing
copies
of
my
correspondence
with
the
Chief
Constable
included
in
which
was
my
request
to
be
allowed
to
report
directly
to
the
DPP
or
at
least
to
have
regular
right
of
access
to
him
and
to
prepare
interim
reports
for
him
The
following
day
the
DPP
Sir
Barry
Shaw
spoke
to
me
on
the
telephone
and
told
me
that
he
had
no
authority
to
supervise
my
investigation
until
my
request
was
on
his
desk
for
him
to
see
Since
it
related
to
the
enquiry
that
request
had
to
be
sent
through
the
office
of
the
Chief
Constable
so
that
constitutionally
and
legally
he
was
hamstrung
by
the
same
procedures
that
were
frustrating
me
The
Chief
Constable
controlled
completely
the
flow
of
paper
from
me
to
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecutions
Shaw
offered
some
advice
he
suggested
that
I
consider
myself
as
any
person
that
is
not
a
policeman
in
submitting
a
report
to
him
It
was
a
novel
and
interesting
idea
and
I
considered
it
carefully
What
I
was
being
invited
to
consider
was
whether
I
should
regard
myself
in
essence
as
a
self-appointed
private
investigator
I
would
need
to
presume
that
my
team
and
I
were
not
police
officers
or
at
least
not
acting
as
such
I
would
be
engaged
in
a
private
investigation
The
idea
had
some
attractions
but
I
decided
against
it
It
seemed
wrong
somehow
that
a
policeman
brought
in
to
do
a
job
should
have
to
act
as
an
ordinary
member
of
the
public
in
order
to
complete
it
If
I
was
to
succeed
or
fail
I
wished
to
do
so
as
the
Deputy
Chief
Constable
of
Greater
Manchester
and
not
as
an
inquisitive
civilian
I
was
also
worried
about
our
status
as
a
team
in
using
RUC
accommodation
offices
telephones
and
transport
Without
them
we
were
even
more
vulnerable
to
delays
and
worse
On
April
I
again
sent
a
hand-delivered
letter
to
Sir
John
Hermon
It
was
short
and
expressed
my
dismay
at
his
decision
I
asked
him
to
release
me
from
the
requirement
to
report
to
him
and
to
allow
me
to
deal
directly
with
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecutions
both
for
consultancy
and
direction
as
was
the
practice
on
the
mainland
where
this
would
be
commonplace
during
an
investigation
as
serious
as
this
There
was
no
immediate
reply
but
on
May
Philip
Myers
telephoned
me
and
asked
on
behalf
of
Sir
John
Hermon
that
I
go
to
Belfast
on
the
th
for
a
discussion
I
took
the
usual
flight
from
Manchester
Airport
and
arrived
in
the
morning
The
meeting
lasted
for
an
hour
Sir
John
expressed
his
concern
about
what
he
saw
as
the
undesirable
involvement
of
Philip
Myers
as
some
sort
of
self-appointed
intermediary
He
said
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
hidden
agenda
and
he
did
not
like
it
I
told
him
that
Mr
Myers
had
not
in
any
way
compromised
me
or
my
enquiry
and
I
saw
his
political
interest
in
what
was
going
on
as
perfectly
legitimate
He
was
after
all
a
government
adviser
We
then
discussed
the
role
of
the
Deputy
Chief
Constable
Michael
McAtamney
in
the
investigations
that
took
place
before
I
was
called
in
and
the
Chief
Constable
said
that
had
he
been
in
the
country
at
the
time
he
would
have
handled
things
differently
from
the
way
his
deputy
handled
them
I
asked
Sir
John
forcefully
to
reconsider
his
decision
not
to
allow
me
to
have
possession
of
the
Hayshed
tape
he
said
he
would
think
again
about
it
He
was
co-operative
and
apparently
understanding
of
my
determination
to
investigate
the
matter
to
the
best
of
my
abilities
He
said
that
he
was
opposed
to
my
report
being
submitted
to
anyone
other
than
himself
This
would
he
believed
be
unconstitutional
He
asked
for
my
assurances
that
I
would
not
give
any
copies
to
Philip
Myers
or
to
the
DPP
I
said
that
I
could
see
no
harm
in
giving
them
copies
provided
they
did
not
see
those
copies
before
he
did
With
that
his
mood
changed
dramatically
and
he
said
that
I
would
be
quite
wrong
indeed
devious
to
do
so
I
said
there
were
a
number
of
unanswered
questions
that
affected
him
personally
and
undoubtedly
I
would
need
to
see
him
formally
in
due
course
He
asked
me
for
examples
and
I
gave
him
one
only
I
referred
to
a
letter
prepared
for
the
DPP
by
a
Chief
Superintendent
that
recommended
a
charge
of
murder
against
a
police
officer
in
one
of
the
cases
I
had
discovered
that
Sir
John
Hermon
had
disagreed
with
the
analysis
and
findings
of
his
senior
officer
and
had
arbitrarily
overruled
the
recommendation
He
had
then
written
his
own
letter
to
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecutions
an
almost
unheard-of
step
making
out
a
more
emotional
and
political
case
for
not
prosecuting
His
plea
was
discarded
by
the
DPP
who
went
ahead
and
prosecuted
the
policeman
for
murder
as
originally
recommended
I
told
Sir
John
that
as
Chief
Constable
he
had
every
right
to
disagree
with
and
to
overrule
his
Chief
Superintendent
I
did
not
argue
with
that
What
I
found
difficult
to
follow
was
why
he
had
not
forwarded
to
the
DPP
an
analytical
report
written
by
the
Chief
Superintendent
who
is
a
graduate
with
a
law
degree
together
with
his
own
dissenting
recommendation
I
did
not
mention
it
to
him
at
that
time
but
I
had
also
learned
that
in
another
case
when
the
Chief
Superintendent
recommended
no
proceedings
on
a
similar
murder
charge
the
Chief
Constable
had
allowed
the
request
to
go
through
without
any
comment
whatsoever
from
him
I
told
Sir
John
that
I
was
puzzled
at
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
an
unusual
although
not
improper
intervention
by
a
Chief
Constable
in
a
prosecution
and
the
apparent
disposal
of
a
reasoned
report
recommending
that
a
policeman
be
charged
with
murder
I
decided
to
wait
until
the
end
of
my
investigation
into
all
three
incidents
before
I
saw
his
Deputy
and
Sir
John
himself
He
looked
angry
and
resentful
but
said
he
would
be
prepared
to
be
interviewed
by
me
under
criminal
caution
if
necessary
He
seemed
shocked
and
hurt
by
our
conversation
and
asked
what
I
intended
to
do
I
told
him
I
was
desperately
anxious
to
make
progress
after
what
was
now
a
quite
unacceptable
delay
and
I
asked
for
his
co-operation
He
suggested
one
more
meeting
when
he
had
had
time
to
consider
his
position
I
agreed
to
wait
forty-eight
hours
before
I
appealed
again
to
MI5
and
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecutions
but
I
made
it
clear
that
was
as
long
as
I
wished
to
delay
the
decision
That
evening
May
Philip
Myers
phoned
me
at
my
home
and
said
he
was
seeing
Sir
John
Hermon
the
following
day
in
Belfast
I
told
Mr
Myers
I
was
weary
of
delays
and
could
not
allow
matters
to
drift
on
any
more
I
spoke
on
May
to
the
DPP
and
told
him
that
my
meeting
with
Sir
John
had
been
inconclusive
but
that
I
would
be
flying
to
Belfast
again
the
following
day
I
saw
the
Chief
Constable
again
on
May
in
his
office
and
we
continued
our
conversation
He
had
regained
his
composure
and
was
his
usual
powerful
confident
self
He
commenced
briskly
and
uncompromisingly
He
would
not
release
me
from
my
obligation
to
report
directly
to
him
and
he
asked
if
I
suspected
him
of
serious
offences
I
declined
to
answer
in
detail
but
said
that
at
that
moment
my
evidence
against
him
was
of
dubious
practice
and
possible
unprofessionalism
rather
than
criminal
activity
I
did
not
however
rule
out
the
latter
He
then
surprised
me
entirely
by
saying
that
he
as
Chief
Constable
now
agreed
without
any
preconditions
whatsoever
to
release
to
me
the
tape
of
the
activities
at
the
Hayshed
together
with
all
documents
and
also
the
authority
to
ask
all
the
questions
I
needed
of
the
police
officers
monitoring
the
tape
He
added
that
MI5
had
the
most
powerful
interest
in
the
tape
and
that
they
would
need
to
be
assured
of
the
way
I
handled
it
I
was
beginning
to
hear
the
same
dizzying
arguments
I
thought
were
behind
me
I
told
Sir
John
that
MI5
had
already
given
me
full
authority
at
the
highest
legal
level
to
hear
the
tape
All
that
now
remained
to
be
done
was
to
hand
it
to
me
Sir
John
then
said
No
tape
may
exist
you
appreciate
that
of
course
I
said
I
did
not
appreciate
it
although
his
Assistant
Chief
Constable
and
head
of
Special
Branch
had
already
hinted
at
it
Sir
John
suggested
I
speak
to
MI5
officers
but
he
refused
to
elaborate
further
I
was
equally
determined
to
pin
the
Chief
Constable
down
to
his
apparently
unequivocal
promise
to
me
of
a
few
minutes
earlier
I
wanted
that
tape
I
said
I
could
not
tolerate
any
further
delays
and
I
would
not
leave
his
headquarters
without
some
firm
date
for
my
access
to
the
tape
and
the
policemen
who
had
heard
it
Sir
John
paused
looked
at
me
hard
and
then
without
speaking
made
a
telephone
call
About
fifteen
minutes
later
a
man
joined
us
whose
name
I
know
but
who
was
introduced
to
me
simply
as
a
member
of
MI5
based
in
Belfast
Sir
John's
mood
had
changed
again
and
I
was
brusquely
asked
by
him
to
leave
his
office
which
I
reluctantly
did
I
cooled
my
temper
by
walking
around
the
grounds
About
fifteen
minutes
later
I
resumed
my
conversation
with
the
two
of
them
and
the
MI5
officer
told
me
that
the
way
was
now
open
for
me
to
make
progress
He
would
speak
he
said
to
his
senior
directors
in
London
and
I
could
look
forward
to
complete
co-operation
subject
to
unspecified
safeguards
Before
I
left
I
asked
Sir
John
for
his
decision
on
my
request
to
see
the
informant
He
angrily
refused
and
would
not
discuss
the
matter
further
I
said
that
I
had
to
accept
his
see
the
informant's
policeman
handler
He
was
non-committal
I
told
the
Chief
Constable
and
the
MI5
officer
that
my
patience
was
exhausted
The
following
day
Sir
John
Hermon
telephoned
me
to
tell
me
that
the
way
was
now
clear
for
me
to
deal
directly
with
MI5
to
obtain
the
information
I
was
seeking
about
the
tape
I
realized
then
that
the
labyrinthine
processes
through
which
I
had
been
groping
had
brought
me
back
to
exactly
where
I
had
been
five
months
earlier
in
January
It
was
obvious
to
me
that
much
midnight
oil
had
been
burned
The
Belfast
MI5
officer
told
me
that
the
Chief
Constable
had
suggested
that
MI5's
role
be
to
act
as
honest
brokers
between
the
RUC
and
myself
He
wished
them
to
examine
and
no
doubt
assess
the
contents
of
the
tape
before
it
was
passed
to
me
I
told
the
MI5
officer
I
would
not
accept
this
I
was
the
investigator
and
I
would
decide
on
the
value
of
the
evidence
I
could
not
agree
to
judgments
being
made
other
than
by
the
Director
of
Public
Prosecutions
who
was
expecting
me
to
obtain
all
the
evidence
I
could
to
help
him
in
that
task
I
said
that
despite
all
the
promises
it
seemed
that
I
would
have
to
begin
again
with
the
Chief
Constable
Within
the
hour
Sir
John
Hermon
telephoned
me
and
said
that
he
wished
me
to
have
access
to
all
the
information
and
he
had
merely
asked
MI5
to
look
at
it
first
to
see
whether
they
had
any
objections
to
any
specific
part
of
it
being
given
to
me
He
was
not
keeping
anything
back
he
said
If
I
were
denied
access
to
evidence
then
that
would
be
because
MI5
thought
it
desirable
not
he
I
contained
my
rising
temper
and
told
him
that
MI5
had
agreed
to
my
having
the
tape
without
any
argument
and
without
conditions
He
was
in
my
view
clouding
the
issue
I
insisted
that
he
speak
to
MI5
again
and
give
me
by
the
following
week
a
firm
answer
and
details
of
where
and
when
I
could
take
possession
of
the
tape
I
asked
him
to
deal
with
the
matter
personally
and
told
him
that
if
there
were
any
further
obstructions
I
would
seriously
consider
whether
I
could
continue
to
undertake
the
investigation
on
his
behalf

THE
VIEWS
OF
THE
CABINET
I
could
of
course
have
concentrated
my
efforts
for
the
second
ballot
on
winning
over
the
back-benchers
directly
Perhaps
I
should
have
done
But
the
earlier
meetings
had
persuaded
me
that
it
was
essential
to
mobilise
Cabinet
ministers
not
just
to
give
formal
support
but
also
to
go
out
and
persuade
junior
ministers
and
back-benchers
to
back
me
In
asking
for
their
support
however
I
was
also
putting
myself
at
their
mercy
If
a
substantial
number
of
Cabinet
colleagues
refused
their
backing
there
could
be
no
disguising
the
fact
afterwards
I
recalled
a
complaint
from
Churchill
then
Prime
Minister
to
his
Chief
Whip
that
talk
of
his
resignation
in
the
Parliamentary
Party
he
would
shortly
be
succeeded
by
Anthony
Eden
was
undermining
his
authority
Without
that
authority
he
could
not
be
an
effective
prime
minister
Similarly
a
prime
minister
who
knows
that
his
or
her
Cabinet
has
withheld
its
support
is
fatally
weakened
I
knew
and
I
am
sure
they
knew-
that
I
would
not
willingly
remain
an
hour
in
Downing
Street
without
real
authority
to
govern
As
I
have
said
I
had
spoken
to
Douglas
Hurd
and
John
Major
already
though
I
had
not
directly
sought
their
views
about
what
I
should
do
I
had
already
seen
Cecil
Parkinson
after
returning
from
the
tea-room
He
told
me
that
I
should
remain
in
the
race
that
I
could
count
on
his
unequivocal
support
and
that
it
would
be
a
hard
struggle
but
that
I
could
win
Nick
Ridley
no
longer
in
the
Cabinet
but
a
figure
of
more
than
equivalent
weight
also
assured
me
of
his
complete
support
Ken
Baker
had
made
clear
his
total
commitment
to
me
The
Lord
Chancellor
and
Lord
Belstead
Leader
of
the
Lords
were
not
really
significant
players
in
the
game
And
John
Wakeham
was
my
campaign
manager
But
all
the
others
I
would
see
in
my
room
in
the
House
of
Commons
Over
the
next
two
hours
or
so
each
Cabinet
minister
came
in
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
front
of
me
and
gave
me
his
views
Almost
to
a
man
they
used
the
same
formula
This
was
that
they
themselves
would
back
me
of
course
but
that
regretfully
they
did
not
believe
I
could
win
In
fact
as
I
well
realised
they
had
been
feverishly
discussing
what
they
should
say
in
the
rooms
off
the
Commons
Cabinet
corridor
above
my
room
Like
all
politicians
in
a
quandary
they
had
sorted
out
their
line
to
take
and
they
would
cling
to
it
through
thick
and
thin
After
three
or
four
interviews
I
felt
I
could
almost
join
in
the
chorus
Whatever
the
monotony
of
the
song
however
the
tone
and
human
reactions
of
those
who
came
into
my
room
that
evening
offered
dramatic
contrasts
My
first
ministerial
visitor
was
not
a
member
of
the
Cabinet
at
all
Francis
Maude
Angus's
son
and
Minister
of
State
at
the
Foreign
Office
whom
I
regarded
as
a
reliable
ally
told
me
that
he
passionately
supported
the
things
I
believed
in
that
he
would
back
me
as
long
as
I
went
on
but
that
he
did
not
believe
I
could
win
He
left
in
a
state
of
some
distress
nor
had
he
cheered
me
up
noticeably
Ken
Clarke
now
entered
His
manner
was
robust
in
the
brutalist
style
he
has
cultivated
the
candid
friend
He
said
that
this
method
of
changing
prime
ministers
was
farcical
and
that
he
personally
would
be
happy
to
support
me
for
another
five
or
ten
years
Most
of
the
Cabinet
however
thought
that
I
should
stand
down
Otherwise
not
only
would
I
lose
I
would
lose
big
If
that
were
to
happen
the
Party
would
go
to
Michael
Heseltine
and
end
up
split
So
Douglas
and
John
should
be
released
from
their
obligation
to
me
and
allowed
to
stand
since
either
had
a
better
chance
than
I
did
Then
the
solid
part
of
the
Party
could
get
back
together
Contrary
to
persistent
rumours
Ken
Clarke
at
no
point
threatened
to
resign
Peter
Lilley
obviously
ill
at
ease
came
in
next
From
the
message
I
had
received
in
Paris
I
knew
roughly
what
to
expect
from
him
He
duly
announced
that
he
would
support
me
if
I
stood
but
that
it
was
inconceivable
that
I
would
win
Michael
Heseltine
must
not
be
allowed
to
get
the
leadership
or
all
my
achievements
would
be
threatened
The
only
way
to
prevent
this
was
to
make
way
for
John
Major
Of
course
I
had
not
been
optimistic
about
Ken
Clarke
and
Peter
Lilley
for
quite
different
reasons
But
I
had
written
off
my
next
visitor
Malcolm
Rifkind
in
advance
After
Geoffrey's
departure
Malcolm
was
probably
my
sharpest
personal
critic
in
the
Cabinet
and
he
did
not
soften
his
criticism
on
this
occasion
He
said
bluntly
that
I
could
not
win
and
that
either
John
or
Douglas
would
do
better
Still
even
Malcolm
did
not
declare
against
me
When
I
asked
him
whether
I
would
have
his
support
if
I
did
stand
he
said
that
he
would
have
to
think
about
it
Indeed
he
gave
the
assurance
that
he
would
never
campaign
against
me
Silently
I
thanked
God
for
small
mercies
After
so
much
commiseration
it
was
a
relief
to
talk
to
Peter
Brooke
He
was
as
always
charming
thoughtful
and
loyal
He
said
he
would
fully
support
me
whatever
I
chose
to
do
Being
in
Northern
Ireland
he
was
not
closely
in
touch
with
parliamentary
opinion
and
could
not
himself
offer
an
authoritative
view
of
my
prospects
But
he
believed
I
could
win
if
I
went
ahead
with
all
guns
blazing
Could
I
win
if
all
guns
did
not
blaze
That
was
something
I
was
myself
beginning
to
doubt
My
next
visitor
was
Michael
Howard
another
rising
star
who
shared
my
convictions
Michael's
version
of
the
Cabinet
theme
was
altogether
stronger
and
more
encouraging
Although
he
doubted
my
prospects
he
himself
would
not
only
support
me
but
would
campaign
vigorously
for
me
William
Waldegrave
my
most
recent
Cabinet
appointment
arrived
next
William
was
very
formal
I
could
hardly
expect
more
from
someone
who
did
not
share
my
political
views
But
he
declared
very
straightforwardly
that
it
would
be
dishonourable
for
someone
to
accept
a
place
in
my
Cabinet
one
week
and
not
support
me
three
weeks
later
He
would
vote
for
me
as
long
as
I
was
a
candidate
But
he
had
a
sense
of
foreboding
about
the
result
It
would
be
a
catastrophe
if
corporatist
policies
took
over
which
of
course
was
another
way
of
saying
that
Michael
Heseltine
should
be
held
at
bay
At
this
point
I
received
a
note
from
John
Wakeham
who
wanted
an
urgent
word
with
me
Apparently
the
position
was
much
worse
than
he
had
thought
I
was
not
surprised
It
was
hardly
any
better
from
where
I
was
sitting
John
Gummer
bounced
in
next
His
position
was
on
the
face
of
it
not
easy
to
predict
He
was
a
passionate
European
but
he
apparently
shared
the
same
general
philosophy
of
government
as
I
did
In
fact
I
was
mildly
curious
as
to
how
he
would
resolve
this
tension
But
he
reeled
off
the
standard
formula
that
he
would
support
me
if
I
decided
to
stand
but
as
a
friend
he
should
warn
me
that
I
could
not
win
and
so
I
should
move
aside
and
let
John
and
Douglas
stand
John
Gummer
was
followed
by
Chris
Patten
Chris
and
I
had
worked
together
for
many
years
from
the
time
when
he
was
Director
of
the
Conservative
Research
Department
until
I
brought
him
into
the
Cabinet
in
He
had
a
way
with
words
and
perhaps
this
had
too
easily
convinced
me
that
he
and
I
always
put
the
same
construction
upon
them
But
he
was
a
man
of
the
Left
So
I
could
hardly
complain
when
he
told
me
that
he
would
support
me
but
that
I
could
not
win
and
so
on
Even
melodramas
have
intervals
even
Macbeth
has
the
porter's
scene
I
now
had
a
short
talk
with
Alan
Clark
Minister
of
State
at
the
Ministry
of
Defence
and
a
gallant
friend
who
came
round
to
lift
my
spirits
with
the
encouraging
advice
that
I
should
fight
on
at
all
costs
Unfortunately
he
went
on
to
argue
that
I
should
fight
on
even
though
I
was
bound
to
lose
because
it
was
better
to
go
out
in
a
blaze
of
glorious
defeat
than
to
go
gentle
into
that
good
night
Since
I
had
no
particular
fondness
for
Wagnerian
endings
this
lifted
my
spirits
only
briefly
But
I
was
glad
to
have
someone
unambiguously
on
my
side
even
in
defeat
By
now
John
Wakeham
and
Ken
Baker
had
turned
up
to
speak
to
me
and
their
news
was
not
good
John
said
that
he
now
doubted
whether
I
could
get
the
support
of
the
Cabinet
What
I
had
been
hearing
did
not
suggest
that
he
was
wrong
He
added
that
he
had
tried
to
put
together
a
campaign
team
but
was
not
succeeding
even
at
that
I
had
realised
by
now
that
I
was
not
dealing
with
Polish
cavalrymen
but
I
was
surprised
that
neither
Tristan
Garel-Jones
nor
Richard
Ryder
were
prepared
to
serve
as
John's
lieutenants
because
they
believed
I
could
not
win
Tristan
Garel-Jones
had
of
course
served
on
my
campaign
team
the
previous
year
when
my
position
was
not
seriously
under
threat
Nonetheless
I
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
be
really
disappointed
in
him
now
His
view
of
Conservative
politics
had
always
been
that
the
line
of
least
resistance
is
the
best
course
and
I
suppose
he
was
only
being
consistent
But
it
was
a
personal
as
well
as
a
political
blow
to
learn
that
Richard
who
had
come
with
me
to
No
all
those
years
ago
as
my
political
secretary
and
whom
I
had
moved
up
the
ladder
as
quickly
as
I
decently
could
was
deserting
at
the
first
whiff
of
grapeshot
Ken
Baker
went
on
to
report
that
the
position
had
deteriorated
since
we
had
spoken
that
morning
He
had
found
between
ten
and
twelve
members
of
the
Cabinet
who
did
not
think
I
could
win
And
if
they
thought
that
there
would
not
be
enough
enthusiasm
to
carry
the
day
Even
so
he
believed
that
I
should
carry
on
But
he
floated
Tom
King's
suggestion
which
I
was
myself
to
hear
from
Tom
a
little
later
that
I
should
promise
to
stand
down
after
Christmas
if
I
won
The
idea
was
that
this
would
allow
me
to
see
through
the
Gulf
War
I
could
not
accept
this
I
would
have
no
authority
in
the
meantime
and
I
would
need
all
I
could
muster
for
the
forthcoming
battles
in
the
European
Community
After
John
and
Ken
had
left
Norman
Lamont
came
in
and
repeated
the
formula
The
position
he
said
was
beyond
repair
Everything
we
had
achieved
on
industry
and
Europe
would
be
jeopardised
by
victory
for
Michael
Heseltine
Everything
but
Robertson
Hare's
Oh
Calamity
John
MacGregor
now
appeared
and
somewhat
belatedly
gave
me
the
news
that
I
lacked
support
in
the
Cabinet
which
he
had
felt
unable
to
convey
to
me
earlier
in
the
day
He
too
eschewed
any
originality
and
stuck
by
the
formula
Tom
King
said
the
usual
things
though
more
warmly
than
most
He
added
the
suggestion
trailed
by
Ken
Baker
that
I
should
offer
to
stand
down
at
a
specific
date
in
the
future
I
rejected
this
suggestion
but
I
was
grateful
for
the
diversion
In
all
the
circumtances
it
was
a
relief
to
see
David
Waddington
enter
and
sit
down
on
the
sofa
Here
was
a
steadfast
friend
but
as
I
quickly
saw
one
in
the
deepest
distress
All
David's
instincts
were
to
fight
on
For
him
the
argument
that
battle
should
not
be
joined
because
defeat
was
likely
had
none
of
the
attraction
that
it
did
for
some
of
his
colleagues
It
was
not
an
evasion
nor
a
disguised
threat
nor
a
way
of
abandoning
my
cause
without
admitting
the
fact
It
was
a
reluctant
recognition
of
reality
But
as
a
former
Chief
Whip
and
how
often
in
recent
days
had
I
wished
that
he
still
held
that
office
he
knew
that
support
for
me
in
the
Cabinet
had
collapsed
David
said
that
he
wanted
me
to
win
and
would
support
me
but
could
not
guarantee
a
victory
He
left
my
room
with
tears
in
his
eyes
The
last
meeting
was
with
Tony
Newton
who
though
clearly
nervous
just
about
managed
to
get
out
the
agreed
line
He
did
not
think
I
could
win
etc
etc
Nor
by
now
did
I
John
Wakeham
came
in
again
and
elaborated
further
on
what
he
had
earlier
told
me
I
had
lost
the
Cabinet's
support
I
could
not
even
muster
a
credible
campaign
team
It
was
the
end
I
was
sick
at
heart
I
could
have
resisted
the
opposition
of
opponents
and
potential
rivals
and
even
respected
them
for
it
but
what
grieved
me
was
the
desertion
of
those
I
had
always
considered
friends
and
allies
and
the
weasel
words
whereby
they
had
transmuted
their
betrayal
into
frank
advice
and
concern
for
my
fate
I
dictated
a
brief
statement
of
my
resignation
to
be
read
out
at
Cabinet
the
following
morning
But
I
said
that
I
would
return
to
No
to
talk
to
Denis
before
finally
taking
my
decision
I
was
preparing
to
return
when
Norman
Tebbit
arrived
with
Michael
Portillo
Michael
was
Minister
of
State
at
the
DoE
with
responsibility
for
local
government
and
the
community
charge
He
was
beyond
any
questioning
a
passionate
supporter
of
everything
we
stood
for
He
tried
to
convince
me
that
the
Cabinet
were
misreading
the
situation
that
I
was
being
misled
and
that
with
a
vigorous
campaign
it
would
still
be
possible
to
turn
things
round
With
even
a
drop
of
this
spirit
in
higher
places
it
might
indeed
have
been
possible
But
that
was
just
not
there
Then
another
group
of
loyalists
from
the
Group
of
MPs
arrived
in
my
room
George
Gardiner
John
Townend
Edward
Leigh
Chris
Chope
and
a
number
of
others
They
had
a
similar
message
to
Michael
I
was
immensely
grateful
for
their
support
and
warmth
and
said
that
I
would
think
about
what
to
do
Then
at
last
I
returned
to
No

unknown
Schoolmaster
Larchfield
Academy
was
a
small
private
school
for
boys
which
had
seen
better
days
Its
old
pupils
included
John
Logie
Baird
the
inventor
of
television
and
Sir
James
Frazer
author
of
The
Golden
Bough
But
by
the
school
was
not
prospering
Until
recently
it
had
taken
boys
up
to
the
age
of
eighteen
but
it
could
no
longer
compete
with
larger
and
more
celebrated
public
schools
and
now
it
did
not
attempt
to
be
more
than
a
preparatory
establishment
catering
for
boys
between
six
and
thirteen
with
just
a
few
older
pupils
The
forty
or
so
boys
were
taught
in
bleak
old-fashioned
buildings
lit
by
gas
jets
and
the
headmaster
an
elderly
dispirited
man
named
Perkins
with
a
drooping
moustache
had
largely
given
up
the
struggle
Besides
the
headmaster
himself
who
taught
classics
there
were
four
members
of
the
staff
Mr
Sinkinson
the
mathematics
master
Miss
Ensor
Miss
Greenhalge
and
Auden
himself
whose
task
was
to
teach
English
and
French
He
also
had
to
take
turns
of
duty
supervising
the
dozen
or
so
boys
who
were
boarders
the
rest
being
day
pupils
who
lived
at
home
and
refereeing
games
He
soon
settled
in
Schoolmastering
suits
me
I
thoroughly
enjoy
it
he
wrote
to
his
brother
John
who
was
working
as
a
geologist
in
India
If
you
get
bored
with
India
why
not
try
it
I
find
myself
quite
enjoying
cricket
Perhaps
I
shall
find
Rugger
the
same
but
I
wish
I
knew
the
rules
And
in
a
birthday
verse-letter
to
Gabriel
Carritt
he
wrote
Now
I'm
up
here
Paid
to
teach
English
to
the
sons
of
Scotsmen
Poor
little
buggers
His
predecessor
in
the
job
Day-Lewis
had
found
his
pupils
Glaswegian
accents
difficult
to
get
used
to
and
presumably
Auden
experienced
the
same
problem
But
he
discovered
he
had
a
real
liking
for
the
business
of
teaching
He
enjoyed
the
boys
company
Twelve
year
old
boys
are
the
best
people
to
talk
to
he
remarked
to
a
friend
and
he
was
sympathetic
to
the
rebels
in
the
school
having
been
rebellious
in
his
own
schooldays
Above
all
he
liked
influencing
his
pupils
and
telling
them
what
they
should
do
with
their
lives
The
job
of
teacher
in
fact
gave
a
proper
outlet
to
two
dominant
aspects
of
his
personality
the
dogmatic
schoolmaster
and
the
would-be
healer
The
boys
on
the
other
hand
did
not
find
him
the
ideal
teacher
We
were
rather
over-awed
by
W
H
A
and
could
not
quite
get
the
measure
of
him
recalled
one
of
them
Norman
Wright
Born
in
Helensburgh
of
two
Scottish
parents
this
was
my
first
encounter
with
an
Englishman
and
I
was
not
greatly
impressed
I
could
follow
only
with
some
difficulty
his
pronunciation
and
frankly
his
reasoning
was
beyond
me
I
believe
he
was
the
first
adult
I
had
met
who
bit
his
nails
and
smoked
heavily
I
did
not
admire
the
habits
He
seemed
rather
aloof
and
not
very
companionable
Not
a
person
in
whom
we
would
confide
He
did
accompany
us
to
games
but
his
appearance
on
the
rugby
pitch
was
a
bit
of
a
giggle
He
wasn't
endowed
for
such
sport
It
was
perhaps
because
he
lacked
a
real
rapport
with
the
boys
that
Auden
kept
order
in
class
partly
by
means
of
clowning
Margaret
Gardiner
who
visited
him
at
Larchfield
noted
this
He
told
me
that
he
believed
teachers
ought
to
be
clowns
if
you
stood
on
your
head
or
played
the
piano
with
your
feet
the
boys
would
immediately
attend
there'd
be
no
difficulty
about
discipline
You
should
continuously
startle
them
into
interest
he
said
keep
them
alert
by
letting
them
catch
you
out
trip
you
up
One
of
his
tricks
was
teaching
the
boys
to
stick
stamps
on
the
ceiling
by
flicking
them
up
on
pennies
On
another
occasion
when
he
had
trouble
with
discipline
he
told
Gabriel
Carritt
he
had
threatened
to
cut
my
prick
off
if
the
boys
continued
to
fool
about
He
bought
a
suitable
piece
of
meat
from
the
butcher
and
next
time
a
hullabaloo
broke
out
in
class
opened
his
fly
brought
out
this
meat
and
appeared
to
be
actually
carrying
out
the
threat
with
a
sharp
knife
to
horrified
cries
of
No
sir!
Don't
do
it!
The
school
was
situated
in
the
middle
of
Helensburgh
a
modest-sized
market
town
that
served
largely
as
a
dormitory
for
Glasgow
businessmen
who
could
be
seen
every
morning
hurrying
to
catch
their
train
The
town
itself
was
rather
smugly
middle-class
Day-Lewis
called
it
this
Wimbledon
of
the
North
but
it
was
surrounded
by
fine
scenery
Loch
Lomond
and
Glen
Fruin
lay
only
a
few
miles
away
while
across
the
Clyde
the
lights
of
Greenock
glimmered
alluringly
at
night
Auden
dubbed
it
the
wicked
city
Glimpses
of
these
scenes
began
to
appear
in
Auden's
poetry
but
he
took
no
particular
interest
in
the
area
nor
in
Scotland
on
a
wider
scale
I
don't
think
any
of
the
Scottish
nationalists
are
any
use
he
wrote
to
Naomi
Mitchison
adding
that
he
thought
the
Scottish
poet
Hugh
MacDiarmid
such
a
fearful
intellectual
snob
and
prig
and
suggesting
that
nationalism
merely
amounted
to
saying
that
Compton
Mackenzie
will
be
king
one
day
His
attention
was
caught
more
by
the
visible
signs
of
the
economic
depression
from
which
the
whole
of
Britain
was
now
suffering
for
on
a
train
journey
into
Glasgow
he
could
see
the
Clydebank
shipyards
lying
idle
and
silent
as
well
as
the
poverty-ridden
slums
of
Glasgow
itself
Much
the
same
thing
was
to
be
seen
in
Birmingham
his
home
town
and
on
Easter
Day
just
before
travelling
to
Helensburgh
to
begin
his
teaching
job
he
wrote
a
poem
which
must
have
grown
partly
out
of
what
he
had
observed
there
Get
there
if
you
can
and
see
the
land
you
once
were
proud
to
own
Though
the
roads
have
almost
vanished
and
the
expresses
never
run
Smokeless
chimneys
damaged
bridges
rotting
wharves
and
choked
canals
Tramlines
buckled
smashed
trucks
lying
on
their
side
across
the
rails
Power-stations
locked
deserted
since
they
drew
the
boiler
fires
Pylons
falling
or
subsiding
trailing
dead
high-tension
wires
Head-gears
gaunt
on
grass-grown
pit-banks
seams
abandoned
years
ago
Drop
a
stone
and
listen
for
its
splash
In
flooded
dark
below
There
is
of
course
a
lot
of
exaggeration
in
this
or
at
least
there
would
be
if
it
were
meant
to
be
a
picture
of
Britain
in
the
grip
of
the
Depression
In
fact
the
poem
owes
a
lot
to
Auden's
private
landscape
of
abandoned
lead
mines
and
soon
reveals
itself
as
not
really
concerned
with
the
present
state
of
the
country
but
with
the
defective
emotional
condition
of
the
middle-class
intellectual
for
which
the
ruined
industrial
landscape
is
a
symbol
It
is
yet
another
reworking
of
what
Auden
had
learnt
from
John
Layard
But
the
fact
that
the
psychological
theme
is
now
presented
in
terms
of
the
plight
of
a
nation
suggests
that
Auden
was
becoming
aware
for
the
first
time
of
the
value
of
politics
for
his
poetry
It
was
he
said
himself
during
this
year
that
he
began
to
read
newspapers
At
about
the
time
he
began
teaching
at
Larchfield
Faber
Faber
accepted
a
volume
of
his
poetry
for
publication
Auden
may
have
submitted
a
book
of
his
poetry
to
another
London
publisher
Victor
Gollancz
some
time
around
this
may
have
been
the
same
collection
of
poems
that
was
accepted
by
Faber
the
next
year
Sheila
Hodges
in
Gollancz
The
Story
of
a
Publishing
House
writes
Jon
Evans
full-time
reader
with
the
firm
tried
very
hard
to
persuade
Victor
to
take
on
Auden
but
without
success
p
The
book
was
to
include
several
of
the
poems
that
Stephen
Spender
had
printed
in
as
well
as
others
that
Auden
had
written
since
then
nothing
remained
of
the
selection
that
Faber's
had
turned
down
in
A
large
number
of
the
poems
in
the
book
perhaps
the
majority
dealt
under
a
layer
of
symbolism
with
the
emotional
plight
of
the
individual
expressed
largely
according
to
Layard's
ideas
but
this
would
scarcely
have
been
apparent
to
someone
who
did
not
know
Auden's
private
interests
The
really
striking
thing
about
the
book
was
the
range
of
images
and
styles
poems
in
the
manner
of
schoolboy
rhymes
and
cabaret
songs
were
set
next
to
pieces
imitating
Laura
Riding
or
Anglo-Saxon
verse
and
the
almost
clinical
Hardy-like
detachment
with
which
Auden
looked
at
his
subject-matter
as
if
from
a
great
height
Consider
this
and
in
our
time
As
the
hawk
sees
it
or
the
helmeted
airman
Auden's
book
which
was
to
be
called
simply
Poems
was
accepted
on
behalf
of
Faber's
by
T
S
Eliot
When
Auden
was
in
London
he
met
Eliot
and
was
as
impressed
by
him
as
a
man
as
he
had
been
by
his
poetry
So
long
as
one
was
in
Eliot's
presence
he
said
after
Eliot's
death
in
one
felt
it
was
impossible
to
say
or
do
anything
base
Auden
had
the
experience
some
time
in
the
early
s
of
being
invited
to
dinner
by
Eliot
and
his
first
wife
Vivien
of
whose
strangeness
he
was
made
aware
on
arrival
I
told
Mrs
T
S
E
that
I
was
glad
to
be
there
and
she
said
Well
Tom's
not
glad
Tribute
p
Rather
late
in
the
day
when
Auden's
Poems
were
already
in
proof
Eliot
agreed
to
add
Paid
on
Both
Sides
to
the
book
it
had
already
been
printed
by
him
in
the
Criterion
He
also
commissioned
Auden
to
write
for
the
Criterion
his
first
published
book
review
The
review
was
of
Instinct
and
Intuition
A
Study
in
Mental
Duality
by
G
H
Dibblee
and
it
shows
that
Auden
was
now
tentatively
beginning
to
move
away
from
John
Layard's
view
of
personality
as
a
set
of
unconscious
instinctive
desires
controlled
and
inhibited
by
the
conscious
reasoning
mind
Auden
reviewing
Dibblee's
book
now
wrote
The
reason
is
an
instrument
and
cannot
of
itself
control
or
inhibit
anything
what
it
can
do
is
to
cause
one
desire
to
modify
another
Auden
began
to
undertake
more
book
reviews
for
the
Criterion
and
for
other
journals
such
as
F
R
Leavis's
Scrutiny
Leavis
had
not
yet
turned
against
Auden
The
Listener
the
New
Statesman
and
Geoffrey
Grigson's
New
Verse
His
aims
as
a
critic
were
ostensibly
simple
to
praise
the
praiseworthy
and
to
give
examples
from
the
book
under
review
in
the
form
of
quotations
as
lengthy
as
the
space
would
permit
He
said
of
this
that
to
arouse
interest
the
critic
must
quote
with
as
little
comment
as
possible
He
implied
that
he
had
learnt
this
from
Eliot
whose
critical
writing
did
not
in
itself
especially
influence
him
I
have
never
understood
exactly
what
the
objective
correlative
is
he
admitted
but
whose
gift
for
illustrating
his
essays
with
surprising
quotations
he
found
instructive
Auden
did
not
usually
write
reviews
of
books
he
thought
were
poor
He
said
that
a
critic
should
keep
silent
about
works
which
he
believes
to
be
bad
while
at
the
same
time
vigorously
campaigning
for
those
which
he
believes
to
be
good
On
another
occasion
he
wrote
Make
it
a
rule
not
to
review
any
book
which
whatever
its
faults
you
don't
basically
like
He
did
however
late
in
his
life
once
dismiss
a
book
which
he
was
reviewing
as
an
unbook
written
it
would
seem
by
an
anal
madman
He
also
declared
that
critics
should
not
tell
readers
what
to
think
about
particular
books
The
one
thing
I
most
emphatically
do
not
ask
of
a
critic
is
that
he
tells
me
what
I
ought
to
approve
of
or
condemn
Yet
he
often
violated
this
rule
demanding
for
example
that
parents
should
make
their
children
read
Grimm's
fairly
tales
and
in
the
mid
s
declaring
that
how
a
reader
reacted
to
Tolkien's
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
which
he
himself
greatly
admired
was
a
test
of
literary
taste
He
also
often
used
his
reviews
as
testing-grounds
for
his
own
changing
opinions
and
as
a
chance
to
conduct
a
debate
with
himself
for
example
his
piece
about
Dibblee's
book
becomes
an
argument
about
D
H
Lawrence
This
gave
his
reviews
an
intensity
and
excitement
but
it
could
be
disconcerting
to
the
reader
especially
as
during
the
s
Auden
had
not
found
a
satisfactory
prose
style
and
was
sometimes
very
obtuse
in
his
way
of
expressing
things

A
week
after
the
election
Tony
Benn
had
his
opportunity
to
prove
his
worth
to
his
new
constituency
Chesterfield
people
who
had
any
doubts
that
Benn
was
anything
more
than
a
media
politician
learned
differently
in
the
following
year
of
crippling
hardship
for
the
miners
during
which
Benn
as
NUM
official
John
Burrows
said
was
always
there
at
your
shoulder
when
you
needed
him
geeing
the
lads
up
He
was
our
closest
ally
on
the
picket
line
I
couldn't
speak
too
highly
of
him
IV
John
Burrows
March
The
strike
was
sparked
by
the
convergence
of
a
number
of
issues
not
least
the
need
for
Margaret
Thatcher
to
prove
she
could
succeed
where
Heath
had
failed
This
personal
consideration
only
gave
the
issue
more
spice
however
for
the
deep
and
underlying
reason
was
a
genuine
conviction
among
hard-line
monetarist
Tories
that
Britain's
fortunes
could
not
be
reversed
until
the
government
had
dealt
with
the
unions
It
would
be
called
class
war
by
the
left
and
sound
management
by
the
right
but
the
effect
was
the
same
Beating
the
rest
of
the
unions
but
leaving
the
miners
intact
would
be
cowardly
and
ineffective
The
miners
were
the
backbone
of
the
trade
union
movement
if
they
could
be
brought
down
the
battle
was
won
The
conflict
was
not
entered
into
without
thought
and
careful
planning
In
February
extra
state
money
was
quickly
found
to
avert
a
miners
strike
over
pit
closures
the
very
issue
over
which
the
strike
was
fought
The
time
was
not
right
At
this
stage
only
James
Prior's
Trade
Union
Act
was
in
place
This
contributed
to
union
democracy
by
permitting
public
money
to
be
used
for
strike
and
leadership
ballots
made
closed
shop
agreements
far
more
difficult
and
outlawed
secondary
picketing
That
was
not
enough
to
beat
the
miners
Norman
Tebbit's
Act
was
the
key
this
took
away
the
immunity
of
trade
unions
for
financial
loss
caused
by
a
strike
Now
unions
could
be
fined
heavily
for
conducting
unlawful
strikes
While
both
sides
expected
a
battle
over
closures
the
strike
actually
came
about
through
a
foolish
National
Coal
Board
decision
taken
at
local
level
to
close
Cortonwood
pit
in
South
Yorkshire
This
led
the
National
Union
of
Mineworkers
to
put
into
action
a
contingency
plan
which
had
previously
been
agreed
at
their
conference
that
a
national
strike
should
be
called
to
prevent
a
pit-closure
scheme
The
failure
to
call
a
national
strike
ballot
lost
the
miners
leadership
a
great
deal
of
support
including
that
of
Neil
Kinnock
and
others
in
the
Labour
leadership
and
gave
a
justification
for
those
miners
particularly
in
Nottinghamshire
who
did
not
wish
to
strike
It
could
be
argued
that
the
Labour
leadership
would
have
given
scant
support
whatever
the
circumstances
and
that
Nottinghamshire
would
have
disobeyed
even
an
instruction
based
on
a
national
strike
ballot
but
the
task
of
undermining
the
strike
need
not
have
been
made
so
easy
As
far
as
Tony
Benn
was
concerned
these
were
his
people
and
he
had
to
fight
for
them
regardless
of
the
national
issues
He
would
be
up
at
a.m
to
do
the
round
of
the
picket
lines
taking
soup
and
good
cheer
to
the
men
at
nearby
collieries
He
was
particularly
welcome
at
times
of
high
tension
because
police
behaviour
was
more
restrained
when
a
senior
politician
was
observing
He
toured
the
country
speaking
for
the
miners
addressing
meetings
in
their
support
in
the
year
of
the
strike
He
visited
the
USA
Canada
and
Italy
encouraging
international
support
and
collecting
donations
In
Parliament
he
was
one
of
a
phalanx
of
Labour
MPs
arguing
that
the
government
had
engineered
the
dispute
to
assault
the
unions
criticising
police
conduct
attacking
the
penal
bail
conditions
imposed
by
magistrates
courts
on
arrested
pickets
pointing
out
the
involvement
of
the
armed
forces
in
supplying
facilities
used
in
the
policing
of
mining
communities
accusing
the
government
of
telephone
tapping
and
of
slowing
down
the
processing
of
applications
for
welfare
benefits
for
miners
families
to
put
pressure
on
them
to
return
to
work
He
raised
the
question
of
the
British
Embassy
in
Oslo
demanding
information
from
a
Norwegian
trade
union
about
the
extent
of
its
support
for
the
NUM
and
later
called
for
an
amnesty
for
miners
who
had
been
imprisoned
during
the
strike
The
strike
transformed
British
politics
Miners
support
groups
around
the
country
particularly
in
the
relatively
prosperous
south
adopted
a
mining
community
and
collected
money
and
supplies
for
them
Cultural
stereotypes
were
challenged
as
north
and
south
met
Most
significantly
the
role
of
women
in
traditional
industrial
communities
was
changed
beyond
recognition
as
the
women's
support
groups
took
command
of
the
home
front
and
became
involved
in
politics
often
for
the
first
time
Chesterfield
Women's
Action
Group
ran
the
main
distribution
network
distributing
food
parcels
to
thirty-four
other
centres
in
North
Derbyshire
On
the
middle
ground
stood
the
TUC
and
the
Labour
Party
whose
members
often
showed
individual
sympathy
to
the
miners
cause
but
were
not
prepared
to
countenance
any
industrial
action
in
their
support
Collieries
in
Nottinghamshire
Warwickshire
and
Leicestershire
continued
to
produce
coal
Coal
was
still
being
shipped
in
from
abroad
There
were
no
power
cuts
The
government
too
had
those
who
wished
to
make
a
display
of
solidarity
and
right-wing
figures
funded
legal
actions
by
working
miners
against
the
NUM
The
union
was
subject
to
other
actions
under
trade
union
legislation
the
net
result
of
which
was
the
sequestration
of
its
assets
This
led
to
a
financial
paralysis
eased
only
by
some
exceptionally
creative
accounting
Nor
was
the
government
prepared
to
be
caught
out
by
flying
pickets
or
mass
picketing
The
new
trade
union
laws
were
augmented
by
new
national
co-ordinating
powers
for
the
police
Cars
of
pickets
would
be
stopped
hundreds
of
miles
from
their
destination
and
turned
back
on
the
picket
lines
police
fought
miners
with
a
ferocity
unparalleled
in
the
recent
past
The
enduring
image
of
the
miners
strike
was
of
mounted
police
charging
relentlessly
into
miners
at
the
Orgreave
coking
depot
at
Rotherham
on
June
Police
in
full
riot
gear
crashed
through
the
crowds
of
miners
lashing
out
with
truncheons
in
a
spectacle
which
was
criticised
as
suspending
the
rule
of
law
to
maintain
public
order
Prosecution
cases
against
each
of
the
ninety-five
people
charged
with
offences
that
day
collapsed
and
South
Yorkshire
police
paid
half
a
million
pounds
in
damages
and
costs
to
thirty-nine
miners
who
were
injured
The
Independent
June
Orgreave
was
just
the
most
infamous
example
Violence
was
widespread
during
the
strike
and
was
by
no
means
limited
to
the
police
attacks
on
working
miners
by
strikers
resulted
in
manslaughter
on
one
occasion
Moral
questions
about
the
violence
aside
the
most
important
issue
was
whether
it
was
strategically
advisable
to
continue
to
use
the
weapon
of
the
mass
picket
when
it
was
ineffective
in
achieving
its
objectives
resulted
in
a
terrifying
level
of
casualties
and
damaged
the
miners
cause
in
the
public
mind
by
associating
them
with
intimidatory
tactics
It
was
as
if
Arthur
Scargill
unable
to
achieve
a
victory
decided
to
have
a
massacre
instead
driving
the
troops
in
wave
after
wave
day
after
day
towards
an
incomparably
better-armed
and
organised
enemy
as
if
it
were
hoped
that
the
magnitude
of
the
sacrifice
alone
would
bring
active
support
from
the
rest
of
industry
Ken
Coates
urged
Benn
to
use
his
influence
with
Arthur
Scargill
to
change
the
strategy
Benn
would
not
and
did
not
regret
his
decision
later
He
said
I
have
no
doubts
about
it
at
all
Arthur
was
one
of
the
few
trade
union
leaders
I
have
ever
met
in
my
life
who
wasn't
looking
for
a
peerage
he
was
trying
to
defend
his
members
He
was
a
tough
character
and
his
leadership
of
the
miners
was
very
strong
It
was
a
consolidated
campaign
and
you
had
to
back
them
When
there's
a
dispute
it
comes
to
the
point
who's
side
are
you
on
That
was
the
basic
argument
IV
Tony
Benn
June
The
heroic
nature
of
the
struggle
seemed
to
have
overturned
Benn's
political
judgement
He
had
always
tended
to
romanticise
the
working
class
Now
his
own
constituency
was
part
of
the
very
aristocracy
of
labour
He
represented
miners
who
were
fighting
for
the
survival
of
their
communities
and
suffering
greater
hardships
than
the
country
had
seen
since
the
war
Once
he
arrived
late
at
a
meeting
of
left-wingers
in
the
House
of
Commons
and
said
I've
just
been
with
the
miners
they
are
like
Greek
gods
Ken
Coates
agreed
they
were
nice
young
lads
and
had
had
more
sunshine
than
they
were
used
to
IV
Ken
Coates
December
Coates
urged
a
political
campaign
to
unify
the
country
behind
the
miners
cause
He
wanted
to
change
the
nature
of
the
debate
from
one
of
industrial
militancy
to
a
household
question
He
said
The
political
instrument
was
to
set
fire
to
Thatcher's
tents
behind
her
lines
to
make
a
major
crusade
in
the
country
about
fuel
poverty
and
the
need
to
connect
the
dispute
with
welfare
with
the
relief
of
hypothermia
the
distribution
of
all
this
coal
to
the
poor
Ibid
Benn's
failure
to
support
this
initiative
at
the
NEC
caused
the
cooling
of
one
of
the
most
valuable
and
stabilising
political
friendships
of
his
life
Coates's
scheme
may
have
seemed
idealistic
but
it
was
a
model
of
realism
compared
to
Tony
Benn's
proposal
for
a
general
strike
to
protect
free
trade
unionism
Speech
at
St
Ives
reported
in
full
in
Socialist
Action
December
At
the
end
of
the
year-long
strike
the
miners
agreed
to
return
to
work
proudly
flying
their
banners
and
marching
behind
their
bands
On
March
Benn
joined
the
miners
and
their
wives
at
a.m
to
march
to
Markham
Colliery
It
was
an
extraordinary
day
he
wrote
I
felt
drained
of
all
emotion
by
the
end
of
it
because
every
emotion
swept
through
me
like
a
gale
tragedy
wanting
to
weep
at
seeing
these
people
who
had
sacrificed
so
much
having
to
go
back
without
having
won
then
tremendous
pride
that
they
could
go
back
with
their
banners
high
and
not
give
any
sort
of
impression
that
they
were
beaten
which
they
are
not
of
course
Then
a
feeling
of
hope
and
dignity
as
we
stood
there
and
applauded
as
they
all
went
into
the
colliery
BD
March
One
of
Benn's
greatest
leadership
qualities
was
his
strength
in
defeat
In
the
difficult
days
after
the
strike
he
told
them
all
was
not
lost
We
can
look
back
with
pride
at
what
has
been
done
he
said
to
the
Durham
Miners
Gala
confident
that
future
generations
will
commemorate
the
heroes
of
Saltley
and
Orgreave
just
as
now
we
celebrate
the
Tolpuddle
Martyrs
and
the
Chartists
Nor
could
it
be
claimed
that
the
cause
for
which
the
strike
took
place
the
prevention
of
pit
closures
was
ill
judged
Between
the
end
of
the
strike
and
the
Coal
Board
closed
pits
and
made
men
redundant
No
protection
was
given
by
the
government
to
the
miners
who
had
worked
through
the
strike
or
to
the
breakaway
union
which
was
formed
during
it
The
underlying
reason
for
the
success
of
the
Thatcher
government
in
the
strike
was
that
the
nation
was
no
longer
reliant
on
British-mined
coal
for
fuelling
power
stations
One
of
the
reasons
for
the
push
toward
nuclear
power
was
to
reduce
national
reliance
on
the
truculent
and
well
organised
mine
workers
As
someone
who
had
been
responsible
for
energy
longer
than
any
other
minister
taking
some
responsibility
for
it
in
all
three
of
his
cabinet
posts
Benn
contributed
weightily
to
the
debate
over
nuclear
power
and
in
particular
the
inquiries
over
which
system
to
use
for
the
new
series
of
reactors
Officials
at
the
Department
of
Energy
still
wanted
to
commission
Pressurised
Water
Reactors
which
were
an
American
development
pointing
to
the
success
of
the
French
nuclear
industry
which
had
pushed
ahead
with
PWRs
and
had
nearly
per
cent
of
its
electricity
produced
by
nuclear
power
as
against
less
than
per
cent
in
the
UK
Benn
argued
that
the
true
cost
of
nuclear
power
had
never
been
made
explicit
because
so
many
of
the
costs
were
carried
in
the
defence
budget
which
resulted
from
the
tie
up
between
the
civil
and
military
uses
of
nuclear
power
The
government
was
eventually
obliged
to
hold
an
inquiry
into
the
commissioning
of
a
Pressurised
Water
Reactor
at
Sizewell
in
Suffolk
Benn
worked
closely
with
the
National
Union
of
Mineworkers
in
in
preparing
evidence
for
the
inquiry
an
activity
which
incidentally
stood
him
in
good
stead
with
leading
figures
in
the
NUM
when
he
needed
them
when
he
was
fighting
to
be
selected
at
Chesterfield
At
the
Sizewell
inquiry
Benn
argued
that
the
building
of
a
coal-fired
power
station
was
cheaper
and
with
lower
construction
costs
and
less
environmental
damage
especially
when
decommissioning
occurs
than
a
nuclear
station
The
station
did
go
ahead
and
six
years
later
he
gave
evidence
at
a
similar
inquiry
into
the
siting
of
another
PWR
at
Hinkley
Point
in
Somerset
He
was
not
restrained
in
his
verbal
evidence
to
the
Hinkley
Point
inquiry
saying
that
for
eight
years
in
the
various
departments
he
headed
I
was
told
time
and
time
again
by
my
officials
Secretary
of
State
Minister
of
Technology
We
understand
your
feelings
but
of
course
you
have
got
to
face
the
harsh
reality
that
nuclear
power
is
cheaper
It
was
a
lie
I
hate
to
use
plain
language
in
this
way
I
was
lied
to
time
and
again
because
the
true
economics
of
this
was
known
from
the
beginning
I
ask
myself
Why
did
they
lie
to
the
Minister
They
lied
to
the
Minister
because
they
wanted
the
Minister
to
go
on
saying
this
was
an
atoms
for
peace
programme
when
actually
it
was
an
atoms
for
war
programme
The
whole
basis
of
this
has
been
nuclear
weapons
from
the
beginning
I
blame
myself
very
seriously
for
being
so
trusting
but
I
did
not
appreciate
the
full
implications
at
the
time
TB
evidence
to
Hinkley
Point
C
Inquiry
April
While
the
behaviour
of
some
civil
servants
may
have
been
Machiavellian
in
concealing
the
truth
in
order
to
enlist
the
idealistic
young
Tony
Benn
in
the
pro-nuclear
cause
the
fact
was
that
he
needed
little
encouragement
to
promote
nuclear
power
and
neither
did
the
civil
servants
The
civil
servants
also
were
seized
with
enthusiasm
a
for
a
bright
cheap
clean
future
for
civil
nuclear
power
and
in
their
enthusiasm
they
submerged
the
realities
in
their
own
minds
and
their
own
reports
They
too
were
victims
of
hope

SETTLING
FOR
ACTING
If
Richard
Burton
was
lucky
in
his
background
it
was
because
he
made
his
luck
Hundreds
of
thousands
the
industrialised
world
over
barely
rose
above
the
daily
survival
hard
enough
in
many
cases
To
get
out
was
a
considerable
achievement
to
go
on
to
etch
his
own
personality
on
the
world
was
so
rare
as
to
be
wonderful
but
to
do
it
on
his
own
terms
in
his
own
way
and
to
do
exactly
as
he
wanted
was
astounding
No
surprise
that
every
single
person
who
met
him
wanted
to
turn
that
meeting
into
an
incident
an
anecdote
an
event
His
genius
was
above
all
in
what
he
was
Burton
soared
he
made
it
look
effortless
and
he
put
no
one
down
in
the
process
And
few
cared
to
try
to
put
him
down
Out
of
his
family's
travails
he
helped
to
make
a
fastness
of
domestic
security
Cis
Ifor
and
the
barricades
of
brothers
sisters
cousins
aunts
ever-open
houses
out
of
the
outwardly
unpromising
landscape
of
a
war-battered
low-waged
steel
coal
and
chapel
culture
he
took
a
fine
voice
musical
knowledge
a
skill
in
many
sports
a
love
for
learning
and
he
never
forgot
that
a
few
shillings
would
and
did
make
the
difference
between
dignity
and
pity
poverty
and
decent
comfort
He
impressed
Meredith
Jones
as
he
impressed
Philip
Burton
both
to
an
extent
that
they
had
never
been
impressed
before
driving
them
to
help
him
help
himself
He
was
a
memorable
mixture
of
inner
repose
and
outer
restlessness
of
calculation
even
shrewdness
and
a
princely
carelessness
of
something
certain
never
to
be
shaken
only
perhaps
tested
and
eroded
as
the
years
went
by
and
something
uncertain
game
for
everything
and
willing
to
push
himself
to
the
point
of
self-destruction
Life
was
for
the
living
and
Rich
seized
it
If
we
live
out
much
of
our
developing
years
in
imitation
especially
of
those
most
close
to
us
then
Burton
very
soon
outstripped
guiding
example
The
tenacity
of
his
loyalty
brought
him
back
again
and
again
to
the
perfect
womanliness
of
Cis
and
the
unmatchable
maleness
of
Ifor
but
in
his
wider
field
of
operation
they
were
no
more
than
a
couple
of
reference
points
the
rest
of
the
map
had
to
be
filled
in
by
Philip
by
Meredith
by
rugby
heroes
by
the
poets
but
most
of
all
and
as
he
went
along
by
himself
One
thing
is
clear
He
went
at
it
very
hard
punishingly
perhaps
even
at
that
stage
dangerously
hard
Though
physically
a
lightly
built
rugby
player
he
never
hesitated
to
go
for
the
top
league
and
would
be
bounced
and
shaken
regularly
He
drank
when
young
and
while
still
young
drank
a
lot
challenging
himself
to
knock
off
all
comers
but
most
of
all
to
align
himself
with
the
legendary
drinking
miners
who
could
and
did
sweat
it
off
down
the
pit
while
Richard
had
to
force
it
off
in
games
And
perhaps
through
the
drinking
he
sought
to
meet
his
father
of
whom
he
spoke
so
little
and
to
whom
it
seemed
the
older
he
grew
he
meant
so
little
He
smoked
a
lot
which
hit
the
hard-worked
lungs
while
the
boils
surged
up
out
of
a
weakness
in
nutrition
which
together
with
the
ill-starred
Jenkins
bones
augured
ill
for
long
life
and
clean
living
Neither
seemed
to
interest
him
much
That
outer
evidence
of
strain
and
clash
was
balanced
by
the
hugely
admired
stillness
the
self-possession
That
came
most
from
his
wide-apart
blue-green
eyes
the
sculptured
bones
covered
with
wasted
skin
the
rare
smile
The
finest
expression
of
himself
lay
in
his
love
for
language
In
one
respect
it
was
a
particular
and
technical
interest
He
was
a
crossword
fiend
an
acrostic
fanatic
an
inveterate
amateur
etymologist
and
a
Berlitz
blitzer
on
new
tongues
The
constant
book-bag
was
a
working
kit
Even
for
a
short
weekend
trip
Sally
his
widow
wrote
there
would
be
a
dictionary
the
complete
works
of
Shakespeare
the
Oxford
Book
of
English
Verse
the
Koran
a
Larousse
an
atlas
together
with
paperback
copies
of
the
Oxford
Book
of
Quotations
a
reader's
encyclopaedia
and
then
there
were
the
new
novels
and
biographies
and
history
bought
in
paperback
raids
In
his
heyday
he
had
a
memory
like
a
clamp
Put
to
it
he
could
recite
some
of
Shakespeare's
sonnets
backwards
that
was
one
of
his
party
tricks
Tumultuous
chunks
of
the
Bible
in
English
and
then
in
Welsh
the
great
monologues
of
Shakespeare
Manley
Hopkins
Baudelaire
Rimbaud
Donne
Dylan
Thomas
those
could
all
be
turned
to
account
and
were
But
the
passion
was
no
party
show
If
he
had
one
talent
above
all
Alec
Guinness
has
singled
it
out
as
his
greatest
gift
it
was
for
reading
verse
with
intelligence
and
passion
He
did
it
because
he
was
intoxicated
by
it
and
he
had
found
it
for
himself
It
was
the
force
that
through
the
green
fuse
drove
him
The
only
thing
in
life
is
language
he
said
with
Elizabeth
Taylor
in
tears
beside
him
Not
love
Not
anything
else
The
acting
was
almost
a
by-product
of
that
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
fortuitous
advertisement
in
Cardiff's
Western
Mail
it
might
have
remained
just
that
Oxford
the
scholarship
would
then
have
been
the
defining
influence
become
the
place
in
which
he
could
have
planted
his
flag
and
redrawn
himself
As
it
was
another
Welsh
wizard
was
to
pipe
him
away
The
announcement
proclaimed
that
Welsh
actors
and
actresses
were
needed
by
the
eminent
playwright
director
and
actor
Emlyn
Williams
to
fill
small
parts
in
his
new
play
which
will
open
in
London
in
the
autumn
In
particular
he
wanted
a
Welsh
boy
actor
Philip
Burton
sent
off
Richard's
name
immediately
His
boy
was
in
good
shape
Anxious
waiting
for
the
results
of
his
examination
with
varied
experience
in
school
plays
Mime
in
Les
Mis
rables
a
big
leading
role
Professor
Higgins
a
virtuoso
turn
as
an
American
businessman
in
Youth
At
The
Helm
he
had
impressed
everyone
by
talking
into
five
telephones
at
once
everybody
in
Taibach
talked
about
it
Cis
heard
accounts
up
and
down
the
street
work
on
the
radio
and
above
all
those
scrupulous
sessions
in
Ma
Smith's
front
room
and
on
the
high
hills
schoolteacher
and
pupil
two
sons
of
miners
in
Wales
striving
to
speak
the
language
of
Shakespeare
faultlessly
He
walked
it
Also
all
of
seventeen
he
made
a
pass
at
the
attractive
sophisticated
casting
director
Daphne
Rye
the
most
influential
casting
director
in
Great
Britain
Three
years
later
it
was
she
who
gave
him
his
passport
from
the
limbo
of
a
long
RAF
demobilisation
process
to
the
West
End
But
it
was
Emlyn
Williams
he
conquered
at
that
stage
and
Emlyn
Williams
mattered
He
was
to
give
him
a
part
which
would
take
him
into
the
West
End
a
few
months
after
leaving
school
write
a
special
role
for
him
in
what
would
be
his
first
film
introduce
him
to
his
future
wife
and
through
one
of
his
sons
Brook
provide
him
with
a
lifelong
younger
brother
More
than
all
that
though
he
showed
Richard
the
way
By
some
terrific
fluke
Richard
came
face
to
face
with
his
future
at
the
precise
time
he
most
needed
to
see
it
For
Emlyn
Williams
had
walked
where
Richard
began
to
realise
he
now
wanted
to
tread
Williams
pointed
in
a
direction
and
Richard
followed
it
Williams
himself
a
miner's
son
had
found
his
way
out
of
Wales
and
out
of
the
pits
via
a
schoolteacher
a
woman
on
whom
he
had
based
his
hit
play
The
Corn
Is
Green
In
the
play
a
boy
from
the
pits
is
discovered
by
the
schoolteacher
and
after
furious
efforts
gets
into
Oxford
University
And
in
Oxford
the
Welsh
boy
had
launched
himself
as
a
nationally
acclaimed
actor
and
playwright
Emlyn
Williams
was
precisely
the
right
man
to
be
the
next
guru
But
once
again
Burton
had
to
win
and
hold
his
luck
Williams
recalled
that
first
audition
vividly
He
was
a
most
spectacular-looking
boy
Marvellous
green-blue
eyes
and
he
had
Repose
Nothing
precocious
Nothing
smart-alec
Almost
shy
but
sure
of
himself
you
know
It
was
Williams's
perceptive
and
remarkable
schoolteacher
Sarah
Grace
Cooke
who
met
him
and
said
to
Emlyn
He's
like
you
but
he
has
the
devil
in
him
You
haven't
It
was
a
devil
longing
to
get
out
and
Emlyn's
gentle
comedy
The
Druid's
Rest
gave
the
devil
its
chance
The
boy
saw
what
fun
and
mischief
was
to
be
had
The
devil
grabbed
it
and
was
on
the
loose
for
ever
after
Burton's
devil
was
a
terrible
and
limitless
sense
of
driving
pleasure
it
was
fuelled
by
awesome
capacity
and
the
hunger
of
those
who
cannot
believe
that
such
fortune
will
not
vanish
before
their
appetite
is
appeased
He
was
barely
eighteen
he
was
to
go
on
a
tour
of
the
fabled
cities
of
England
he
was
to
be
thrown
in
with
chorus
girls
drink
with
vagabonds
of
the
stage
have
the
money
for
floosies
and
low
bars
time
to
read
and
time
to
talk
and
be
praised
for
doing
this
stage
work
which
was
not
work
at
all
Acting
was
Open
Sesame
And
he
had
a
friend
in
this
Celtic
lust
for
life
Stanley
Baker
his
understudy
another
son
of
a
miner
much
poorer
than
Richard's
family
and
again
someone
plucked
from
that
army
of
industrialised
subjects
by
a
schoolteacher
A
couple
of
years
younger
Baker
looked
older
and
had
already
appeared
in
a
film
The
two
boys
from
the
puritan
villages
of
Wales
set
themselves
up
as
hell-raisers
to
the
world
Windows
were
smashed
clean
out
in
fourth-floor
dressing
rooms
as
actor
and
understudy
flared
up
into
a
fight
Dreadful
punishments
were
promised
by
Emlyn
Next
night
the
same
Dock
pubs
in
Liverpool
in
wartime
full
of
enthralling
and
wicked
characters
Train
journeys
to
cold
suburbs
and
the
first
recorded
attempt
at
love-making
ending
in
fear
of
eternal
damnation
as
he
dozed
off
in
front
of
the
fire
afterwards
and
his
socks
began
to
smoulder
So
sex
sent
you
straight
to
hell!
Torn
between
a
huge
urge
to
do
everything
and
a
huge
ignorance
about
how
to
go
about
it
Leaning
through
their
window
to
sting
the
breasts
of
the
sunning
chorus
girls
with
ammo
from
their
pea-shooters
in
the
morning
in
the
evening
beer
all
round
and
trying
to
coax
them
up
an
alley
Quite
dizzy
with
the
glamour
of
it
all
Philip
came
up
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
for
a
week
or
so
So
did
Ifor
But
he
was
out
on
his
own
now
He
was
the
most
beautiful
boy
I'd
ever
seen
said
Gladys
Henson
who
played
his
stage
mother
He
was
always
lolling

always
so
calm
He
took
everything
in
his
stride
the
theatre
was
quite
secondary
to
his
interest
in
rugby
he
never
stopped
talking
about
the
game!
I
said
to
him
don't
go
to
sleep
in
the
middle
of
rehearsals!
And
he
said
Oh
you
know
me
Glad
I
go
my
own
way
Burton
was
living
off
the
land
and
he
loved
it
An
almighty
cloudburst
of
possibilities
had
cascaded
over
his
head
and
he
loved
that
too
Emlyn
Williams
might
have
pointed
his
finger
to
Art
to
the
Theatre
to
Magic
and
Burton
had
time
for
all
three
but
later
What
hit
him
most
was
what
hit
him
first
What
a
life
what
fun
what
pickings
were
there
here!
Perhaps
it
did
not
in
truth
add
up
to
very
much
A
few
smashed
windows
drink
a
fight
or
two
umpteen
girls
almost
conquered
long
tall
stories
almost
believed
but
compared
with
what
he
had
been
used
to
it
was
the
lure
of
the
Orient
freedom
the
cry
of
the
Sirens
And
all
he
had
to
do
was
be
this
other
person
and
convince
everybody
Which
he
did
In
a
wretched
part
he
played
Glan
the
elder
son
of
publicans
Richard
Burton
showed
exceptional
ability
wrote
the
New
Statesman
He
would
claim
that
it
was
the
sentence
which
changed
his
life
convinced
him
that
acting
was
worth
doing
All
that
and
an
accolade
from
the
intellectual
socialist
weekly!
If
only
he
could
keep
in
touch
with
that
centre
of
himself
which
somehow
mysteriously
enabled
him
to
do
this
acting
business
then
all
the
rest
would
be

Churchill
himself
was
convinced
that
there
would
be
war
with
the
Soviet
Union
within
a
few
years
In
May
he
told
Mackenzie
King
the
Canadian
Prime
Minister
that
within
eight
years
when
the
Soviets
had
developed
their
own
atomic
bomb
there
would
be
The
greatest
war
the
most
terrible
war
which
may
mean
the
end
of
our
civilisation
But
he
still
retained
his
admiration
for
Stalin
stating
he
would
trust
him
further
than
any
other
Russian
leader
He
felt
Stalin's
word
could
be
relied
on
He
was
the
one
man
in
Russia
today
who
could
save
a
situation
and
might
save
it
The
Mackenzie
King
Record
Vol
p
In
public
Churchill
asserted
that
the
Soviets
had
roughly
combat-ready
divisions
in
Eastern
Europe
poised
to
attack
the
West
In
fact
the
Soviet
Army
was
being
rapidly
demobilised
they
were
even
ripping
up
many
of
the
railway
lines
in
eastern
Germany
they
would
require
for
mounting
an
invasion
and
were
taking
them
to
the
Soviet
Union
as
reparations
British
intelligence
estimates
which
Churchill
was
later
shown
privately
by
Attlee
in
the
autumn
of
suggested
a
Soviet
total
of
about
divisions
most
of
which
were
far
from
combat-ready
As
the
Fulton
address
made
clear
Churchill
had
convinced
himself
that
by
virtue
of
his
prophecies
in
the
s
he
was
a
reliable
forecaster
of
world
events
in
the
l940s
As
he
was
now
predicting
that
war
with
the
Soviet
Union
was
inevitable
he
believed
there
should
be
a
pre-emptive
nuclear
strike
before
the
Soviet
Union
developed
its
own
weapon
He
was
not
prepared
to
publicly
advocate
this
course
but
he
privately
began
to
develop
his
idea
of
nuclear
diplomacy
directed
against
the
Soviet
Union
He
told
Lord
Moran
in
August
We
ought
not
to
wait
until
Russia
is
ready
I
believe
it
will
be
eight
years
before
she
has
these
bombs
in
fact
it
was
less
than
three
America
knows
that
of
Russia's
motor
industry
is
in
Moscow
and
could
be
wiped
out
by
a
single
bomb
It
might
mean
wiping
out
three
million
people
but
they
would
think
nothing
of
that
Channon
Diary
p
The
next
year
as
the
Cold
War
deepened
he
again
spoke
privately
of
an
immediate
nuclear
attack
on
the
Soviet
Union
if
they
did
not
accept
the
West's
terms
for
their
withdrawal
from
Eastern
Europe
This
was
exactly
the
nuclear
blackmail
he
had
feared
if
the
Soviets
obtained
the
bomb
first
He
told
Mackenzie
King
in
November
that
the
war
of
nerves
had
gone
on
long
enough
and
if
a
stand
is
not
taken
within
the
next
few
weeks
within
five
years
or
a
much
shorter
time
there
would
be
another
world
war
in
which
we
shall
all
be
finished
Therefore
there
should
be
an
attack
before
the
Soviets
could
retaliate
with
nuclear
weapons
They
should
be
given
the
West's
terms
and
told
If
you
do
not
agree
to
that
here
and
now
within
so
many
days
we
will
attack
Moscow
and
your
other
cities
and
destroy
them
with
atomic
bombs
from
the
air
The

He
spoke
to
Lew
Douglas
the
US
Ambassador
in
London
and
told
him
now
is
the
time
promptly
to
tell
the
Soviets
that
if
they
do
not
retire
from
Berlin
and
abandon
Eastern
Germany
drawing
to
the
Polish
frontier
we
will
raze
their
cities
FRUS
Vol

In
July
he
wrote
to
Eisenhower
that
the
time
had
come
for
a
settlement
with
the
Soviet
Union
Now
they
were
to
be
forced
to
give
up
the
whole
of
Eastern
Europe
and
retire
within
their
borders
He
argued
the
moment
for
this
settlement
should
be
chosen
when
they
will
see
that
the
United
States
and
its
Allies
possess
overwhelming
force
WSC
Vol
p
Churchill
outlined
the
same
ideas
to
Eden
but
admitted
None
of
this
argument
is
fit
for
public
use
indeed
he
does
not
seem
to
have
considered
what
role
Western
public
opinion
would
play
in
all
these
schemes
to
threaten
a
nuclear
war
Ibid
p
The
furthest
he
would
go
was
at
the
Conservative
Party
conference
at
Llandudno
in
October
when
he
called
for
a
settlement
with
the
Soviet
Union
on
Western
terms
but
did
not
make
clear
what
that
entailed
The
development
of
the
first
Soviet
atomic
weapon
in
cooled
Churchill's
ardour
Nevertheless
he
still
thought
there
would
have
to
be
an
ultimatum
to
the
Soviet
Union
and
the
threat
of
war
He
told
guests
at
the
British
Embassy
in
Paris
in
September
that
the
United
States
would
not
stay
long
in
Europe
but
in
two
or
three
years
they
would
insist
on
having
a
show-down
and
Russia
would
have
to
withdraw
from
her
present
forward
positions
in
Poland
and
Czechoslovakia
or
there
would
be
war
Ibid
p
Once
in
power
Churchill
took
a
very
different
view
of
the
situation
As
part
of
the
response
to
what
was
being
widely
seen
as
an
increasing
Soviet
threat
Churchill
advocated
a
European
union
as
did
many
other
prominent
European
statesmen
in
the
aftermath
of
the
second
destructive
war
on
the
continent
within
thirty
years
Churchill
had
for
long
been
under
the
influence
of
Count
Coudenhove-Kalergi
and
his
Pan-European
Union
and
during
the
war
he
had
advocated
a
series
of
regional
groupings
including
Europe
within
the
new
United
Nations
though
this
had
been
rejected
by
the
Americans
among
others
But
when
Churchill
talked
about
Europe
he
had
continental
Europe
in
mind
Britain
was
not
to
be
part
of
this
European
Union
As
early
as
February
in
an
article
in
the
Saturday
Evening
Post
which
he
recycled
in
the
News
of
World
in
May
he
wrote
We
see
nothing
but
good
and
hope
in
a
richer
freer
more
contented
European
commonality
But
we
have
our
own
dream
and
our
own
task
We
are
with
Europe
but
not
of
it
We
are
linked
but
not
compromised
We
are
interested
and
associated
but
not
absorbed
In
parallel
he
argued
there
needed
to
be
a
proportionate
growth
of
solidarity
throughout
the
British
Empire
and
a
deepening
self-knowledge
and
mutual
recognition
among
the
English-speaking
peoples
Britain
would
only
watch
and
aid
the
process
of
European
union
Churchill
made
his
first
post-war
appeal
for
European
union
in
a
speech
in
Zurich
on
September
Wartime
experience
of
alliance
with
other
European
nations
had
not
changed
his
views
about
Britain's
benevolent
aloofness
Neither
was
there
any
sign
of
his
developing
any
more
practical
vision
of
an
institutional
framework
that
would
underpin
and
organise
the
groupings
he
advocated
The
scheme
he
outlined
very
vaguely
was
based
on
a
division
of
Europe
into
west
and
east
with
a
union
of
western
states
forming
a
bulwark
against
Communism
He
favoured
a
partnership
between
France
and
Germany
as
part
of
a
regional
structure
called
it
may
be
the
United
States
of
Europe
This
regional
organisation
would
be
within
the
UN
framework
because
this
larger
synthesis
will
only
survive
if
founded
upon
coherent
natural
groupings
There
is
already
a
natural
grouping
in
the
Western
hemisphere
We
British
have
our
commonwealth
of
Nations
And
why
should
there
not
be
a
European
group
Britain
along
with
the
United
States
and
possibly
the
Soviet
Union
would
be
one
of
the
friends
and
sponsors
of
the
new
Europe
Nowhere
in
the
speech
did
he
suggest
that
Britain
would
be
part
of
this
new
European
entity
Indeed
to
the
extent
that
a
more
unified
and
stronger
Europe
would
be
able
to
stand
up
to
the
Soviet
Union
it
would
lessen
the
need
for
any
British
intervention
on
the
continent
and
allow
her
to
concentrate
on
the
Empire
and
the
relationship
with
the
United
States
In
April
at
a
rally
in
the
Albert
Hall
entitled
Let
Europe
Arise
Churchill
though
favouring
European
unity
made
his
own
priority
absolutely
clear
we
shall
allow
no
wedge
to
be
driven
between
Great
Britain
and
the
United
States
of
America
At
the
party
conference
that
year
at
Brighton
in
October
he
suggested
that
Britain
should
be
the
vital
link
between
the
United
States
the
Commonwealth
and
a
European
union
In
May
he
attended
the
Hague
Congress
on
European
Union
a
meeting
of
largely
unelected
delegates
many
in
opposition
and
some
not
in
politics
at
all
Apart
from
Churchill
the
other
senior
figures
were
Spaak
Bidault
Schuman
Blum
Reynaud
and
Monnet
Much
of
Churchill's
speech
was
taken
up
by
the
need
for
unity
in
the
face
of
the
Communist
threat
His
one
proposal
was
for
a
European
Assembly
to
enable
the
voice
of
a
United
Europe
to
be
heard
But
he
did
not
spell
out
what
powers
it
would
have
apart
from
debate
and
propaganda
or
how
it
would
be
linked
to
the
Governments
of
Europe
The
Congress
went
further
and
called
for
European
economic
and
political
union
together
with
a
European
Parliament
and
a
Court
of
Human
Rights
At
this
point
the
British
Government
which
had
been
positive
about
the
idea
of
European
co-operation
in
the
immediate
post-war
period
became
sceptical
once
it
became
clear
that
the
aim
was
to
establish
supranational
institutions
The
Labour
Government
insisted
on
watering
down
the
Hague
proposals
into
the
Council
of
Europe
controlled
by
ministers
from
national
governments
and
a
virtually
powerless
Assembly
that
was
not
allowed
to
discuss
economics
or
defence
and
had
only
consultative
powers
on
other
subjects
The
British
delegation
to
the
Council
was
not
elected
but
appointed
by
the
Government
Churchill
led
the
Conservative
members
to
the
first
meeting
of
the
Assembly
in
Strasbourg
in
August
but
arrived
two
days
after
the
opening
and
left
immediately
after
his
own
speech
While
the
rest
of
western
Europe
was
moving
towards
a
form
of
union
that
went
further
than
just
co-operation
between
governments
Britain
was
on
the
sidelines
Like
the
Government
Churchill
rejected
any
idea
of
Britain
participating
in
European
supranational
institutions
Much
of
his
pro-Europe
rhetoric
was
carefully
chosen
designed
mainly
to
embarrass
the
Labour
Government
rather
than
advance
the
cause
of
European
unity
In
November
in
the
House
of
Commons
he
accepted
the
Government's
view
that
Britain
could
not
join
a
European
economic
system
if
the
Commonwealth
were
excluded
and
took
the
unrealistic
position
that
the
Commonwealth
should
be
part
of
any
European
trading
bloc
Although
he
urged
the
Government
to
take
part
in
the
talks
on
the
Schuman
plan
for
a
European
coal
and
steel
community
which
would
have
supranational
institutions
he
did
so
only
because
he
wanted
Britain
to
wreck
the
plan
Without
the
removal
of
the
offending
supranational
parts
of
the
proposed
treaty
he
thought
Britain
should
not
join
In
office
Churchill
was
to
take
no
interest
in
advancing
the
cause
of
European
union
or
promoting
Britain's
role
within
it
At
one
with
the
Labour
Government
over
its
policy
on
Europe
Churchill
also
found
it
difficult
to
articulate
a
clear
alternative
to
their
policy
in
one
of
the
most
complex
issues
it
had
to
face
the
future
of
India
Although
he
had
been
forced
under
political
pressure
to
agree
to
the
Cripps
offer
in
and
had
subsequently
done
his
best
to
sabotage
it
in
public
he
was
still
committed
to
it
however
much
he
disliked
any
move
towards
Indian
independence
In
practice
by
the
policy
that
Churchill
would
have
preferred
no
concessions
was
no
longer
practicable
The
British
did
not
have
the
power
to
rule
India
in
the
face
of
a
widespread
demand
for
independence
and
the
only
questions
remaining
were
about
the
terms
on
which
independence
would
be
granted
in
particular
whether
unity
would
be
maintained
or
whether
the
Muslim
provinces
would
be
given
the
right
to
secede
In
these
circumstances
Churchill
personally
favoured
a
highly
fragmented
India
becoming
a
multitude
of
subordinate
Dominions
with
a
long-term
British
presence
backed
by
an
army
but
it
was
difficult
to
advocate
such
a
policy
openly
The
result
was
a
policy
of
opposition
to
the
Government
but
no
coherent
statement
of
an
alternative

THE
INKLINGS
W
H
Auden
the
rising
star
of
the
English
poetic
firmament
met
Charles
Williams
about
a
year
after
Lewis
did
Auden
had
been
asked
by
the
Oxford
University
Press
to
prepare
The
Oxford
Book
of
Light
Verse
and
he
went
along
to
discuss
this
with
Williams
at
his
office
in
Amen
House
At
this
period
in
his
life
Auden
was
still
a
subscriber
to
the
bundle
of
ideologies
leftist
in
politics
atheist
in
religion
Freudian
in
psychology
which
went
with
being
a
s
intellectual
Yet
in
the
presence
of
Williams
he
felt
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
in
the
presence
of
personal
sanctity
I
had
met
many
good
people
before
who
made
me
feel
ashamed
of
my
own
shortcomings
but
in
the
presence
of
this
man
we
never
discussed
anything
but
literary
business
I
did
not
feel
ashamed
I
felt
transformed
into
a
person
who
was
incapable
of
doing
anything
base
or
unloving
T
S
Eliot
who
published
many
of
Williams's
books
felt
the
same
Eliot
had
first
met
Williams
of
all
unlikely
settings
at
a
tea-party
given
in
London
by
Lady
Ottoline
Morrell
and
felt
a
kind
of
benediction
emanating
from
this
curious
bespectacled
creature
who
appeared
to
combine
frail
physique
with
exceptional
vitality
Williams
was
a
man
who
was
able
to
hold
many
apparently
contradictory
ideas
in
harmony
For
example
he
was
able
to
reconcile
membership
of
the
Church
of
England
rather
High
with
belonging
to
such
occult
groups
as
the
Order
of
the
Golden
Dawn
Thomas
Cranmer
and
Aleister
Crowley
were
held
in
uneasy
balance
in
his
sympathies
A
rather
unsatisfactory
marriage
was
glorified
in
his
imagination
by
high-sounding
comparisons
between
himself
and
Dante
while
his
largely
innocent
office
romances
which
do
not
appear
to
have
gone
much
beyond
crushes
on
secretaries
were
seen
in
terms
of
Launcelot's
devotion
to
Guinevere
and
the
threatened
breaking
of
the
Round
Table
Entirely
self-educated
and
cockney
in
speech
Williams
rather
like
Blake
in
an
earlier
generation
of
London
mystics
had
an
almost
matter-of-fact
awareness
of
the
other
world
Angels
or
angelicals
as
he
would
have
preferred
to
call
them
in
his
strange
idiolect
were
as
real
to
him
as
omnibuses
or
mortgage
repayments
and
far
more
likely
to
obtrude
into
his
consciousness
In
his
theological
writings
it
is
not
always
easy
to
see
at
what
point
he
steps
over
the
borderline
between
magic
and
religion
In
his
fiction
there
is
an
analogous
blurring
of
distinctions
shocking
or
thrilling
depending
on
the
reader's
taste
Once
Oxford
University
Press
had
accepted
The
Allegory
of
Love
for
publication
it
was
sent
to
Charles
Williams
who
worked
on
their
editorial
desk
in
London
It
so
happened
entirely
by
coincidence
that
Coghill
lent
Lewis
a
copy
of
Williams's
novel
The
Place
of
the
Lion
at
precisely
this
moment
The
merits
contained
in
any
Williams
novel
and
this
one
has
many
are
not
purely
literary
Indeed
none
of
his
novels
is
well
shaped
or
well
written
The
characters
have
improbable
names
and
say
improbable
things
The
excitement
of
The
Place
of
the
Lion
is
in
its
power
to
shake
the
reader
up
to
make
us
feel
that
the
world
is
not
the
place
we
thought
it
was
Here
for
example
we
meet
a
very
ordinary
young
woman
with
the
very
extraordinary
name
of
Damaris
Tighe
She
is
the
sort
of
girl
we
might
meet
in
the
pages
of
a
Barbara
Pym
a
bit
of
a
scholar
leading
a
spinsterly
existence
in
a
middle-class
house
in
an
English
country
village
But
she
is
in
fact
in
grave
theological
and
spiritual
error
Her
subject
is
the
relationship
between
the
angels
of
medieval
philosophers
and
the
Ideas
and
Forms
in
Plato
Her
paper
The
Eidoli
and
the
Angeli
is
not
a
suitable
one
to
read
to
the
little
study
group
which
meets
in
a
neighbour's
house
the
group
it
transpires
is
actually
in
touch
with
the
world
of
spirits
These
people
are
not
like
Damaris
dry-as-dust
unbelieving
intellectuals
They
are
magicians
and
hierophants
The
Eidoli
and
the
Angeli
have
power
to
invade
even
dull
suburban
English
houses
Damaris
discovers
that
she
has
been
guilty
of
intellectual
sin
in
failing
to
believe
to
realize
imaginatively
the
nature
of
the
material
she
is
studying
This
is
rather
like
the
moment
in
Lewis's
life
when
he
described
philosophy
as
a
subject
and
Barfield
replied
that
to
Plato
philosophy
was
not
a
subject
but
a
way
In
The
Place
of
the
Lion
the
Platonic
archetypes
of
which
objects
and
creatures
in
the
world
are
but
reflections
or
repetitions
actually
appear
A
lion
which
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
seems
as
though
it
might
just
be
an
escaped
animal
from
a
nearby
zoo
turns
out
to
be
the
great
Lion
of
Strength
Perhaps
the
most
extraordinary
moment
in
the
story
is
when
the
Butterfly
appears
and
all
the
butterflies
in
the
world
in
a
great
swarm
are
absorbed
back
into
his
essence
Lewis
was
overwhelmed
by
reading
this
book
In
the
course
of
time
we
begin
to
read
Williams's
influence
in
Lewis's
own
work
the
Lion
of
Strength
will
reappear
as
Aslan
Judah's
Lion
crushing
the
Serpent's
Head
in
the
Chronicles
of
Narnia
for
example
The
immediate
impact
in
February
was
inner
and
self-disciplinary
The
reading
of
it
has
been
a
good
preparation
for
Lent
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
for
it
shows
me
through
the
heroine
the
special
sin
of
abuse
of
intellect
to
which
all
my
profession
are
liable
more
clearly
than
I
ever
saw
before
I
have
learned
more
than
I
ever
knew
about
humility
In
fact
it
has
been
a
big
experience
If
Lewis
had
been
learning
more
than
he
knew
before
about
humility
Williams
had
been
learning
more
than
he
knew
before
about
medieval
literature
At
the
very
moment
Lewis
was
finishing
The
Place
of
the
Lion
Williams
was
reading
The
Allegory
of
Love
with
great
admiration
I
regard
your
book
as
practically
the
only
one
that
I
have
ever
come
across
since
Dante
that
shows
the
slightest
understanding
of
what
this
very
peculiar
identity
of
love
and
religion
means
Williams
wrote
signing
himself
Very
gratefully
yours
The
bulk
of
Lewis's
book
is
pure
literary
history
though
its
earlier
chapters
refer
to
the
strange
pseudo-religion
of
Love
which
appears
to
have
originated
in
twelfth-century
Provence
But
it
is
entirely
characteristic
of
Williams
whose
head
was
always
buzzing
with
Dante
and
with
the
dangerous
borderlines
between
sacred
and
profane
love
that
he
should
have
read
The
Allegory
in
that
way
Not
long
after
this
Lewis
and
Williams
met
in
London
as
they
continued
to
do
at
irregular
intervals
for
the
next
three
years
They
really
were
very
different
types
Williams
was
emotionally
exuberant
Lewis
was
profoundly
buttoned
up
Lewis
was
plump
and
rather
coarse
in
appearance
Williams
who
has
been
unkindly
likened
to
a
monkey
was
actually
rather
ethereal
in
manner
with
his
long
fingers
and
piercing
eyes
The
ugly
voice
was
not
merely
ugly
it
was
by
many
accounts
half-hypnotic
But
different
as
they
were
in
appearance
temperament
and
background
they
discovered
in
common
a
strong
belief
in
the
absolute
reality
of
the
supernatural
world
It
had
been
latent
in
Lewis
ever
since
his
encounter
with
God
in
Magdalen
in
the
summer
of
But
to
meet
Williams
was
to
make
the
belief
yet
more
inescapable
Many
readers
of
The
Place
of
the
Lion
would
be
unable
to
convict
the
heroine
of
sin
at
all
She
is
a
modern
woman
with
a
modern
consciousness
How
can
we
expect
her
to
adopt
the
thought
patterns
of
an
earlier
age
This
problem
of
historical
relativism
is
one
of
the
most
besetting
for
anyone
who
wishes
to
read
an
old
book
without
either
getting
it
hopelessly
wrong
or
worse
assuming
that
the
fact
that
we
are
modern
and
the
author
of
the
book
medieval
or
old
implies
the
superiority
of
one
or
the
other
Quite
apart
from
the
problem
of
the
factual
reliability
of
old
books
is
it
so
for
example
that
there
really
are
such
eidoli
and
angeli
as
Williams
Abelard
Pseudo-Dionysus
and
Plato
believed
we
meet
much
earlier
the
simple
difficulty
of
adjusting
to
old
meanings
Learning
an
old
language
Middle
English
Old
French
Latin
is
more
than
an
exercise
in
matching
modern
word
for
old
word
It
often
involves
the
modern
mind's
entering
into
old
concepts
for
which
there
is
no
modern
equivalent
What
writers
from
past
centuries
believed
about
the
world
the
sky
themselves
is
often
untranslatable
and
we
will
never
quite
master
it
without
the
help
of
a
guide
This
was
the
task
Lewis
set
himself
The
Oxford
lectures
which
he
gave
at
this
time
were
eventually
to
be
published
as
The
Discarded
Image
perhaps
the
most
completely
satisfying
and
impressive
book
he
ever
published
One
could
wish
it
eight
times
as
long
a
great
compendium
like
Burton's
Anatomy
of
Melancholy
The
subtitle
of
the
book
is
An
Introduction
to
Medieval
and
Renaissance
Literature
But
this
is
not
a
work
of
criticism
nor
an
attempt
to
make
you
like
The
Faerie
Queene
or
the
Confessio
Amantis
It
is
a
wide-ranging
analysis
of
the
world
picture
which
almost
all
the
old
writers
would
have
taken
for
granted
but
which
we
our
minds
fed
with
different
mythologies
and
sciences
would
very
easily
mistake
How
for
instance
did
a
medieval
man
look
at
the
sky
Having
early
disposed
of
the
false
idea
that
in
the
Middle
Ages
people
believed
in
a
flat
earth
Lewis
tells
us
to
look
at
the
sky
itself
You
must
go
out
on
a
starry
night
and
walk
about
for
half
an
hour
trying
to
see
the
sky
in
terms
of
the
old
Ptolemaic
cosmology
Remember
that
you
now
have
an
absolute
Up
and
Down
The
Earth
is
really
the
centre
really
the
lowest
place
movement
to
it
from
whatever
direction
is
downward
movement
As
a
modern
you
located
the
stars
at
a
great
distance
For
distance
you
must
now
substitute
that
very
special
and
far
less
abstract
sort
of
distance
which
we
call
height
height
which
speaks
immediately
to
our
muscles
and
nerves
The
Medieval
Model
is
vertiginous
And
the
fact
that
the
height
of
the
stars
in
medieval
astronomy
is
very
small
compared
with
their
distance
in
modern
will
turn
out
not
to
have
the
kind
of
importance
you
anticipated
To
look
out
on
the
night
sky
with
modern
eyes
is
like
looking
about
one
in
a
trackless
forest
trees
forever
and
no
horizon
To
look
up
at
the
towering
medieval
universe
is
much
more
like
looking
at
a
great
building
The
space
of
modern
astronomy
may
arouse
terror
or
bewilderment
or
vague
reverie
the
spheres
of
the
old
writers
present
us
with
an
object
in
which
the
mind
can
rest
overwhelming
in
its
greatness
but
satisfying
in
its
harmony
That
is
the
sense
in
which
our
universe
is
romantic
and
theirs
was
classical
By
the
time
we
have
finished
his
chapter
called
The
Heavens
we
have
not
only
been
informed
about
what
the
shape
of
the
Ptolemaic
universe
was
like
and
how
the
belief
in
astrology
worked
and
how
much
knowledge
was
in
our
sense
scientific
and
how
much
poetic
or
mythological
We
have
actually
had
our
picture
of
the
universe
changed
for
ever
By
this
I
do
not
mean
that
Lewis
has
represented
the
medieval
picture
as
better
than
the
modern
but
he
has
shown
us
that
both
are
merely
pictures
And
in
understanding
the
old
picture
so
vividly
he
has
prepared
us
to
appreciate
and
to
understand
many
things
which
we
either
could
not
previously
have
hoped
to
understand
or
which
we
had
been
looking
at
with
half-open
eyes
He
enhances
our
sense
not
only
of
the
poets
universe
the
cosmology
of
Dante
and
Milton
for
example
but
also
of
the
symbolism
used
by
painters
and
architects
The
past
is
still
a
foreign
country
but
we
have
been
shown
round
it
by
the
most
genial
and
expert
of
guides
Such
basic
matters
as
what
people
believed
about
their
own
bodies
made
up
of
humours
or
their
pasts
are
juxtaposed
with
fascinating
excursions
into
such
areas
of
belief
as
the
fairies
and
mythical
beasts
The
range
of
reading
and
reference
is
prodigious
Almost
the
most
enjoyable
thing
of
all
is
Lewis's
ability
to
find
traces
of
the
old
world
beliefs
which
go
back
to
Isadore
of
Seville
or
Macrobius
or
even
as
far
as
Plato
surviving
in
the
pages
of
Fielding
Johnson
or
Wordsworth
In
The
Discarded
Image
his
omnivorous
reading
taste
is
best
synthesized

BERTOLT
BRECHT
They
left
London
for
Chipping
Campden
by
train
on
March
in
the
company
of
a
toy
Pekinese
newly
bought
by
Greene
for
Vivien
They
had
seen
one
some
months
earlier
a
puppy
of
fourteen
weeks
with
a
beautiful
smoky
fur
belonging
to
Raymond's
wife
Charlotte
the
Raymond
Greenes
were
then
living
in
Oxford
where
Raymond
had
a
medical
practice
and
this
led
Greene
to
buy
one
According
to
him
the
puppy
behaved
like
an
angel
on
the
journey
though
he
observed
characteristically
that
it
was
sleeping
uneasily
and
snoring

Letter
to
his
mother
March
It
was
to
have
a
short
life
and
a
rather
tragic
end
They
had
been
ready
at
a.m
for
the
furniture
removers
but
the
van
was
an
hour
late
and
in
fact
did
not
reach
the
cottage
until
p.m
so
that
the
unloading
of
the
furniture
had
to
be
done
by
the
light
of
borrowed
lamps
Moreover
the
curtains
had
not
arrived
and
the
lino
had
not
been
laid
They
gave
up
the
idea
of
spending
the
night
there
boarded
the
dog
out
and
went
to
an
hotel
Greene
remembered
mice
running
up
and
down
in
the
wainscoting
and
the
dying
coals
in
the
grate
fluttered
like
bats
Ibid
an
image
usually
indicating
anxiety
on
his
part
The
next
day
Vivien
got
down
to
staining
the
cottage
floor
with
Greene
crouched
in
a
corner
out
of
the
way
reading
True
they
had
substantially
reduced
their
expenses
by
moving
the
cottage
cost
only
a
week
but
they
had
also
dramatically
reduced
their
standard
of
living
and
quality
of
life
Chipping
Campden
some
miles
north
of
Oxford
and
situated
in
the
Cotswold
Hills
was
a
very
old
market
town
Its
name
derives
from
Old
English
meaning
a
market
town
in
a
valley
of
camps
It
was
built
of
local
stone
and
even
the
public
telephone
box
in
the
town
square
had
the
stone's
colouring
to
make
it
blend
in
There
was
a
quality
of
stillness
which
persists
today
of
light
the
sound
of
church
bells
and
the
smell
of
jam-making
and
inns
with
names
like
Live
and
Let
Live
The
cottage
Little
Orchard
was
up
a
short
street
called
Mud
Lane
at
the
end
of
the
High
Street
At
the
bottom
of
Mud
Lane
was
a
pump
said
to
be
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
a
dancing
bear
During
their
first
night
in
the
cottage
they
discovered
that
the
Aladdin
paraffin
lamps
smoked
when
left
alone
for
a
few
minutes
and
they
spent
a
disturbed
night
They
missed
the
sound
of
traffic
and
were
kept
awake
by
the
hooting
of
an
owl
in
the
darkness
Greene
wrote
to
his
mother
I
have
little
news
in
this
dim
and
distant
spot
and
their
isolation
clearly
troubled
him
He
warned
his
mother
that
he
might
kidnap
her
to
stay
with
them
though
his
plan
was
to
live
at
Chipping
Campden
only
one
year
and
to
buy
a
two-seater
car
and
learn
to
drive
which
he
never
did
His
letters
to
his
mother
suggest
that
Vivien
liked
Chipping
Campden
or
at
any
rate
was
making
the
best
of
it
and
moving
into
local
society

letter
to
Hugh
Greene
the
date
on

read
but
is
probably
April
To
his
mother
Greene
wrote
Hugh
and
I
did
a
long
walk
to
Stow-in-the-Wold
I
won
more
than
off
him
at
Rockaway
We
were
woke
on
the
first
night
by
hearing
him
being
sick
out
of
the
window
We
think
it
was
the
cider
he
had
for
supper
after
the
railway
journey
The
Peke
was
being
sick
at
about
the
same
time
as
Hugh
Letter
to
his
mother
April
This
letter
was
written
on
April
the
day
after
he
finished
the
new
novel
the
first
version
anyway
a
long
book
over
words
his
previous
one
had
been
just
under
It
had
taken
him
seven
months
to
reach
this
point
The
novel
was
begun
in
September
in
London
but
the
pressure
on
him
to
produce
a
novel
had
led
to
his
writing
words
this
month
April
in
spite
of
the
move
I've
been
working
too
hard
he
told
his
mother
He
thought
of
a
singularly
unsuitable
title
The
Phantom
in
the
Hair
taken
from
an
undistinguished
poem
by
Coventry
Patmore
By
the
time
the
proofs
came
to
him
in
mid-August
he
still
had
not
found
a
satisfactory
title
and
in
some
desperation
chose
one
previously
put
forward
by
his
publisher
for
his
preceding
novel
a
suggestion
he
had
not
then
taken
up
Rumour
at
Nightfall
As
a
full-time
writer
he
took
to
going
on
long
walks
possibly
to
work
off
his
energy
no
doubt
to
think
of
his
work
and
perhaps
as
a
means
of
escape
from
work
and
the
cramped
conditions
at
Little
Orchard
He
walked
with
Vivien
though
she
being
much
shorter
must
have
had
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
his
long-legged
strides
We
used
to
go
for
tremendous
walks
tremendous
for
me
Graham
would
work
in
the
mornings
in
a
pathetic
little
study
rather
cold
upstairs
Then
in
the
afternoon
he'd
go
for
long
walks
and
sometimes
I'd
go
with
him
He's
a
tremendous
walker
and
very
fast
And
I
remember
his
noting
snow
on
a
hill
or
a
wonderful
tree
or
something
and
I
wasn't
responsive
and
he
bent
down
and
said
But
you
can't
see
over
the
hedge
Interview
with
Vivien
Greene
July
Sometimes
Greene
would
go
off
on
his
long
hops
and
Vivien
would
travel
by
bus
or
train
to
his
destination
then
they
would
spend
the
night
together
in
a
pub
or
small
hotel
and
return
He

walk

spending
a

way
Letter
to
his
mother
March
But
his
favourite
walking
companion
was
always
Hugh
though
in
later
years
it
was
mostly
for
visits
to
secondhand
bookshops
Alas
not
now
since
Sir
Hugh
died
in
But
he
was
also
perfectly
happy
with
his
own
company
and
gives
the
impression
of
being
something
of
a
Wordsworthian
solitary
Whenever
he
had
reached
a
point
when
he
could
not
continue
with
a
novel
or
had
completed
one
he
would
go
on
a
tramp
After
Woodstock
I
went
to
Stow-on-the-Wold
a
lovely
barren
little
place
The
next
day
I
did
a
long
stretch
along
the
top
of
the
Cotswolds
of
over
so
miles
to
Tewkesbury
and
the
next
day
I
went
down
to
Gloucester
I'm
rapidly

this

he
told
his
mother
Ibid
May
He
had
taken
the
risk
of
giving
up
a
secure
and
promising
career
with
The
Times
the
risk
of
accepting
a
salary
from
his
publishers
on
the
understanding
that
he
would
produce
saleable
novels
the
risk
financially
forced
on
him
of
removing
himself
from
the
London
literary
scene
and
into
the
country
He
was
to
take
yet
another
but
more
inexplicable
risk
In
he
had
begun
writing
the
biography
of
John
Wilmot
the
second
Earl
of
Rochester
who
was
born
on
to
April
and
died
at
the
age
of
thirty-three
Wilmot
was
a
dissolute
courtier
at
the
Restoration
court
of
Charles
II
a
lecher
and
a
drunk
but
also
a
poet
who
could
treat
himself
and
his
world
with
satiric
coolness
and
who
helped
to
establish
the
tradition
of
English
satiric
verse
and
assisted
Dryden
in
the
writing
of
Marriage-a-la-Mode
He
anticipated
Swift
in
his
Satyr
Against
Mankind
with
its
scathing
denunciation
of
rationalism
and
optimism
contrasting
human
perfidy
and
the
instinctive
wisdom
of
the
animal
world
He
wrote
to
his
friend
Henry
Savile
Most
human
affairs
are
carried
on
at
the
same
nonsensical
rate
which
makes
me
think
it
a
fault
to
laugh
at
the
monkey
we
have
here
when
I
compare
his
condition
with
mankind
He
was
to
turn
to
Catholicism
and
make
a
death-bed
repentance
In
a
pencilled
note
to
his
mother
on
September
Greene
wrote
I
did
a
little
work

Letter
to
Hugh
Greene
November
His
commitment
to
the
research
involved
was
serious
even
while
he
was
revising
the
first
draft
of
Rumour
at
Nightfall
he
was
working
on
the
biography
He
wrote
to
Vivien
from
the
British
Museum
in
early
June
again
waiting
for
books
to
be
brought
to
him
I'm
going
to

rewarding
myself
for
several
minor
discoveries
here

and
ended
his
short
note

He
was
within
walking
distance
for
him
from
Chipping
Campden
to
Rochester's
birthplace
and
place
of
burial
and
in
the
same
June
he
set
off
I
went
off
walking
Wednesday
and
Thursday
spending
Wednesday
at
Chipping
Norton
and
visiting
Spelsbury
where
the
Rochesters
are
buried
and
Adderbury
where
his
country
house
remains
He
was
following
the
route
taken
by
the
Parliamentary
Army
during
the
Civil
War
over
the
final
ridge
of
the
Cotswolds
to
Chipping
Norton
and
his
personal
experience
of
this
journey
appears
in
the
opening
of
his
biography
the
level
wash
of
fields
divided
by
grey
walls
lapping
round
the
small
church
and
rising
to
the
height
of
the
gravestones
in
a
foam
of
nettles
before
dwindling
out
against
the
black
rise
of
Wychwood
A

ancient

Letter
to
his
mother
June
The
proofs
of
Rumour
at
Nightfall
arrived
in
August
and
he
hurried
through
them
hoping
that
Heinemann
would
publish
the
novel
in
September
but
it
was
to
be
October
or
November
Waiting
he
worked
on
the
Rochester

suffering
from
hay
fever
and
asthma
It's
very
asthmatic
this

he
wrote
to
his
mother
Could
you
let
me

But
he
worked
on
doing
his
words
a
day
until
he
had
finished

It
was
to
be
rejected

Towards

PICASSO
keeps
taking
me
to
the
Rotonde
the
rising
young
poet
Jean
Cocteau
wrote
to
a
friend
in
Gloves
cane
and
collar
astonish
these
artists
in
shirt-sleeves
they
have
always
looked
on
them
as
the
insignia
of
feeble-mindedness
still
it's
great
to
be
in
the
thick
of
the
dog-fights
of
great
art
That
year
the
twenty-five-year-old
Cocteau
was
working
on
the
book
of
Parade
Diaghilev's
controversial
new
ballet
which
was
to
express
the
new
spirit
in
the
arts
with
music
by
Satie
and
Cubist
costumes
and
sets
by
Picasso
I
was
on
my
way
towards
the
intense
life
wrote
Cocteau
towards
Picasso
towards
Modigliani
towards
Satie
A
rising
star
Cocteau
was
very
much
the
dandy
full
of
elegance
and
highly
conscious
of
the
impression
he
made
So
aware
of
the
internationalism
of
art
he
told
the
story
himself
that
when
a
journalist
asked
him
who
the
great
French
artists
were
he
replied
Why
Picasso
Modigliani
Lipchitz
Stravinsky
a
Spaniard
an
Italian
and
two
Russians
Cocteau
would
have
been
delighted
to
introduce
Modigliani
to
his
world
of
the
new
couturiers
and
of
Diaghilev's
Ballets
Russes
to
help
him
to
become
a
fashionable
and
popular
portrait
painter
And
apparently
he
did
try
But
with
his
damnable
purity
which
they
all
praised
after
his
death
Modigliani
insisted
on
going
his
own
way
He
despised
what
he
called
the
snobs
d'art
and
all
the
high-falutin
discussion
of
art
We
working
artists
suffer
from
them
he
once
told
Epstein
He
was
still
seen
intermittently
with
the
bizarre
Englishwoman
but
by
the
love
affair
was
effectively
over
For
both
Beatrice
and
Modigliani
it
had
been
a
glorious
adventure
at
first
the
excitement
of
the
sexual
encounters
heightened
by
intellectual
friction
But
their
feelings
for
each
other
had
been
irreparably
damaged
by
the
brawls
and
fights
and
the
recriminations
afterwards
Now
Modigliani
was
living
and
working
in
his
own
place
producing
about
four
paintings
a
month
By
his
paintings
were
to
fetch
the
highest
prices
during
his
lifetime
and
in
that
year
he
is
credited
with
painting
one
hundred
and
twenty-five
canvases
a
painting
every
three
days
But
his
daughter
implies
that
the
high
prices
paid
for
work
executed
after
may
have
affected
the
chronology
That
seems
extremely
likely
as
although
he
worked
rapidly
all
Modigliani's
models
speak
of
two-
or
three-day
sittings
Of
course
when
he
was
living
with
Beatrice
and
he
painted
her
at
least
fourteen
times
he
could
resume
his
sittings
more
or
less
at
will
By
Kisling
who
had
served
in
the
French
Foreign
Legion
was
discharged
wounded
and
working
at
his
studio
No
Rue
Joseph
Bara
and
Modigliani
often
worked
there
with
him
An
easygoing
good-natured
man
Kisling
had
a
strong
constitution
and
enjoyed
the
bohemian
life
of
chance
romances
shindigs
drinking
parties
sing-songs
brawls
and
wordy
discussions
unclouded
by
guilt
or
ill-health
Whatever
time
he
went
to
bed
Kisling
was
at
his
easel
working
early
next
morning
painting
agreeable
nostalgic
portraits
of
women
Kisling
adored
women
and
had
an
easy
way
with
them
his
face
alive
with
sexual
vitality
Never
desperately
short
of
money
he
was
lucky
in
attracting
funds
and
spent
his
money
generously
One
day
when
he
had
sold
a
painting
for
a
hundred
francs
he
spent
it
all
on
buying
flowers
for
every
woman
who
passed
by
in
the
street
in
a
gesture
that
Modi
much
admired
However
when
he
invited
Beatrice
Hastings
to
come
and
model
for
him
nude
early
on
in
their
affair
Modigliani
objected
and
she
failed
to
keep
the
appointment
This
happened
twice
When
Kisling
asked
Beatrice
why
she
had
not
turned
up
Modigliani
replied
I
am
responsible
If
a
woman
poses
for
you
she
gives
herself
to
you
Kisling
allowed
Modigliani
to
use
his
studio
often
lent
him
brushes
and
paints
and
behaved
with
a
careless
generosity
towards
him
but
the
two
men
were
too
different
in
temperament
to
become
intimate
friends
Modigliani
appreciated
Kisling
for
what
he
was
a
sweet-natured
high-spirited
sensual
young
man
Jean
Cocteau
came
to
Kisling's
studio
to
have
his
portrait
painted
and
Kisling
and
Modigliani
both
painted
him
side
by
side
No
doubt
Picasso
had
advised
Kisling
of
Modigliani's
talent
Pierre
Reverdy
the
poet
sat
in
the
large
studio
watching
the
artists
at
work
Cocteau
would
not
stop
talking
He
kept
up
a
non-stop
stream
of
words
against
the
patter
of
the
raindrops
beating
against
the
skylight
to
Modigliani's
silent
exasperation
In
Kisling's
studio
where
there
was
always
a
bottle
or
two
open
Modigliani
wrote
on
one
of
the
preparatory
pencil
sketches
that
he
made
I
the
undersigned
author
of
the
drawing
swear
never
to
get
drunk
again
for
the
duration
of
the
war
In
Kisling's
portrait
Cocteau
appears
as
a
small
sensitive
dreaming
figure
almost
lost
in
the
large
room
with
its
chairs
and
table
open
window
blue
sky
and
a
cat
Whereas
Modigliani
cut
out
all
extraneous
detail
and
painted
Cocteau
in
a
high-backed
chair
looking
every
inch
a
peacock
angular
and
dominant
When
he
saw
the
finished
portrait
Cocteau
was
shaken
and
described
it
privately
as
diabolical
The
painting
was
proof
he
said
that
Modigliani
detested
him
Cocteau
was
acute
yet
the
exaggerated
portrait
had
a
curiously
prophetic
quality
By
when
Cocteau
was
a
man
in
his
sixties
he
had
grown
to
have
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
the
painting
Despite
the
unspoken
antipathy
he
felt
Modigliani
was
reluctant
to
accept
a
fee
for
the
painting
When
Cocteau
insisted
Modigliani
stipulated
his
price
five
francs
The
canvas
was
too
large
for
Cocteau
to
carry
and
since
he
did
not
have
the
cash
to
hire
a
fiacre
the
painting
remained
at
the
Rotonde
for
years
Modigliani's
paintings
always
reveal
what
the
painter
thought
of
his
model
In
the
majority
of
his
work
he
displays
a
sympathy
which
reaches
to
the
inner
core
of
his
subject
But
Modigliani
found
Cocteau
unbearably
pretentious
a
name-dropper
with
an
instinct
for
self-advertisement
Possibly
Cocteau's
exaggerated
precious
manner
made
Modigliani
feel
threatened
in
his
own
sexuality
Although
he
was
plainly
heterosexual
he
had
an
unusually
sensitive
almost
feminine
side
to
his
nature
And
then
again
perhaps
Modigliani's
exasperation
stemmed
in
part
from
envy
of
this
brilliant
young
man
By
deliberately
turning
his
back
on
the
new
spirit
in
art
Modigliani
found
himself
excluded
from
most
of
the
excitement
and
gaiety
in
the
arts
that
flourished
in
spite
of
the
war
Picasso
and
Matisse
sponsored
a
Granados-Satie
concert
in
a
very
fashionable
occasion
with
a
select
audience
Later
in
the
year
when
the
poet
Apollinaire
came
back
from
the
war
with
a
head
wound
a
grand
banquet
was
held
in
his
honour
at
the
Palais
d'Orl
ans
in
the
Boulevard
du
Maine
Ninety
guests
including
Andr
Gide
Picasso
Max
Jacob
Matisse
Vlaminck
and
Cocteau
sat
down
to
a
meal
of
fantasy
The
twelve
courses
included
Hors
d'oeuvres
cubistes
orphistes
futuristes
M
ditations
esth
tiques
en
salade
Caf
des
Soir
es
de
Paris
and
Alcools
The
evening
ended
in
a
brawl
between
the
different
factions
in
Cubism
but
it
brought
a
moment
of
splendour
into
the
blackouts
and
bombings
of
war
Yet
Modigliani
was
too
much
a
part
of
the
life
of
Montparnasse
too
involved
with
the
individuals
leading
the
new
art
to
remain
completely
aloof
In
he
had
met
Hans
Arp
the
French
painter
who
was
to
become
prominent
in
the
new
Dada
movement
at
the
artists
canteen
in
the
Avenue
du
Maine
Two
years
later
Arp
was
living
in
Zurich
a
member
of
a
group
of
talented
migr
artists
who
had
left
their
own
countries
because
of
the
war
Through
casual
meetings
at
caf
s
the
artists
drew
together
to
form
a
movement
in
protest
against
the
waste
of
war
against
nationalism
and
against
everything
pompous
conventional
or
boring
in
the
art
of
the
Western
world
Since
they
held
the
bourgeois
responsible
for
the
war
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
shock
In
New
York
Duchamps
provided
the
Mona
Lisa
with
a
moustache
and
Picabia
painted
absurd
machines
that
mocked
technology
and
efficiency
But
it
was
in
Zurich
that
the
first
shot
was
fired
The
Dadaists
a
nonsense
name
chosen
at
random
evolved
the
idea
of
a
miniature
variety
show
and
held
their
first
show
in
a
little
bar
the
Cabaret
Voltaire
Hugo
Ball
a
German
actor
and
playwright
Hans
Arp
Tristan
Tzara
and
Marcel
Janco
a
poet
and
artist
from
Rumania
and
Richard
Huselsenbeck
a
German
poet
were
the
leaders
of
Dada
We
wanted
to
make
the
Cabaret
Voltaire
a
focal
point
of
the
newest
art
although
we
did
not
neglect
from
time
to
time
to
tell
the
fat
and
utterly
uncomprehending
Zurich
philistines
that
we
regarded
them
as
pigs
and
the
German
Kaiser
as
the
initiator
of
the
war
The
Cabaret
Voltaire
group
were
all
artists
in
the
sense
that
they
were
keenly
sensitive
to
newly
developed
artistic
possibilities
In
that
period
as
we
danced
sang
and
recited
night
after
night
in
the
Cabaret
Voltaire
abstract
art
was
for
us
tantamount
to
absolute
honour
Naturalism
was
a
psychological
penetration
of
the
motives
of
the
bourgeois
in
whom
we
saw
our
mortal
enemy
and
psychological
penetration
despite
all
efforts
at
resistance
brings
an
identification
with
the
various
precepts
of
bourgeois
morality
Dada
was
to
be
a
rallying
point
for
abstract
energies
and
a
lasting
slingshot
for
the
great
international
artistic
movements
Modigliani
was
in
sympathy
with
the
broad
sentiments
of
the
movement
the
internationalism
the
disgust
at
the
war
and
those
who
profited
from
it
and
the
sensitivity
to
the
new
possibilities
in
art
although
the
emphasis
on
abstract
art
did
not
fit
into
his
creed
But
at
the
time
of
the
launch
of
Dada
Modigliani
was
not
clear
about
the
meaning
of
the
new
movement
and
no
one
else
seemed
to
know
With
psychological
astuteness
the
Dadaists
spoke
of
energy
and
will
and
assured
the
world
that
they
had
amazing
plans
But
concerning
the
nature
of
these
plans
no
information
was
forthcoming
When
the
Dada
brochure
Cabaret
Voltaire
was
published
in
June
it
was
a
catch-all
for
the
most
diverse
directions
in
art
which
at
that
time
seemed
to
us
to
constitute
Dada
The
cover
design
was
by
Arp
and
inside
were
contributions
from
Picasso
Kandinsky
and
Modigliani
as
well
as
the
leaders
of
the
movement
Modigliani's
contribution
was
a
portrait
of
Arp
Very
probably
he
gave
Arp
the
drawing
who
used
it
with
the
artist's
consent
His
work
was
also
shown
at
the
Dada
gallery
in
the
Cabaret
Voltaire
with
a
very
mixed
group
of
artists
including
Picasso
Arp
De
Chirico
Paul
Klee
and
Oscar
Kokoshka
For
Modigliani
it
was
important
for
his
work
to
be
seen
outside
France
in
an
international
setting
By
now
he
had
come
to
symbolize
the
Montparnasse
adventure
and
even
in
his
worst
moments
he
had
a
glamour
about
him
a
sense
of
intensity
that
excited
envy
and
admiration
Jean
Cocteau
recognized
it
although
there
was
no
personal
sympathy
between
them
and
Jean
Cocteau
was
deeply
involved
in
the
avant-garde
In
Paris
at
No
Rue
Huyghens
in
a
dingy
badly
heated
studio
which
belonged
to
a
Swiss
painter
Lejeune
modern
art
exhibitions
poetry
readings
and
performances
of
new
music
were
held
in
wartime
Paul
Guillaume
arranged
the
art
exhibitions
Sometimes
in
a
display
of
the
new
simultaneity
that
was
all
the
rage
there
would
be
a
combined
performance
of
art
poetry
reading
and
music
of
high
quality
with
a
fashionable
well-dressed
crowd
mingling
with
the
artists
Modigliani
was
among
the
painters
who
showed
their
work
at
the
studio
in
the
narrow
street
off
Boulevard
Montparnasse
in
Visitors
to
the
studio
could
gain
an
impression
of
his
work
as
a
whole
and
grasp
the
cumulative
effect

The
Public
Man
Eliot
had
arrived
in
South
Africa
by
the
time
The
Cocktail
Party
opened
in
New
York
on
January
at
the
Henry
Miller
Theatre
There
were
none
of
the
demonstrations
or
obstructions
which
he
had
feared
and
in
fact
such
was
the
success
of
the
play
that
he
was
featured
on
the
cover
of
Time
magazine
on
March
His
words
already
being
quoted
in
the
pulpit
were
also
being
used
on
Madison
Avenue
an
Esso
advertisement
in
had
had
as
its
message
Time
future
contained
in
time
past
A
cartoon
in
the
New
York
Times
in
April
showed
a
sailor
in
a
tattooing
parlour
saying
I
have
in
mind
a
couple
of
lines
by
T
S
Eliot
He
was
now
a
celebrity
When
he
arrived
in
South
Africa
a
crowd
was
waiting
at
the
dock
to
greet
him
and
on
later
visits
to
the
United
States
he
was
besieged
by
autograph
hunters
and
press
photographers
waiting
for
him
after
readings
When
he
lectured
at
Harvard
in
this
year
policemen
had
to
control
the
crowds
who
came
out
to
see
him
and
loudspeakers
were
set
up
for
those
who
could
not
get
into
the
auditorium
Katherine
Ann
Porter
has
described
how
at
one
New
York
party
the
guests
were
swarming
around
him
grabbing
him
patting
him
owning
him
trying
to
claw
each
other
away
from
him
Fame
is
a
less
brilliant
commodity
in
England
but
nevertheless
he
had
to
keep
his
address
secret
to
protect
himself
not
only
from
letters
and
telephone
calls
but
also
from
undesirable
visitors
who
might
arrive
at
Carlyle
Mansions
There
seems
to
be
a
law
in
human
behaviour
that
people
in
the
end
get
what
they
want
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
Eliot
would
not
have
acquired
the
eminence
which
he
now
enjoyed
unless
on
one
level
he
had
sought
it
he
said
in
an
address
delivered
during
this
period
that
things
sometimes
become
possible
if
we
want
them
enough
Many
observers
noticed
the
force
and
weight
of
his
presence
it
might
be
called
dedication
or
ambition
or
it
might
have
been
something
below
the
level
of
consciousness
which
propelled
him
forward
Nevertheless
if
we
examine
the
pattern
of
his
life
it
reveals
a
programmatic
aspect
and
the
steeliness
of
his
resolve
is
not
to
be
doubted
But
there
was
also
a
sense
in
which
he
despised
fame
even
as
he
obtained
it
and
when
in
this
year
he
described
Mark
Twain
as
a
man
who
wanted
success
or
reputation
and
yet
at
the
same
time
resented
their
violation
of
his
integrity
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
once
again
he
was
expressing
his
own
feelings
through
the
agency
of
another's
Already
he
was
wondering
if
his
fame
meant
that
his
writing
had
only
a
contemporary
appeal
and
he
complained
that
people
now
thought
of
him
as
a
celebrity
rather
than
as
a
poet
In
retrospect
of
course
it
is
clear
that
his
creative
powers
were
beginning
to
wane
and
that
his
real
work
had
been
done
But
there
was
also
a
growing
disaffection
among
the
younger
poets
and
critics
he
had
ceased
to
be
a
poet
and
had
become
an
institution
and
the
only
thing
to
do
with
an
institution
is
to
attempt
to
pull
it
down
He
was
compared
with
Aristides
the
Just
and
there
were
those
who
wished
a
similar
fate
for
him
One
phrase
was
repeated
as
a
joke
The
Blessed
Thomas
Eliot
Considered
as
the
Air
We
Breathe
in
the
Fifties
and
Sixties
there
would
be
many
attempts
to
dispel
that
air
and
to
place
Eliot
as
some
great
dim
figure
from
the
past
He
was
a
relatively
wealthy
man
his
annual
income
from
both
his
publishing
salary
and
his
royalties
was
approximately
and
in
the
early
months
of
this
year
his
income
from
the
New
York
production
of
The
Cocktail
Party
was
estimated
at
about
per
week
this
was
no
doubt
why
in
June
he
was
looking
for
an
accountant
At
his
death
he
left
Wealth
did
not
make
him
lavish
however
he
had
always
been
careful
about
money
indeed
he
was
economical
in
all
areas
of
life
even
in
small
matters
such
as
ensuring
that
all
the
tea
in
a
tea-pot
had
actually
been
drunk
and
Joseph
Chiari
has
remembered
how
he
kept
a
regular
account
of
his
expenses
in
a
pocket
notebook
One
friend
has
explained
how
in
a
conversation
in
which
she
was
lamenting
the
cost
of
electricity
Eliot
asked
her
in
a
confidential
manner
Are
you
on
the
domestic
tariff
He
was
nothing
if
not
practical
in
his
dealings
with
the
world
he
insisted
on
proper
fees
for
the
republication
of
his
essays
for
example
and
used
to
advise
friends
like
Herbert
Read
on
the
amount
they
should
charge
for
a
lecture
tour
But
if
he
was
scrupulously
careful
about
his
own
expenditure
he
was
generous
to
other
poets
and
writers
He
underwrote
a
loss
of
on
Ronald
Duncan's
play
Stratton
but
only
on
condition
that
Duncan
was
not
told
And
when
in
Wyndham
Lewis
completed
his
portrait
of
him
Eliot
quietly
paid
Lewis
more
than
the
agreed
price
He
later
made
it
clear
that
he
did
not
wish
the
letters
revealing
his
generosity
to
be
published
Then
in
the
following
year
he
gave
Lewis
to
finance
a
trip
to
Sweden
where
he
was
to
receive
X-ray
treatment
for
his
deteriorating
eyesight
His
secrecy
abut
his
own
generosity
makes
it
very
difficult
to
document
in
full
certainly
during
the
years
of
the
Second
World
War
he
gave
money
to
Dylan
Thomas
and
Roy
Campbell
but
many
other
such
instances
may
have
gone
unrecorded
After
a
spring
and
summer
during
which
he
was
so
busy
with
his
ordinary
duties
that
he
had
no
time
to
himself
at
all
not
even
his
evenings
he
returned
again
to
America
in
the
late
autumn
of
These
trips
to
the
United
States
were
to
become
a
regular
event
part
of
his
routine
as
it
were
and
there
was
a
sense
in
which
he
was
returning
home
He
spent
one
night
in
New
York
and
then
nursing
a
cold
which
he
had
contracted
on
the
boat
he
went
straight
to
Boston
with
his
relatives
in
particular
his
two
sisters
and
his
late
brother's
family
and
with
old
friends
like
Emily
Hale
and
Djuna
Barnes
he
could
still
enjoy
an
affectionate
intimacy
which
he
seemed
to
lack
in
England
Willa
Muir
saw
him
in
America
and
observed
Tom
Eliot
is
much
more
human
here
than
in
England
He
was
less
cautious
smiling
more
easily
spontaneous
in
repartee
enjoying
the
teasing
he
was
getting
from
Djuna
In
her
company
he
seemed
to
have
shed
some
English
drilling
and
become
more
American
And
yet
even
to
his
relatives
he
must
have
seemed
still
in
part
a
foreigner
with
his
accent
and
his
clothes
that
was
an
aspect
of
his
loneliness
never
to
be
completely
at
home
anywhere
In
a
preface
to
The
Adventures
of
Huckleberry
Finn
published
in
this
year
he
described
the
landscape
of
his
childhood
and
speculated
about
the
boy
who
remained
within
the
adult
and
successful
figure
of
Mark
Twain
the
boy
who
was
called
Huck
itself
it
was
impossible
for
that
boy
or
that
river
to
have
a
beginning
or
end
a
career
In
America
and
in
his
memories
of
a
life
still
to
be
wished
for
although
lost
and
gone
for
ever
that
boy
could
be
glimpsed
in
Eliot
also
But
he
was
still
very
much
a
public
man
and
to
pay
for
his
visit
he
had
agreed
to
give
a
limited
number
of
addresses
and
readings
At
the
University
of
Chicago
he
gave
four
lectures
in
November
on
The
Aims
of
Education
and
in
the
same
month
talked
on
At
the
beginning
of
the
previous
month
he
had
given
a
reading
in
New
York
where
one
observer
described
him
as
a
hot
ticket
Lecturing
was
now
easier
for
him
than
it
once
had
been
he
had
after
all
accumulated
a
great
deal
of
experience
but
the
readings
of
his
own
poetry
frequently
left
him
exhausted
Robert
Giroux
has
recalled
how
in
advance
of
such
occasions
Eliot
was
as
nervous
as
a
cat
but
that
when
he
had
begun
a
great
calm
descended
upon
him
He
was
now
a
very
effective
reader
of
his
own
work
his
theatrical
instincts
were
here
most
valuable
and
as
Edmund
Wilson
noted
he
could
communicate
a
feeling
of
intense
excitement
to
his
audiences
The
lectures
which
he
delivered
in
America
on
this
visit
are
not
of
crucial
critical
significance
and
like
other
addresses
of
the
same
period
they
are
chiefly
remarkable
for
the
fact
that
he
felt
able
to
talk
at
some
length
about
himself
and
his
work
as
if
he
realized
that
audiences
came
to
see
him
rather
than
hear
anything
he
might
care
to
say
He
described
his
childhood
in
America
his
experiences
as
a
teacher
his
work
as
a
publisher
his
poetic
development
and
his
progress
in
the
drama
He
also
admitted
the
faults
in
his
writing
something
which
the
Eliot
of
earlier
years
would
never
have
been
able
to
do
in
public
at
least
In
his
Chicago
lectures
for
example
he
described
how
certain
passages
of
Notes
toward
the
Definition
of
Culture
had
been
exposed
as
a
mass
of
contradictions
and
at
the
end
he
also
made
a
rueful
disclaimer
I
am
quite
aware
that
I
have
been
trying
to
persuade
although
I
may
not
be
quite
sure
of
what
In
fact
these
lectures
offered
an
elegant
and
lucid
exposition
of
educational
theories
and
assumptions
he
had
been
exercised
by
this
topic
since
the
early
forties
and
although
he
failed
to
arrive
at
any
conclusions
he
suggested
that
none
could
in
any
case
be
reached
He
told
George
Seferis
that
in
his
prose
writings
the
need
for
honesty
and
clarity
entailed
the
kind
of
elaborate
elucidation
which
audiences
found
dull
but
this
was
now
the
manner
that
Eliot
adopted
and
it
is
possible
to
see
the
equivocations
and
hesitations
of
his
later
prose
work
as
aspects
of
what
was
essentially
a
Socratic
method
of
inquiry
rather
than
an
expression
of
caution
or
indecision
When
he
returned
to
England
in
the
middle
of
December
the
winter
again
affected
him
he
contracted
bronchitis
ten
days
after
his
arrival
and
suffered
a
further
three
attacks
during
January
He
stayed
at
home
for
part
of
that
month
and
his
doctor
advised
him
to
restrict
his
engagements
as
much
as
possible
He
was
well
enough
in
February
however
to
attend
a
poetry
reading
at
the
Institute
of
Contemporary
Arts
but
it
was
not
a
pleasant
occasion
Apparently
without
Eliot
having
been
warned
the
poet
Emmanuel
Litvinoff
read
a
poem
which
attacked
his
attitude
towards
the
Jews
At
the
end
of
the
reading
there
was
some
consternation
but
Eliot
who
was
sitting
at
the
back
of
the
room
was
heard
to
mutter
It's
a
good
poem
it's
a
very
good
poem
The
incident
was
reported
in
the
press
however
and
his
secretary
was
quoted
in
one
newspaper
as
saying
Many
Jewish
people
have
written
to
him
accusing
him
of
anti-semitism
It
is
not
true
Since
it
is
the
charge
still
most
frequently
levelled
against
him
it
is
perhaps
worth
examining
the
evidence
for
it
In
his
published
writings
there
are
two
egregious
instances
the
line
The
Jew
is
underneath
the
lot
in
Burbank
with
a
Baedeker
Bleistein
with
a
Cigar
and
the
reference
to
the
undesirability
of
a
large
number
of
free-thinking
Jews
in
After
Strange
Gods
In
his
unpublished
correspondence
there
are
four
references
In
a
letter
to
Herbert
Read
dated
February
probably
written
in
he
described
a
racial
prejudice
from
which
he
was
not
immune
although
he
did
not
specify
that
prejudice
its
nature
is
clear
from
the
context
in
which
he
offered
Disraeli
as
an
example
of
what
he
meant
Finally
in
a
letter
to
Bonamy
Dobr
e
dated
by
Dobr
e
about
March
he
made
a
number
of
supercilious
remarks
about
the
Jews
All
the
available
evidence
suggests
then
that
on
occasions
he
made
what
were
then
fashionably
anti-semitic
remarks
to
his
close
friends
Leonard
Woolf
himself
a
Jew
has
said
I
think
T
S
Eliot
was
slightly
anti-semitic
in
the
sort
of
vague
way
which
is
not
uncommon
He
would
have
denied
it
quite
genuinely
which
suggests
Eliot's
ability
to
seem
quite
different
to
different
people
But
there
is
one
further
distinction
which
needs
to
be
made
He
was
drawn
to
the
traditions
of
Sephardism
he
had
once
explained
that
rigorous
and
secluded
tradition
appealed
to
his
own
sensibility
in
the
same
way
that
free-thinking
Jews
seemed
to
him
to
come
too
close
to
the
rational
Unitarianism
which
he
despised
On
a
less
theoretical
level
it
is
also
true
that
his
expressions
of
anti-semitism
occur
in
the
Twenties
or
just
before
when
he
was
inclined
to
make
misogynistic
remarks
also
it
was
a
period
when
his
own
personality
threatened
to
break
apart
and
it
seems
likely
that
his
distrust
of
Jews
and
women
was
the
sign
of
an
uneasy
and
vulnerable
temperament
in
which
aggression
and
insecurity
were
compounded
This
is
an
explanation
however
and
not
a
justification

The
examination
of
Robin's
PhD
thesis
on
the
logical
foundations
of
physics
had
to
be
postponed
since
Stephen
Toulmin
the
philosopher
of
science
had
decided
he
could
not
undertake
it
after
all
Early
in
Alan
wrote
to
Robin
They
have
at
last
found
someone
to
referee
your
thesis
viz
Braithwaite
I
think
it
would
be
best
if
we
had
the
oral
at
Cambridge
and
am
writing
to
Braithwaite
to
suggest
this
Have
had
another
go
at
the
Unity
of
Science
essay
This
was
a
prize
essay
that
Robin
was
submitting
to
the
Unity
of
Science
journal
concerned
with
the
same
subject
I
think
the
duplicate
types
might
be
quite
important
Don't
they
answer
the
question
about
What
is
Time
I
was
amused
about
inpenetrability
at
first
I
thought
it
was
a
reference
to
Through
the
Looking
Glass
where
Humpty
Dumpty
says
Inpenetrability
That's
what
I
say
FDT
But
on
looking
up
the
reference
thought
probably
not
This
letter
was
rendered
not
very
effectively
as
part
of
the
computer
printout
Even
so
it
was
more
easily
legible
than
the
message
he
once
sent
to
David
Champernowne
which
simply
consisted
of
a
piece
of
teleprinter
tape
It
had
his
friend
spending
hours
on
breaking
the
Baudot
code
Alan
had
proposed
having
the
oral
in
March
but
this
did
not
suit
Robin
who
had
arranged
to
go
skiing
in
Austria
Alan
wrote
Sorry
it
really
isn't
possible
to
make
your
oral
any
earlier
Braithwaite
won't
have
read
it
before
the
very
end
of
March
If
you
really
are
going
skiing
no
doubt
it
could
be
delayed
till
April
or
May
though
I
may
have
forgotten
about
it
by
then
mostly
Your
last
letter
arrived
in
the
middle
of
a
crisis
about
Den
Norske
Gutt
so
I
have
not
been
able
to
give
my
attention
yet
to
the
really
vital
part
about
theory
of
perception
The
nature
of
this
crisis
was
partly
revealed
by
another
letter
dated
March
My
dear
Robin
I
am
going
to
try
and
stop
your
journey
to
Austria
by
informing
the
immigration
authorities
of
the
following
facts:-
i
That
although
you
have
the
permission
of
your
mother
the
countersignature
of
the
mayor
of
Leicester
is
a
forgery
executed
by
one
of
Strauss's
patients
E.B
Strauss
the
Jungian
psychoanalyst
whom
Robin
had
known
for
a
long
time
ii
That
the
skiing
expedition
is
a
blind
and
that
you
are
really
being
exported
to
satisfy
the
lusts
of
La
Contessa
Addis
Abbabisci
A
reference
to
an
incident
in
Robin's
boyhood
when
the
exiled
Emperor
of
Abyssinia
had
resided
near
his
home
and
had
invited
Robin
and
his
mother
to
tea
the
pope's
mistress-in-chief
who
fell
in
love
with
you
when
you
visited
the
opera
in
Naples
iii
That
you
are
a
heretic
with
allegiances
to
the
church
of
Princeton
and
the
hall
of
Kings
Any
of
these
grounds
should
be
adequate
I
think
If
in
spite
of
all
they
let
you
in
I
hope
you
have
a
good
holiday
I'll
leave
it
to
Braithwaite
now
to
start
arranging
another
date
for
oral
I
may
visit
Cambridge
towards
end
of
March
anyway
The
Kjell
crisis
has
now
evaporated
It
was
very
active
for
about
a
week
It
started
by
my
getting
a
p.c
from
him
saying
he
was
on
his
way
to
visit
me
At
one
stage
police
over
the
N
of
England
were
out
searching
for
him
especially
in
Wilmslow
Manchester
Newcastle
etc
I
will
tell
you
all
one
day
He
is
now
back
in
Bergen
without
my
even
seeing
him!
For
sheer
incident
it
almost
rivals
the
Arnold
story
Alan
spoke
of
this
crisis
in
the
computer
laboratory
to
Norman
Routledge
and
to
Nick
Furbank
with
whom
he
stayed
briefly
at
the
end
of
March
while
attending
a
conference
on
computers
This
was
a
symposium
on
Automatic
Digital
Computation
held
at
the
NPL
from
to
March
AMT
gave
no
talk
Notes
made
by
Mike
Woodger
show
that
he
commented
on
applications
of
computers
to
pure
mathematics
after
a
talk
by
J
C
P
Miller
of
Cambridge
mainly
on
the
zeta
function
but
also
mentioning
problems
in
algebraic
topology
at
the
NPL
But
he
never
told
all
dismissing
the
story
as
another
absurd
police
folly
There
was
a
postscript
to
his
letter
to
Robin
Is
the
beginning
of
this
letter
whimsical
or
what
a
question
he
did
not
answer
Nor
did
Robin
look
for
an
answer
his
own
reply
responded
subtly
to
the
news
of
a
crisis
by
recommending
the
novels
of
Denton
Welch
involving
his
own
house
being
under
watch
It
did
not
occur
to
those
whom
he
told
that
there
was
a
different
kind
of
explanation
for
what
had
happened
His
letter
to
Robin
said
no
more
and
passed
on
to
other
concerns
I've
got
a
shocking
tendency
at
present
to
fritter
my
time
away
in
anything
but
what
I
ought
to
be
doing
I
thought
I'd
found
the
reason
for
all
this
but
that
hasn't
made
things
much
better
One
thing
I've
done
is
to
rig
the
room
next
to
the
bathroom
up
as
electrical
lab
Am
not
doing
very
well
over
your
vision
model
In
this
laboratory
he
was
able
to
do
desert
island
experiments
of
an
electrolytic
kind
using
current
from
the
electricity
mains
supply
He
would
use
coke
as
electrodes
saying
that
using
carbon
sticks
from
old
batteries
was
a
form
of
cheating
and
weed
juice
as
a
source
of
oxygen
He
liked
to
see
how
many
chemicals
he
could
produce
starting
from
common
substances
like
salt
much
as
he
would
have
done
at
Dinard
if
his
mother
had
allowed
it
The
room
he
used
was
in
fact
a
small
space
left
in
the
middle
of
the
house
when
the
bathroom
had
been
carved
out
of
a
larger
room
He
called
it
the
nightmare
room
playing
on
Mrs
Turing's
fears
of
an
accident
Alan's
letter
also
explained
that
he
Went
down
to
Sherborne
to
lecture
to
some
boys
on
computers
Really
quite
a
treat
in
many
ways
They
were
so
luscious
and
so
well
mannered
with
a
little
dash
of
pertness
and
Sherborne
itself
quite
unspoilt
His
schooldays
might
well
have
seemed
simple
and
safe
in
comparison
with
the
world
in
which
he
now
waited
for
the
next
turn
of
the
screw
This
visit
had
been
on
March
and
in
his
talk
to
the
science
society
The
Shirburnian
Mr
Turing
made
a
very
clear
analogy
between
a
stupid
clerk
with
his
mechanical
calculating
device
paper
to
write
his
workings
on
and
his
instructions
and
the
electronic
brain
which
combined
all
these
in
one
All
that
was
necessary
was
to
put
the
instructions
into
a
tape
machine
and
the
mass
of
wires
valves
resistors
condensors
and
chokes
did
the
rest
the
answer
appearing
on
another
tape
The
existence
of
this
society
the
Alchemists
since
was
a
concession
to
the
modern
world
but
otherwise
Sherborne
was
indeed
unspoilt
neither
war
nor
end
of
empire
had
much
modified
the
training
of
administrators
for
the
s
and
s
There
were
however
more
and
more
cracks
appearing
in
Alan's
stiff
upper
lip
and
although
deploring
his
tendency
to
fritter
his
time
away
he
was
not
finding
it
quite
so
important
to
keep
his
nose
permanently
to
the
grindstone
Typically
he
had
made
a
game
out
of
the
difficult
process
of
breaking
the
ice
so
that
when
among
friends
notably
Robin
and
his
friend
Christopher
Bennett
they
would
share
what
Alan
chose
to
call
sagas
or
saga-ettes
A
saga
would
have
to
enjoy
the
dimensions
of
the
Arnold
story
but
a
saga-ette
might
have
more
modest
proportions
of
self-revelation
Alan
would
tell
the
saga-ette
of
a
particular
Paris
adventure
Alan
had
picked
up
a
young
man
and
insisted
on
walking
back
to
his
hotel
instead
of
taking
the
Metro
This
caused
amazement
Alan
said
because
he
thought
of
Paris
like
you
or
I
would
think
of
a
Riemann
surface
he
only
knew
the
circles
of
convergence
round
every
Metro
station
and
couldn't
analytically
continue
from
one
to
another!
In
the
hotel
the
boy
had
solemnly
lifted
up
the
mattress
and
inserted
his
trousers
pour
conserver
les
plis
which
this
time
amazed
Alan
who
never
had
a
visible
crease
and
wanted
to
get
on
with
it
Afterwards
the
boy
had
made
up
some
story
about
exchanging
their
watches
so
as
to
prove
their
trust
for
each
other
until
they
met
next
day
so
Alan
showed
his
trust
and
lost
the
watch
but
considered
it
worth
the
sacrifice
Alan
and
Robin
would
also
point
out
this
or
that
pleasant
sight
in
the
street
each
catering
to
the
taste
of
the
other
Robin's
interests
were
more
uniformly
distributed
Is
that
what
you
call
a
pretty
girl
Alan
once
asked
allowing
the
suggestion
to
stand
that
he
thought
he
ought
at
least
in
principle
to
expand
his
own
interests
Once
Alan
had
been
persuaded
that
self-exploration
and
self-revelation
were
worthwhile
goals
he
pursued
them
in
his
uncompromising
way
In
the
computer
laboratory
for
instance
a
young
man
whom
Alan
found
particularly
attractive
once
arrived
from
London
to
use
the
computer
Who's
that
beautiful
young
man
Alan
immediately
asked
Tony
Brooker
who
explained
An
invitation
to
dinner
for
the
young
PhD
rapidly
followed
but
Alan
found
himself
fobbed
off
with
a
thin
excuse
of
which
he
took
a
dim
view
about
having
to
visit
a
sick
aunt
Franz
Greenbaum
had
a
theory
that
Alan's
attention
was
drawn
to
those
who
in
some
way
either
resembled
himself
or
what
he
would
like
to
be
a
rather
commonplace
observation
perhaps
and
of
the
psychoanalytical
kind
where
any
exception
could
be
taken
to
prove
the
rule
But
it
intrigued
Alan
who
apparently
had
never
thought
out
such
ideas
before
One
person
who
encouraged
this
development
was
Lyn
Newman
who
became
another
of
the
small
group
of
human
beings
whom
Alan
could
trust
There
was
a
playful
element
in
his
correspondence
The
attribution
to
may
here
be
wrong
This
fragment
of
a
letter
in
KCC
was
headed
only
May
it
might
have
been
May
It
was
a
note
of
apology
for
not
visiting
the
Newmans
who
retained
their
house
in
a
village
outside
Cambridge
when
on
a
visit
to
Cambridge
two
weeks
or
so
earlier
I
found
such
a
round
of
gaieties
had
been
arranged
for
me
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
get
out
to
see
you
Nothing
else
of
this
correspondence
has
survived
my
suspicion
is
that
it
probably
held
the
most
revealing
and
sophisticated
psychological
comment
that
he
ever
put
into
letters
But
also
of
course
an
area
where
AMT's
life
could
not
be
separated
from
the
privacy
of
others
Mrs
Newman
died
in
some
of
it
in
French
with
her
but
it
represented
a
serious
cracking
of
the
male
shell
He
wrote
to
Lyn
Newman
in
May
that
Greenbaum
has
made
great
strides
in
the
last
few
weeks
We
seem
to
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
root
of
the
trouble
now
To
be
seeing
a
psychoanalyst
foreign
and
Jewish
at
that
was
of
course
another
source
of
stigma
and
certainly
a
drastic
departure
from
his
early
background
It
was
typical
of
him
that
he
should
write
in
this
open
nonchalant
way
Nor
was
Lyn
Newman
a
privileged
confidante
in
the
respect
thus
Alan
had
also
made
friends
with
Michael
Polanyi's
young
son
John
recognising
in
him
a
budding
chemist
inviting
him
to
dinner
to
talk
about
morphogenesis
and
presenting
him
with
an
envelope
labelled
scrapings
from
Alan
Turing's
kitchen
It
contained
samples
from
a
mysterious
growth
on
the
wall
which
he
optimistically
imagined
that
John
Polanyi
could
identify
While
away
in
Canada
John
had
a
letter
from
Alan
Letter
to
the
author
from
Professor
J
Polanyi
full
of
hope
for
the
future
and
praise
for
his
analyst
By
spring
he
was
also
being
invited
to
the
Greenbaums
house
from
time
to
time
for
Franz
Greenbaum
whom
the
Manchester
intellectual
establishment
did
not
consider
a
very
respectable
figure
was
not
bound
by
the
strict
Freudian
view
of
relations
between
therapist
and
client
Alan
quite
failed
to
communicate
with
Mrs
Greenbaum
but
became
fond
of
playing
with
their
daughter
Maria
He
made
a
particular
hit
by
giving
her
a
box
of
sweets
saying
it
was
a
special
left-handed
tin
for
her
Once
he
amazed
Mrs
Greenbaum
by
his
excitement
over
a
youth
in
the
next
door
garden
whom
she
did
not
think
at
all
attractive
She
thought
him
obsessed
by
sex
but
he
was
obsessed
with
truth
at
the
cost
of
crudity
The
probation
period
ended
in
April
For
the
past
three
months
they
had
put
an
implant
of
hormone
into
his
thigh
instead
of
the
dosage
of
pills
Suspecting
with
some
annoyance
that
the
effect
would
last
more
than
three
months
he
had
it
taken
out
Then
he
was
free
the
more
so
because
his
future
at
Manchester
was
secure
On
May
the
University
Council
formally
voted
Minutes
of
the
University
Council
show
that
this
had
been
decided
by
January
or
February
to
appoint
him
to
a
specially
created
Readership
in
the
Theory
of
Computing
when
the
five
years
of
the
old
position
ran
out
on
September
This
he
could
reasonably
expect
to
last
for
ten
years
if
he
wanted
it
In
this
respect
his
insouciant
Pooh!
to
Don
Bayley
had
been
justified
he
had
a
small
pay
rise
and
freedom
to
work
exactly
as
he
chose
On
May
Alan
sent
a
letter
to
Maria
Greenbaum
describing
a
complete
solution
to
a
solitaire
puzzle
and
ending
I
hope
you
all
have
a
very
nice
holiday
in
Italian
Switzerland
I
shall
not
be
very
far
away
at
Club
Mediterran
e
Ipsos-Corfu
Greece
Yours
Alan
Turing
He
had
already
most
likely
in
been
to
a
Club
Mediterran
e
on
the
French
coast
In
this
summer
of
probably
over
the
period
of
the
coronation
At
Whitsun
May
he
was
due
at
Guildford
and
on
May
at
Cambridge
for
Robin's
PhD
oral
examination
so
his
holiday
was
most
likely
in
early
June
Caliban
escaped
from
the
island
for
his
brief
ration
of
fun
to
Paris
for
a
short
while
and
then
to
Corfu
He
would
return
with
half
a
dozen
Greek
names
and
addresses
As
note
although
from
this
point
of
view
his
exploration
of
the
eastern
Mediterranean
proved
disappointing
As
at
school
he
made
mistakes
with
the
French
but
still
did
better
than
with
the
Greek
On
the
beach
in
Corfu
with
the
dark
mountains
of
Albania
on
the
horizon
he
could
study
both
the
seaweed
and
the
boys
Stalin
was
dead
and
a
watery
sunshine
was
emerging
over
a
new
Europe
Even
the
cold
shabbiness
of
British
culture
was
not
immune
to
change
and
after
more
than
ten
years
of
ration
books
a
quite
new
mood
one
that
no
one
had
planned
for
was
coming
with
the
growth
of
the
Fifties
Television
its
development
arrested
in
made
its
first
mass
impact
with
the
coronation
In
a
far
more
complex
and
more
affluent
Britain
the
boundaries
of
official
and
unofficial
ideas
would
become
less
clear
An
outsider
an
intellectual
beatnik
like
Alan
Turing
might
find
more
room
to
breathe
Besides
the
general
relaxation
of
manners
the
diversification
of
life
was
most
acute
in
questions
of
sex
As
in
the
s
the
greater
official
consciousness
of
sexuality
was
matched
by
a
greater
outspokenness
on
the
part
of
individuals
and
most
notably
in
America
where
the
process
had
begun
earlier
than
in
Britain
One
particular
example
of
this
the
American
novel
Finist
re
Fritz
Peters
Finist
re
Gollancz
which
had
appeared
in
was
much
admired
by
Alan
It
described
the
relationship
between
a
fifteen-year-old
boy
and
his
teacher
and
like
The
Cloven
Pine
tried
to
see
life
through
teenage
eyes
It
was
however
a
relationship
very
different
from
the
vague
nuances
of
Fred
Clayton's
cri
de
coeur
In
the
old
days
Alan
had
often
teased
Fred
shocking
him
with
rather
over-simplified
assertions
about
the
prevalence
of
homosexual
activity
and
this
was
a
book
which
caught
up
with
the
serious
thread
that
had
underlain
that
delight
in
gossip
a
wish
to
defy
the
social
stigma
and
discuss
sex
in
the
same
way
as
one
might
discuss
anything
else
Meanwhile
Finist
re
also
did
full
justice
to
the
reality
of
the
social
taboo
and
its
plot
followed
a
complex
pattern
of
private
and
public
disclosures
These
the
novelist
made
lead
to
a
conclusion
of
hopeless
doom
as
though
homosexual
life
were
something
inherently
self-contradictory
and
fatal
the
strip
of
sand
the
distinct
footprints
leading
in
one
single
trail
into
the
black
water
In
its
tragic
end
its
suicide
at
a
symbolic
end
of
the
earth
as
also
with
its
linking
of
the
boy's
longing
for
a
man
friend
with
the
failure
of
his
parents
marriage
Finist
re
took
its
place
amidst
the
older
genre
of
writing
about
homosexuality
It
brought
a
post-war
explicitness
into
an
already
dated
form
By
the
point
had
been
well
made
that
gay
men
could
muddle
through
like
anyone
else
thus
the
new
English
novel
The
Heart
in
Exile
Rodney
Garland
The
Heart
in
Exile
W
H
Allen
wended
its
way
through
the
fading
drama-ettes
of
upper
middle
class
taboos
and
the
more
modern
obsession
with
psychological
explanations
and
rejected
both
for
an
ordinary
commonplace
ending
tempered
by
the
observation
that
the
battle
must
continue
Angus
Wilson's
Hemlock
and
After
with
its
bleak
black
comedy
of
class
and
manners
was
also
close
to
the
matter-of-fact
modernity
about
sex
that
Alan
liked
to
display
This
was
another
book
that
he
and
Robin
discussed
more
evidence
that
officialdom
and
clinical
management
were
not
the
only
legacies
of
the
Second
World
War
Yet
Alan
Turing
could
not
share
in
this
anarchic
spirit
as
he
might
have
wished
Less
free
than
he
appeared
he
too
was
on
the
shore
of
life
A
year
later
on
the
evening
of
June
he
killed
himself

LOWEST
OF
THE
LOW
Disillusioned
with
the
ministry
before
he
had
even
entered
it
Vincent
now
said
damningly
that
to
trade
in
religion
was
on
a
par
with
trading
in
art
or
tulip
bulbs
That
one
would
have
thought
was
an
indictment
sweeping
enough
to
settle
the
matter
once
and
for
all
But
it
was
not
He
still
burned
to
preach
the
Gospel
to
the
poor
and
to
help
them
Back
again
at
the
parsonage
at
Etten
he
must
have
pleaded
with
sufficient
eloquence
to
convince
his
father
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
try
His
stay
at
home
coincided
with
a
visit
from
the
Reverend
Jones
of
Isleworth
who
had
kept
in
touch
and
was
now
a
friend
of
the
family
The
two
clergymen
went
with
him
on
a
trip
to
Laeken
near
Brussels
Vincent's
father
knew
of
a
school
there
for
training
mission
workers
It
was
an
establishment
that
placed
more
emphasis
on
public
speaking
than
on
a
knowledge
of
the
classics
and
the
course
was
shorter
and
more
intensive
than
anything
comparable
in
Holland
So
on
August
the
failed
scholar
bookseller
and
art
dealer
arrived
in
Laeken
to
start
a
three-month
trial
period
In
his
first
letter
from
there
he
makes
a
significant
little
admission
to
Theo
and
encloses
a
sketch
I
should
like
to
begin
making
hasty
sketches
of
some
of
the
many
things
I
meet
but
as
it
would
probably
keep
me
from
my
real
work
it
is
better
not
to
start
Poised
to
begin
his
real
work
as
a
missionary
among
the
wretched
of
the
earth
a
holy
man
at
last
he
is
paralleled
in
time
with
Tolstoy
In
this
same
year
by
an
extraordinary
confluence
their
spiritual
paths
crossed
though
they
were
travelling
from
opposite
directions
Vincent
would
move
on
from
evangelist
to
artist
and
the
great
Russian
determined
to
live
a
life
modelled
on
Christ
was
beginning
to
regard
all
art
as
frivolous
In
July
the
month
in
which
Vincent
was
enrolled
at
the
mission
school
a
desperate
Tolstoy
and
his
friend
Stakhov
set
off
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
Optina
Pustyn
Monastery
not
far
from
Moscow
Tolstoy
uneasy
about
his
wealth
wanted
to
reject
violence
in
all
its
forms
and
live
like
a
peasant
Vincent
would
soon
see
the
struggle
to
turn
himself
into
what
he
called
a
Peasant
painter
as
his
prime
aim
In
a
diary
started
in
the
spring
of
Tolstoy
wrote
Read
the
Gospels
Christ
says
everywhere
that
everything
temporal
is
false
and
that
only
the
abstract
is
real
The
terms
would
not
have
been
Vincent's
but
the
note
of
absolute
certainty
could
be
his
The
religion
Tolstoy
was
to
advocate
was
remarkably
like
the
only
one
Vincent
could
wholeheartedly
contemplate
a
practical
religion
not
promising
future
bliss
but
bliss
on
earth
Close
to
the
end
of
his
life
Vincent
referred
approvingly
to
Tolstoy's
My
Religion
and
spoke
of
his
hopes
for
a
private
and
secret
revolution
in
men
from
which
a
new
religion
will
be
born
something
altogether
new
which
will
have
no
name
but
will
have
the
same
effect
of
comforting
of
making
life
possible
which
the
Christian
religion
used
to
have
His
probationary
period
nearly
over
he
was
suddenly
hauled
before
the
committee
on
evangelisation
and
told
that
he
was
unsuitable
Vincent
was
shattered
His
state
was
serious
enough
for
his
father
to
be
called
He
had
failed
because
of
a
lack
of
talent
for
impromptu
speaking
considered
essential
for
the
task
he
was
contemplating
He
was
also
it
seems
notably
short
on
humility
Two
of
Vincent's
instructors
later
described
their
impressions
of
this
eager
novice
who
did
not
know
what
submission
was
According
to
one
report
Vincent
was
as
dismissive
of
academic
study
as
he
had
been
in
Amsterdam
A
master
asked
him
on
one
occasion
whether
a
word
was
nominative
or
dative
and
back
came
his
answer
I
don't
really
care
sir!
Another
time
in
a
French
lesson
when
the
word
falaise
cliff
was
being
discussed
he
jumped
up
and
asked
if
he
could
illustrate
the
word
by
drawing
a
cliff
on
the
blackboard
The
master
said
no
At
the
end
of
the
lesson
the
excitable
Dutchman
got
hold
of
a
piece
of
chalk
and
began
to
draw
a
cliff
on
the
board
One
pupil
laughing
behind
his
back
tugged
at
his
jacket
to
distract
him
All
at
once
Vincent
swung
round
His
face
contorted
with
rage
he
lashed
out
shocking
everyone
with
his
show
of
violence
Clearly
he
had
little
aptitude
for
meekness
either
Where
next
While
at
Laeken
he
had
seen
miners
strange
grisly
beings
to
him
He
made
a
sketch
of
the
inn
they
frequented
adjoining
a
big
coal
shed
They
would
call
in
for
a
glass
of
beer
on
their
way
back
from
a
shift
Enclosing
this
sketch
in
his
letter
Mons
he
mentioned
a
district
he
had
heard
about
called
the
Borinage
It
was
possible
that
even
a
reject
like
him
could
be
of
use
in
such
a
godforsaken
spot
He
made
enquiries
Yes
he
could
go
there
if
he
wished
as
a
lay
evangelist
Fired
with
enthusiasm
he
wrote
to
Theo
Experience
has
shown
that
people
who
walk
in
the
darkness
like
the
miners
in
the
black
coal
mines
for
instance
are
very
impressed
by
the
works
of
the
Gospel
and
believe
them
too
The
Borinage
desolate
and
impoverished
was
a
coalfield
in
the
south-west
of
Belgium
near
a
region
of
flat
blasted
lands
surmounted
by
slag
heaps
of
waste
One
assumes
that
his
father
financed
this
latest
venture
He
probably
thought
it
would
be
short-lived
In
fact
Vincent
spent
twenty-two
months
in
this
terrible
black
country
a
period
nearly
as
long
as
his
stay
in
France
For
thirty
Belgian
francs
a
month
he
lodged
with
a
pedlar
by
the
name
of
van
der
Haegen
who
lived
at
Paturages
not
far
from
Mons
the
house
was
demolished
in
the
early
s
to
allow
for
road
widening
As
soon
as
he
got
there
he
set
to
work
He
visited
the
sick
taught
his
landlord's
children
and
gave
Bible
readings
in
the
locality
He
was
as
shocked
here
as
he
had
been
by
the
scenes
he
had
witnessed
in
London's
East
End
These
were
the
realities
of
grinding
poverty
the
price
paid
in
human
terms
for
that
age
of
worldwide
industrial
expansion
into
which
he
had
been
born
It
festered
here
under
his
nose
And
somehow
in
a
setting
that
had
once
been
rural
it
seemed
yet
more
dire
The
place
was
indescribably
filthy
and
hopeless
The
miners
were
emaciated
old
before
their
time
and
so
were
their
bedraggled
staring
women
At
the
centre
of
all
that
lived
and
moved
in
this
ghastly
universe
was
the
mine
Around
it
clustered
the
settlement
of
miners
huts
Dead
trees
stuck
up
together
with
blackened
thorn
hedges
dunghills
heaps
of
worthless
coal
In
the
middle
of
his
harrowing
report
he
let
slip
a
sentence
and
we
hear
from
that
monster
of
objectivity
inside
every
artist
who
sees
everything
as
grist
to
the
mill
Maris
he
wrote
could
make
a
wonderful
picture
of
it
It
was
a
hell
of
human
vileness
he
had
fallen
into
a
great
raw
wound
crying
out
to
be
bandaged
But
what
was
one
person
able
to
do
here
So
many
sickly
and
feverish
people
were
wandering
about
some
of
them
half-maimed
some
burned
from
explosions
All
were
trapped
in
something
inhuman
into
which
they
had
dumbly
delivered
themselves
The
only
real
life
curiously
enough
was
underground
in
the
pit
of
hell
itself
Out
on
the
surface
the
villages
struck
him
as
being
stunned
dead
and
forsaken
The
men
themselves
could
hardly
bear
to
be
above
ground
at
least
down
below
they
had
each
other
Vincent
asked
to
be
wound
down
to
the
pit
bottom
He
saw
the
weird
underworld
life
for
himself
and
heard
the
horrible
drip
of
water
leaking
through
Children
boys
and
girls
were
loading
small
carts
to
be
dragged
along
by
old
horses
Vincent
spoke
almost
enviously
of
the
miners
darkness
and
the
chance
it
gave
them
to
reclaim
the
light
He
soon
came
to
appreciate
their
special
character
their
solidarity
and
mutual
trust
their
innate
hatred
for
anyone
who
was
domineering
their
intelligence
and
quickness
in
spite
of
being
unable
to
read
or
write
Above
all
he
was
impressed
by
their
bravery
and
the
haunting
mournfulness
of
their
deep-set
eyes
Winter
was
soon
upon
him
It
gladdened
him
to
see
how
even
these
degraded
surroundings
were
touched
by
a
curious
beauty
as
he
watched
the
little
gangs
of
miners
making
their
way
home
black
as
sweeps
in
the
white
snow
at
twilight
Their
houses
no
more
than
huts
were
scattered
along
the
sunken
tracks
or
half
hidden
in
woods
or
else
perched
on
the
slopes
of
the
low
hills
You
could
see
the
candlelight
flickering
through
the
small-paned
windows
under
roofs
covered
in
moss
It
was
somehow
medieval
and
hushed
in
the
shadow
of
the
pit
and
its
fiendish
machinery
These
squat
frank
men
working
skilfully
and
terribly
hard
who
said
little
but
had
quick
nervous
responses
were
not
his
equals
he
saw
them
rather
as
his
superiors
How
could
his
role
safe
on
the
surface
with
the
women
be
compared
with
theirs
Everything
here
fed
his
masochism
as
he
had
known
instinctively
that
it
would
when
he
applied
for
a
similar
position
in
the
English
coalfields
some
years
before
only
to
be
told
that
he
was
not
mature
enough
Now
there
were
other
motives
being
satisfied
and
scores
being
subtly
settled
Vincent's
father
spent
more
time
ministering
to
the
Catholic
majority
than
to
his
own
Protestant
flock
in
the
Brabant
Vincent
in
Catholic
Belgium
although
emulating
his
father
once
again
was
also
mocking
him
by
going
to
the
limit
in
a
way
that
passed
judgement
on
his
parents
safe
Christianity
while
putting
himself
beyond
criticism
Christ
would
surely
have
acted
as
he
Vincent
was
doing
Therefore
he
was
the
true
follower
of
Jesus
Christ
Instead
of
lagging
woefully
behind
he
had
surpassed
them
He
had
come
to
the
Borinage
as
his
parents
representative
dressed
correctly
in
the
approved
manner
his
accents
refined
and
showed
in
his
appearance
all
the
characteristics
of
Dutch
cleanliness
But
not
for
long
Spiritual
instruction
was
the
last
thing
these
downtrodden
people
needed
he
argued
Instead
of
Bible
teaching
he
ought
to
be
translating
fine
words
into
deeds
He
changed
direction
almost
overnight
Then
in
January
the
Mission
School
committee
relented
and
informed
his
father
that
he
could
have
a
temporary
post
after
all
Vincent
was
sent
to
near-by
Wasmes
and
given
a
salary
of
fifty
Belgian
francs
a
month
Overjoyed
at
having
a
recognised
part
to
play
he
taught
the
Scriptures
but
spent
most
of
his
time
assisting
the
poor
and
the
ailing
Even
in
this
hell-hole
he
found
a
kind
of
salvation
Being
a
combination
of
social
worker
medical
auxiliary
and
teacher
to
these
miners
and
their
families
meant
that
he
was
able
to
break
out
of
the
prison
of
his
hateful
loneliness
Besides
it
was
fitting
that
he
should
serve
a
people
who
were
so
obviously
more
admirable
as
human
beings
than
himself
His
compulsion
to
be
of
service
and
to
act
from
his
feelings
had
found
its
outlet
He
had
been
pressing
for
the
opportunity
to
abandon
himself
free
of
dogma
and
here
it
was
He
was
his
own
master
dedicated
only
to
Christ
who
had
asserted
the
brotherhood
of
man
If
he
neglected
his
physical
body
there
was
no
one
here
to
reprimand
him
for
the
whole
community
was
woefully
neglected
His
heart
was
appalled
by
what
he
saw
but
in
his
heart
also
there
lurked
a
triumph
This
hell
he
had
entered
could
be
his
heaven
Soon
whatever
he
did
no
matter
how
hard
and
long
he
worked
it
was
not
enough
Apocryphal
stories
abound
Like
Walt
Whitman
who
became
a
wound
dresser
in
the
American
Civil
War
in
order
to
draw
closer
to
the
simple
young
soldiers
he
adored
and
whom
he
wished
to
tend
Vincent
sought
to
draw
nearer
to
Christ
First
he
threw
off
his
respectability
exchanging
it
for
an
old
soldier's
tunic
and
a
shabby
cap
Nothing
was
enough
Nothing
satisfied
his
urge
to
descend
lower
until
he
was
low
enough
to
identify
with
these
men
who
lay
entombed
in
cramped
cells
and
crawled
on
all
fours
in
the
dark
Through
them
he
would
know
Christ
