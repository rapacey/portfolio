2A)

In the Week 8 Lab Exercise Problem 3 part b, you wrote a BRE pattern that will match any line containing CS followed by a blank followed by a 3-digit number.
For this problem, write a BRE that includes an appropriate interval expression that will match any line containing JUST CS followed by a blank followed by a 3-digit number.

^CS [0-9]\{3\}$

2B)

Write a BRE that includes an appropriate interval expression that will match any line that includes a sequence of 4 or more uppercase letters within it.

[A-Z]\{4,\}

2C)

Write a BRE that includes an appropriate interval expression that will match any line containing JUST 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 lowercase letters.

^[a-z]\{5,8\}$

2D)

Write a BRE that will match any line that contains JUST a string of 1 or more Xs followed by a dash followed by the SAME number of Xs.

(So, for example, these should match:
X-X
XX-XX
XXX-XXX
...but these should not:
XX-XXX
XXXX-X
)

(^\(X\{1,\}\)-\1$

2E)

Write a BRE that will match any line that contains a repeated string of 1 or more digits.

\([0-9]\{1,\}\)\1
