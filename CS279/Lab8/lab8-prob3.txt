A) Write a BRE pattern that will match any line starting with Romeo: (this might grab each of Romeo's first lines from a script, for example).

grep '^Romeo:'

B) Write a BRE pattern that will match any line containing CS followed by a blank followed by a 3-digit number. (There is more than one reasonable BRE for this.)

grep 'CS [0-9][0-9][0-9]'

C) Write a BRE pattern that will match any line ending with a semicolon.

grep ';$'

D) Write a BRE pattern that will match any line ending with either a semicolon OR a curly brace OR a closing parenthesis.

grep '[;})]$'

E) Write a BRE pattern that will match any line containing one followed by any single character followed by two.

grep 'one.two'

F) Write a BRE pattern that will match any line containing main.txt (but not one containing just mainytxt or just main3txt etc.)

grep 'main\.txt'

G) Write a BRE pattern that will match any line starting with an x followed by zero or more y characters.

grep '^xy*'

H) Write a BRE pattern that will match any line that starts with a lowercase letter and ends with an uppercase letter.

grep '^[[:lower:]].*[[:upper:]]$'

I) Note that ! is special and will need to be escaped. Write a BRE pattern that will match the first line that should start a CS 279 bash shell script

grep '^#\!/bin/bash'

J) It may vary a bit by locale, but basically the character class [[:blank:]] matches space and tab. Using this character class, write a BRE pattern that will match any line ending with one or more spaces and/or tabs.

grep '[[:blank:]][[:blank:]]*$'
