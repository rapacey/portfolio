1A)

Write a grep command whose output will be just the names of files in the current directory that contain the line: #!/bin/bash

grep '#\!/bin/bash' *

1B)

Now write a command that uses the tee command to capture the piped output of your grep command from 1 part a into the file script-list.txt before piping it onward to a wc command whose output will be the number of lines piped to it.

grep '#\!/bin/bash' * | tee script-list.txt | wc -l

1C)

Write the output of your command from 1 part b when you run it in the Lab10 directory.

1D)

Fun Fact: if you call wc with more than one file, it lists the desired count(s) as well as the file name.

Write a command whose output will be the number of lines in each of the files in the current directory.

wc -l *

1E)

Now write a command that used the tee command to capture the piped output of your wc command from 1 part d into a file line-sizes.txt before piping it to the sort command (which will then display these in order of least number of lines to the most number of lines).

wc -l * | tee line-sizes.txt | sort -n

1F)

Run your command from 1 part e in the driver's ~/bin directory, redirecting its output into a file sorted-order.txt.

wc -l * | tee line-sizes.txt | sort -n > sorted-order.txt

Submit your file lab10-prob1.txt as well as the files script-list.txt,
line-sizes.txt, and sorted-order.txt.
