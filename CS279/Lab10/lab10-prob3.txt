A) Consider the ERE:

for\ (.+)\ in\ (.+)$

This should match for loops within a Bash shell script.

B) Consider the first line of an if statement:

if [[ $next_line =~ for\ (.+)\ in\ (.+)$ ]]

${BASH_REMATCH[1]} should contain the loop variable (the part between for and in)

${BASH_REMATCH[2]} should contain the list of items or range being iterated over (everything after the word in until the end of the line)

C) Write a Bash script grab-for-info.sh

D) In your current working directory, create a copy of one of the Bash scripts

Run your script grab-for-info.sh on one of those files, redirecting the result into a file grab-for-demo.txt
