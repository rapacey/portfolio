A) Create a regular file some-commands.txt that includes at least 3 Unix or Linux commands

nano some-commands.txt

Now create a symbolic/soft link named ref-s-commands.txt that refers to the file some-commands.txt

ln -s some-commands.txt ref-s-commands.txt

Now create a hard link named ref-h-commands.txt that refers to the file some-commands.txt

ln some-commands.txt ref-h-commands.txt

Write one or more ls -li commands to show the names and i-node numbers of the three files

ls -l some-commands.txt ref-s-commands.txt ref-h-commands.txt

Paste the results of these commands for your answer

4067588 -rw-rw-r-- 2 robpacey robpacey 116 Jan 18 08:34 ref-h-commands.txt
4067576 lrwxrwxrwx 1 robpacey robpacey  17 Jan 18 08:38 ref-s-commands.txt -> some-commands.txt
4067588 -rw-rw-r-- 2 robpacey robpacey 116 Jan 18 08:34 some-commands.txt

B) Write a find command that will find and print the names of all symbolic links reachable from your home directory

find ~ -type l | -print

C) Write a find command that will find and list all symbolic links in the current directory

find . -type l | ls -l

D) Call wc for ref-h-commands.txt, ref-s-commands.txt and some-commands.txt and paste the results as the first part of your answer

 24  24 116 some-commands.txt
 24  24 116 ref-s-commands.txt
 24  24 116 ref-h-commands.txt
 72  72 348 total

Using nano, add the name of at least one additional Unix or Linux command of your choice to some-commands.txt and save that change

Now, again call wc for both ref-commands.txt and some-commands.txt and paste int he results as the second part of your answer

 27  27 129 some-commands.txt
 27  27 129 ref-s-commands.txt
 27  27 129 ref-h-commands.txt
