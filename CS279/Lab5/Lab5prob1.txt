CS 279 - Week 5 Lab Exercise - January 16, 2026

Type in your answers WITHIN this file
(do NOT delete the questions!)

Type YOUR NAME after the line:
===============================

Rob Pacey

1. $0 within a shell script has as its value the name used for the
calling shell script.

What is the value of $0 when called from an interactive shell?

Type below the result you get when you
run the command:

echo $0
============

When called from an interactive shell, the special parameter $0 expands to the name of the shell or the path used to invoke it.

bash

2. We will be talking more about bash environment variables!
BUT in the meantime, we mentioned in our intro to them so far
that the env command, when called with no arguments, will list
all of the current shell's currently-in-effect environment variables
and their values.

...then choose one of the environment variables listed and type
its name=value pair below:
============

SHELL=/bin/bash

3. Also as part of our intro-so-far to environment variables:
we mentioned that subprocesses inherit copies of them.
Consider the environment variable you chose as your answer
for question 2.

Create a small bash script prob1-play or prob1-play.sh that
has the usual first line and a comment containing at least both
of your names, that then echoes the value of that environment
variable to the screen.

When you execute your script, type below what it prints to
the screen.
============

Bash Script prob1-play.sh

#!/bin/bash
# Name: Rob Pacey
echo $USER

./prob1-play.sh
robpacey

4. Do you get similar behavior with a "regular" local shell variable?

In your current nrs-projects ssh session, create a local variable
prob1_val:

prob1_val="TESTING"

...and,

*still in your current ssh session*

, execute the command:

echo "\$prob1_val: $prob1_val"

Type below what is output to the screen by the above command.
============

$prob1_val: TESTING

5. Now, add the following command to your bash script prob1-play or prob1-play.sh:

echo "\$prob1_val: $prob1_val"

When you now execute prob1-play, type below *both* lines that are now printed
to the screen.
============

robpacey
[blank line]

The script runs in a new subprocess and the local variable doesn't transfer over without the export command.

6. And now, again back in your current ssh session, again execute the command:

echo "\$prob1_val: $prob1_val"

Type below what is output this time to the screen by the above command.
============

$prob1_val: TESTING

7. Now add two commands to your bash script prob1-play or prob1-play.sh,

* one CHANGING the value of the inherited environment you echoed to the
screen earlier in this script,

* and one that now again echoes the value of that environment variable
to the screen.

When you now execute prob1-play, type below *all 3* lines that are now printed
to the screen.
============

robpacey
/bin/bash
[blank line]

8.
*Back in your current ssh session*

, type in a command that echoes to the screen the value of the environment variable you echoed and
changed within prob1-play or prob1-play.sh.

Type below what is printed to the screen by that command.
============

echo "$USER"
robpacey
