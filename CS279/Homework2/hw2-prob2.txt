Homework 2

Problem 2

Consider a directory with the following files:

lab1.txt	lab2.txt	lab3.txt	OLDlab1.txt	 		
OLDlab4.txt	ancestors.pl	save-it		slab-msrmts.txt
rules.txt	lab45.rkt	lab754.pl	lab9.cpp

A) Write an ls command with a SINGLE argument including file expansion wildcard character(s)
after its option, that would give a long-list (including file permissions) of only those files with a suffix of .txt

ls -l *.txt

B) It turns out that save-it is a directory. Write a command, that uses only a SINGLE argument
including file expansion wildcard character(s) before the directory name save-it, that would copy ONLY those files
with a suffix of .txt whose names before this suffix consist only of lab followed by 0 or more characters.

cp lab*.txt ~/Homework/CS279/Homework2/save-it
