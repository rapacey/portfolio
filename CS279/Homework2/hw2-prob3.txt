Homework 2

Problem 3

Consider the directory /example/cbrown. It contains the subdirectory football that contains:

game1-score.txt		f22-schedule.txt 	past-seasons

where past-seasons is itself a directory that contains:

f21-schedule.txt	f21-scores	f20-schedule.txt	f20-scores

A) Give the absolute pathname for the f21-schedule.txt file described above

~/Homework/CS279/Homework2/example/cbrown/past-seasons/f21.schedule.txt/

B) Assume that you are within the directory /example/cbrown (and that you have appropriate permissions)

Write a single command using a relative pathname that would give the long listing (including permissions)
for the file f20-schedule.txt described above

ls -l ./football/past-seasons/f20-schedule.txt

C) Assume that you are within the directory /example/cbrown (and that you have appropriate permissions)

Write a single command that would move file f22-schedule.txt described above into the directory past-seasons described above

mv ./football/f22-schedule.txt ./football/past-seasons/

D) Assume that you are within the directory past-seasons described above. Write a single command without changing your current working directory
and without using an absolute pathname that will give the long listing (including permissions) for the directory football described above.

*Note that we want the permissions for the directory itself, not for its contents.

ls -ld ..
