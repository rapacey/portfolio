A) Display only the first five lines of the file .bash_profile.

head -n 5 .bash_profile

B) Find all the differences between the contents of the files tweedledee and tweedledum, but only display the resulting lines that include twins somewhere within them. Then do a search of those lines for the character string "twins".

diff tweedledee tweedledum | grep "twins"

C) Change all appearances of the text string Sonoma in file SSU.txt to the string Humboldt, and save the resulting text to a new file named Humboldt.txt.

sed 's/Sonoma/Humboldt/g' SSU.txt > Humboldt.txt

D) Show the last 4 lines of every file in the current directory with the suffix .txt.

tail -n 4 *.txt

E) You want to archive the directory 279tools and all of its contents. Write a command that will do so, resulting in an archive file 279tools.tar

tar -cvf 279tools.tar 279tools

F) You now want to compress 279tools.tar. Write a command that will do so, using gzip, that will also let you know how much this file was compressed.

gzip -v 279tools.tar

G) Your result from 3 part f has been copied or e-mailed to another directory somewhere. Assume the current working directory is this other directory with this copy of 3 part f's result. Give the command to now uncompress it.

gunzip 279tools.tar.gz

H) Now give the command to extract the directory 279tools and its contents from the result of your command in 3 part g.

tar -xvf 279tools.tar

I) Now give a command you could use to recursively list all of the contents either of this extracted copy of 279tools or of 279tools.tar

ls -R 279tools or find 279tools

J) Write a sed command that will add four blanks to the beginning of each line in file lookity.txt, putting the result in shift-look.txt. (Hint: think of it as substituting 4 blanks for the beginning of each line.)

sed 's/^/    /' lookity.txt > shift-look.txt
