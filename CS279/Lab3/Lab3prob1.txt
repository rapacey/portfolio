Type YOUR NAME after the line:
===============================

Rob Pacey

1. Consider this set of permissions:

-rw-r-----

Assume you have a file named lab1.txt in your current working
directory.

Write a chmod command that will explicitly give lab1.txt
these permissions.

============

chmod 640 lab1.txt

2. Consider this set of permissions:

drwxr-xr--

Assume you have a directory named lab-stuff in your current working
directory.

Write a chmod command that will explicitly give lab-stuff these
permissions.

============

chmod 754 lab-stuff

3. Assume you have a file named lab2.txt in your current working
directory.

Assume this chmod command is done:

chmod 664 lab2.txt

After this command is done, how would lab2.txt's permissions be
displayed by:

ls -l lab2.txt
============

-rw-rw-r--

4. Assume you have a directory named lab-things in your current
working directory.

Assume this chmod command is done:

chmod 711 lab-things

After this command is done, how would lab-things' permissions be
displayed by:

ls -ld lab-things
============

drwx--x--x

5. Write a shell command setting a local shell variable our_names so that
its value is both of your names.

============

our_names="Rob Pacey"

6. Write a shell command, using your shell variable from Problem 5,
that will echo the value of that shell variable you
created in Problem 5 to the screen.
============

echo "$our_names"

7. Fun fact: command wc, word count, can, as one of its possibilities,
be given the name of a file as its argument,
and it prints the number of lines, words, and bytes in that file.

Write a shell command setting a local variable stats so that its
value is the result of calling the wc command on this file
279lab03-prob1.txt.
============

stats=$(wc 279lab03-prob1.txt)

8. Write a shell command, using your variable from Problem 7,
that will echo the value of that shell variable you created
in Problem 7 to the screen.
============

echo "$stats"

9. Assume this shell command has been run:

question="How are you?"

For each statement below, type what it would print to the screen:

============

echo $question

How are you?

echo "$question is my question"

How are you? is my question

echo 'Why not ask $question'

Why not ask $question

echo \$question: $question

$question: How are you?

10. Assume this shell command has now also been run (after Problem 9's
shell command):

question2="What does it mean?"

For each statement below, type what it would print to the screen:

============

echo $question2

What does it mean?

echo ${question}2

How are you?2

11. Assume this shell command has been run:

let quantity=13

For each fragment below, type what the last line in that fragment
would print to the screen:

============

let quantity=$quantity+10
echo $quantity

23

let quantity=113
quantity=$quantity+20
echo $quantity

113+20

let quantity=213
quantity+=30
echo $quantity

21330

let quantity=313
let quantity+=40
echo $quantity

353
