A) There is a file named important-script.sh somewhere in the system

Write find command that will locate this file, such that:

Its result is to print its absolute pathname
It starts searching in the home directory
Redirects any error messages to /dev/null

find ~ -type f -name 'important-script.sh' -print 2> /dev/null

B) Paste in the absolute pathname your find command found for important-script.sh

/home/robpacey/Homework/CS279/Lab12/important-script.sh

C) Skipped

D) Choose a common file suffix with multiple instances in the CS279 directory (.sh, .cpp, .sql or .txt)

Write a find command starting in your home directory that will:

Print the absolute pathname of the result
Redirect error messages to /dev/null
After error redirection, pipe result to wc -l

find ~ -type f -name '*.sh' -print 2> /dev/null | wc -l

E) Paste in the number of files your find command found
