3A)

Write a sed command whose output will be the contents of play.txt except with the first instance of moo on each line replaced by MOO

sed 's/moo/Moo' play.txt

3B)

Write a sed command whose output will be the contents of play.txt except with 'MOO> ' added to the beginning of each line.

sed 's/^/MOO> /g' play.txt

3C)

Write a sed command whose output will be the contents of play.txt except with /**/ added to the end of lines containing a grep command.

sed '/grep/ s/$/\/\*\*\//' play.txt

3D)

Write a sed command whose output will be just the non-blank lines of file play.txt.

sed '/^$/d' play.txt

3E)

Write a sed command whose output will be everything except lines 8-22 of file play.txt.

sed '8,22d' play.txt

3F)

FUN FACT: you can have more than one command within a sed statement -- you just need to separate them with semicolons.

So, for example, the following will output everything except the first three lines of file play.txt, adding an exclamation point and a / to the end to each of those lines:

sed -e '1,3 d;s/$/!\//' play.txt

Write a single sed command whose output will be the contents of play.txt except with the first instance of red on each line replaced by RED! and all instances of black replaced by DARKNESS

sed -e 's/red/RED!/;s/black/DARKNESS/g' play.txt
